Feedback from previous essay:

Yes - to what extent
Evidence it - in what ways are we living in a new colonial reality?
What are the arguments we make in the knowledge production side of arguments?
Two key theorists who help underline this colonial reality:
Production of knowledge making
The subtler examples tend to have more traction in terms of our argument, and we can basically say: it's not just the bodies that are excluded, it's also that the knowledge making exercises are grounded in this relations, on account of inequality itself has limits. 


Put concepts really up front and centre. "Baudrillard helps us comprehend this change, transforming how we see reality"

I recognise its limitations, put outlandish examples.

Agree. Bring Du Bois' point front and centre - what is this new phase of imperialism, what was the previous one? Bring that example front and centre.

Du Bois - colour line theory, the veil, the status of economic imperialism

What can we append onto this discussion? Du Bois discussion is useful in defining this new wave of imperialism as one dictated through 'self-regulating' knowledge exercises. The implication is that if black folk did not see themselves as inferior, then 'equality' could be managed. Later in his life, he discusses the economic implications - foreign people control the currency.

Du Bois argument implies that should the 'colour-line' be recovered, military might might be removed then there would be equality.

# Conclusion

My conclusion: we are living in a distinctively new phase of colonial imperialism characterised through a change in knowledge-making exercises.

Du Bois
### The Colour Line

This term was coined by Frederick Douglas in the 1880s to refer to segregation.
Du Bois uses this term to note the segregation between the black and white population, and structural inequality

It's as though they're living in two different worlds.

### The Veil

The veil is a metaphor to describe the ways in which white people look at the Black population - of how White People conceive of Black People.

This lens makes it difficult for white people to appreciate Black people as full human beings.

It makes it difficult for Black people to conceive of themselves as full human beings.


### Double Consciousness

One reading is the notion of the psychological features of what it means to be black - that self-consciousness arises in a social context, tied to our ability to take the perspective of others.

There are two elements:
1. The situation for Black people is unique in that they can see themselves in two ways, from their perspective and of white people - perhaps seeing themselves through the lens of pity, condescension and pity
2. He contrasts the spiritual dimensions of Black Culture with the supposed materialism of American culture.

This is connected to a political ideology, connected to the veil, connected to the colour line.

The second meaning of consciousness, as African Americans they embody the meaning of being American *and* the African influence.
