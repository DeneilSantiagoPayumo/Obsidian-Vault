Mawani, Canadian Sociologist - she has a term called 'colonial proximity', oceans of law, where we are never far away from coloniality and we can see it in everyday inequalities. In what ways does this happen. It is useful for us to bring in any arguments, strong case to ask that question - it is not a yes or no, it's an obvious yes. It is to what extent.

Coming in with a strong argument about how legacies of empire are near to us in an everyday setting, using a postcolonial theorists to discuss it. For me, I should enter it not so much with a firm argument that decolonising is the answer but rather in what ways we can evidence these colonial relations in the present reality.

Higher education heavily influenced by the imperial project, the imaginaries and thoughts of the scholar bound up in this idea that they're potentially progressive, captured in this neo-liberal conceptions. Trans-Atlantic movement of slave inequalities, about extraction, coercion and such.

We're getting more into the structural dimensions of the colonial present. "The Ocean is Archived" - All the empires are moving past East Africa, capturing and moving to the Caribbean, to the U.S, using this ship and movement of bodies and exploitation and challenging that.

We are living in the 'cool new present' - here's why, we use thinkers to justify that terminology, that legacy, that number of examples as such. Then we take the next step, then we take key thinkers that allow us to explore that argument. That migration case is both conceptually significant (Rafa) is used to evidence the Colonial present.

Get that front end in!

What are the arguments we make in the knowledge production side of arguments? Liberal paradigms that set up "culture wars" where people stand on various different podiums. Where essentially they're talking over each other. It's the thinnest Euro-politics.

Deeply individualized tract - it does not address structural violence, it is beyond the institutions but shapes it and importantly it does not address the imperial histories behind the very hijacking of the university itself. Think of privatization, philanthropy, the marketisation of race theory, (liberal thinking) stereotype bias - deeply individualizing, against marginalized bodies, decolonizing agendas taking hold of the institutions. Legacies of this kind of violence. It's a nuanced view and we should capture that proximity and legacies, and perhaps move into two parts that would help with word-length: two key theorists that help us understand this reality.

How close are we to colonialism? We need material to wrap onto that.

Energizing discussion, the marketisation of ideas

Colonialism, everyday inequalities, the global conservative right. Taiwo - black scholar from US who wrote the 'the elite capture', how the elite control and rule things. I need to provide examples to illustrate these ideas. 

Wacquant, welfare state, "the projects", Philadelphia, the idea that the actual enslavement of people is captured in the modern city, people being in the 'ghetto'. 

We've got those examples - Brexit as a potential way of thinking of Imperialism, a colonial proximity. If you know where Brexit came from, Cambridge Analytica.

Cambridge Analytica - People You May Know (documentary)

Bhambra, talking about not only the kind of everyday kinds of things, or bigger political transformations, but actually the impact on European fragmentation, geopolitics, Russia, affiliation with Russia, really important political examples. What happened to global histories and its ability to recontextualise inequalities and knowledge making? We have the obvious knowledge inequalities, migration but the less obvious ones: reframing and recontextualising of knowledge making of the history of the transatlantic slave trade itself.

Think about what's going on at that new private university, Buckingham. Teaching whiteness as a way of life. [[Hannah Arendt]] - "Empire is a way of life."

Conclusions: 
Reframe the argument, [[Bhambra]] and [[Holmwood]] for instance.
Subtler examples of global inequalities, other ways to see knowledge production or good research. How does empire influence these usual subjects? These dominant figures. Who's the lead researcher? Great man theory around the classics, the canon. Who is outside of that.

We've got good examples that *are* evidencing, also brought in Bhambra, and that is another side. They really talk about the knowledge production side. At the level of the university, and the knowledge of such, we can see this influenced by empire. Then, we can give examples to that.

How would that change our argument? Hill Cohlins - epistemologies of black women from pre-slave times.

What kind of visions do we need? Working connected sociologies, knowledge born out of struggle and dominant power relations. All of these things are important. Look at present day inequalities. What do we need to critique about the things we explore to find out new identities? What does that mean?

That is what we should look at the argument to avoid summarising what we do. The subtler examples tend to have more traction in terms of our argument, and we can basically say: it's not just the bodies that are excluded, it's also that the knowledge making exercises are grounded in this relations, on account of inequality itself has limits. We start to see how the concepts might not help us respond. Inequality isn't by any stretch of the imagination in decline. You can see more or less transformations in the recognition of certain things. But if we see Roe Vs Wade, the removal of that landmark legislation being withdrawn from that, what can be obvious to the colonial proximity in that ideal? Especially with minoritized women in that context of violence and abuse. Not having control over one's body. The real question is what do we need to do? What theories of inequality may have to live somewhere else? Born out of struggle, or sense. Even thinking about tricky concepts - pointing out the canon. Street academy - institutions run by people who don't believe we should have borders. David Graeber. He worked with Kurdish freedom fighters, who was behind 99% occupying it. Wall street side of the thing in the US. We don't want to use sovereign power to govern our notion of equality or inequality, we want other forms. We want another term - democratic federalism. Not the idea that we will teach nation building, we are going to do something different. Especially when those sovereign powers are more homogeneous.

What kind of other spaces? What can we get in there? A slightly different way of thinking about what we can do if we're this close to coloniality, in the knowledge making project. That's what the conclusion - what unique ideas can we bring in?


Necropolitics - Achilie Mbembe (Foucault's notion of the idea of sovereign governments and strategies are really about population management that gets taken out) - the idea of the camp
Paul Gilroy - Between Camps
Judith Butler - not race, but tackles that in Frames of War: Grievable Lies
Hartman - Seams of Subjection
