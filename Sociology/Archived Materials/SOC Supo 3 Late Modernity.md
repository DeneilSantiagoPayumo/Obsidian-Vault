What theorists are able to comprehend this:
"In this essay I want to argue (in two parts)" - it is widely accepted that accelerating change through modernity is transforming what it means to be human.

Baudrillard: to say, the scholar Baudrillard helps us understand this, drawing on structural post-continental theory helps us comprehend this anxiety and acceleration.

Put concepts really up front and centre. "Baudrillard helps us comprehend this change, transforming how we see reality"

Define his key terms, "however, there are limitations"

Open up the argument in two parts: not just the experience of emotions, but who helps us comprehend it (for example, Baudrillard helps us unpack this accelerating change in relation to modernity, transformations associated with it and this concept of the simulacrum, spectacularising of society through these various cultural venues)

After that, "I also recognise its limitations"

Combine it in one paragraph. Hannah Arendt, Ulrich Beck, so on... Be incredibly precise. Should I be the person making the argument, (Baudrillard can make some account of how this acceleration)

Instead of questions "here, in this context", make it more situated and contingent, make somethings that allows us to comprehend it. "Depending on the degree to which culture is heavily influenced by Baudrillard's simulacrum that makes one sense of reality disingenuous and undermined, the psycho-social dimension of that can be profound."

What is media doing, what is it trying to convince us what is real or not. (Perhaps a safer strategy) to be focusing that seem ridiculous that media outlets share. Think of Tucker Carlson, using conservative slant to shore up power on the populist right, trying to develop culture wars. This is exactly what Baudrillard is talking about: this sense of the real is transforming because authorities are being given authority to lie.

Put together outlandish examples. Could also argue, bring in Stuart Hall on **conjectural moments** - this idea that questions around truth, public trust, trust around public institutions - points to Baudrillard's effectiveness in helping us understand this hyper-reality.

Substantiate our argument with many other post-modern theorist. Foucault - biotechnology. We're in a nice place there, consolidated, made parallel arguments and examples. Let's see! How far can we go with Baudrillard's argument in understanding acceleration.

Try not to put together too many arguments! If Baudrillard's not enough, who can help us.

Perhaps Baudrillard has overdetermined this idea that somehow the simulacrum is too powerful and people are agents in deconstructing the work that they're doing. Ritzer (agency, mechanisms for this kind of existential crisis of meaninglessness), even the concept of the existential crisis could be, how does this simulacrum undermine meaninglessness. 

Unpack, redirect criticism towards Baudrillard using frames of reference that says "if that's missing, what can we think about it." Her sense is that when I bring in Reckwitz, he is giving us an alternative perspective (this is also a problem, which is fine) but we need to be cohesive about it.

Might (might?) be wise to put one of those two thinkers to challenge Baudrillard, or to help again narrow the case. Look at one of the thinkers is more convincing, rather than trying to make a huge argument, use Ritzer to nuance the limitations of Baudrillard's arguments (especially if it's more convincing), a coherent way of moving from one section of the argument to another. I am broadly agreeing but have other critiques to understand the overdetermined ways of living everyday life. And, this is how it's done.

Distinction and nothing, how do they help us understand the psychology of acceleration. Baudrillard - unavoidable! Others telling us what this actually looks like in practice, Baudrillard is not working at that level. Giving this case of Linda. More challenge about Baudrillard, in a way that Baudrillard cannot account for.

Want it all to fit together and have a coherent link between each one, having too many in there might find it hard to narrate the argument.

Reflection on Baudrillard's argument that we can begin to see the ways in which we may have fears, anxiety and stresses, and the production of meaningless through culture itself. I am saying that but I need to develop it. What authors?

Refer back to Baudrillard (think of spider instead of chain!)

Still deal with the question of acceleration, have we questioned Baudrillard in relationship to cultures of whiteness, or the realm of what is the spectacular (what does Disney do, what work is it doing in creating certain legitimacies), why would their work help us comprehend Baudrillard's conceptions... But we need to trigger that earlier on. Is the Simulacrum a culture of whiteness and European modernity. What about race and the concept of reality?

List the essay I've done, and make a concept map of all the people (gender and sexuality), if we know our critics well enough, we can confront that in a question we're surprised by, make sure we're comfortable and banking on a couple of questions that we do in a note form to be on the safe side

Make sure in our revision time we are looking towards the entire course, ensure that we have banked on a couple of essays in a less sophisticated form that we have revised for.

Make a concept map: April 2nd today, next week we will be here for all of next week, towards the end of next week (concept map)

12th - concept map, send it on 13th and we can have a supervision on the Monday, 4PM (concept mapping), and then we'll get an essay on the Saturday and we will have a supervision over a revision essay you've done.

13th - concept mapping of an essay, send it on Saturday night, worst case scenario if I'm under a lot of stress, make track changes
