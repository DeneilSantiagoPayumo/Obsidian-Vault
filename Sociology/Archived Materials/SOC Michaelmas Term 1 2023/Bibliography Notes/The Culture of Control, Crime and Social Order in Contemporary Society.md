# Chapter 2: Modern Criminal Justice and the Penal Welfare State

## Abstract:

```ad-abstract
This chapter describes the penal-welfare structure, formed by combining the liberal legalism of due process and proportionate punishment with a correctionalist commitment to rehabilitation, welfare, and criminological expertise. By the 1960s, in both the USA and the UK, penal-welfarism commanded the assent, or at least the compliance, of all the key groups involved in criminal justice — and the enthusiastic support of government department administrators, social work professionals, and liberal elites. The idea of ‘progress in penal reform’ was a conventional idea, and an intelligible one, because it captured the sense of the gradual implementation of a progressive programme that was widely shared and highly respected. These penal-welfare arrangements were also part of the wider scheme of things. Their basic structure and functioning were rooted in the differentiated institutional arrangements of modern society, and their programmes and working ideologies were integral elements of the post-war welfare state and its social democratic politics.

```ad-quote
"The result was a hybrid, 'penal-welfare' structure, combining the liberal legalism of due process and proportionate punishment with a correctionalist commitment to rehabilitation, welfare and criminological expertise. By 1970 the basic contours of this penal-welfare style were well established and appeared to be a settled dynamic of progressive change moving in an increasingly correctionalist direction." (27)
```

### Key Ideas (in chapters):
#### Penal modernity: the emergence of a criminal justice state:

```ad-quote
"The foundations of twentieth-century crime control were laid centuries before when our now-familiar criminal justice institutions first emerged as integral elements of the long-term process that produced the modern nation-state." (29)
```

He attributes this to the 'contested' and 'unstable' authority of sovereign lords to impose peace. law enforcement was a matter of lordship and political rule where the king's sovereign will was imposed against rebellious subjects. Later, it meant the punishment of criminals.

"With the expansion of democracy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this sovereign was transformed into a 'public' power. Its claw came to hold itself out as 'the will of the people' and their representatives ... concentrating them [control of policing] in the new institutions of criminal justice ..." (30)

These historical processes of differentiation, statization, bureaucratization, and professionalization are the key characteristics of what we might term the 'modernization' of crime control and criminal justice.

#### The problem of order and the path not taken

```ad-quote
"In liberal democreacies, the state's capacity to impose 'law and order' came to be viewed not as a hostile and threatening power but as a contractual obligation owed by a democratic government to its law-abiding citizens. This guarantee of law and order, of security ... became one of the key puiblic benefits conferred upon the people by the state and its agencies." (30-31)
```

Garland points out several features:

The chief method of controlling crime in specialist state was the pursuit, prosecution, and punishment of individual offenders, modern societies turned away from an alternative model of regulation.

"The aim of this kind of 'police' regulation was to promote public tranquillity and security, to ensure efficient trade and communications in the city, and to enhance the wealth, health and prosperity of the population ... city authorities promulgated detailed by-laws calling for the inspections of weights and measures, censuses of the population, programmes of street lighting, the regulation of roads and buildings, trade and foodstuffs, even going so far as to specify the appropriate manners and modes of dress of citizens." (31)

Patrick Colquhoun's proposal wants to conserve policing practices and strengthen and rationalize them -  adapting them to the challenges of commercial capitalism. This created a preventative form of regulation ... involving the identification and pursuit of criminal offenders.

Here, crime was assumed to a normal succumbing to temptation. ... the response was to focus on the prevention of criminal opportunities and the policing of vulnerable situations.

In reality, Colquhoun's proposal was displaced by the emergence of a specialist state system. The development of criminal justice was part of a broad process of modernization that has seen the development of structural differentiation, was viewed with suspicion by liberals because of its associations with the absolutist regimes of continental Europe.

"The public police evolved from being a state instrument, protecting the interests of the state and a propertied elite, to being a more authentically public service, responding to individual citizen complaints, and, in theory at least, providing security and protection to the whole population ... the presence of professionals tended to de-skill the people and to relieve them of the sense that crime control was their responsibility" (32)

That said, we can also attribute much of this achievement to the resilience of social controls in working-class communities, the impact of religious revivals, moral campaigns of churches and reform organisations, conduct and more that helped deter crime rates.

It's likely thus that the success of the prisons was dependent on other forces.

"The established formula of the modern criminal state ... assumed that crime control must be a specialist, professional task of 'law enforcement' orientated to ... the processing of individual offenders."

#### Penal welfarism and the correctionalist crime control

Penal-welfarism was the established policy framework in both Britain and America by 1970s. 

```ad-quote
"It's basic axioms - that penal measures ought ... to be rehabilitative interventions rather than negative, retributive punishments - gave to rise to a whole new network of interlocking principles and practices ... including sentencing laws that allowed indeterminite sentences ... the juvenile court ... the use of social inquiry ... the individualization of treatment based on expert assessment ... re-integrative support..." (34)
```

These principles worked against imprisonment as prisons were regarded as counter-productive from the view of reform and individual correction. In this framework, the rehabilitative ideal was a hegemonic, organizing principle, the intellectual framework and value system that bound the whole structure and made sense of it for practitioners. It provided an all-embracing conceptual net that could be cast over each and evey activity in the penal field (35).

Rehabilitation was not the typical outcome. The discretionary nature of correctionalist arrangements gave system decision'-makers extensive latitude in their treatment: 'bad' offenders could be detained, those with respectable backgrounds could be let off, penal measures were adjusted.

With this in mind, with a gap between announced prison sentences and actual time meant a difference between 'bark' and 'bite' - not scrutinized too correctly, it could avoid public criticism. It was intensely flexible.

For the British government, the decisions of sentencing, classifying inmates was placed in the hands of penal experts rather than judicial authorities. This discretionary power was given to unaccountable professionals ... decisions issued without explanation. (36)

Commitment was variable:
- In judges' chambers there were daily tussles between prosecutors and probation officers: the one arguing for a prison sentence, the other for non-custodial alternatives; one pressing the moral discourse of law with its stress on agency... 
- Positions were invoked in political ideologies. Liberals believed that treatment was better than punishment whereas conservatives spoke of the need of capital punishment, letting the police get on with their job. The disagreement was the right balance, not about the range of considerations.

In practice, penal-welfarism shaped the habits of practitioners and policy makers. "Itt was the field's overall character that ... gave rise to an institutionalized ontology that dictates how it could be known ... shaping the spectrum of penal politics, determining what was progressive and reactionary." (38)

It had two axioms - the first was that social reform together with affluence would eventually reduce the frequency of crime, and that the state is responsible for the care of offenders as well as their punishment and control.

There was a frustration: if crime is a social problem, individualistic approaches will not work and will only intervene after the damage is done.


#### The commitments of modernism 

What made correctionalist modernist was its commitment to social engineering, its confidence in the capacities of the state and the possibilities of science and its unswerving belief that social conditions and individual offenders could be reformed by the intervention of government agencies.

"Punishment in general, retributive punishments in particular, were viewed by the modernists as irrational and counter-productive, as remnants of pre-modern practices based upon emotion, instinct and superstition." (40)

There was resistance on modernist movement from liberals who insisted on 'just deserts' and saw punishment as a necessary end in itself.

As penal-welfarism was expressed, explicit expressions of punitiveness became rare. They were repressed, forced underground, found to be embarrassing. There became a basis of a cultural rift between criminal justice professionals and members of the general public.

#### Correctionalist criminology and its central themes

A range of points:
- Correctionalist criminology ... perceived crime as a social problem that manifested in the form of individual, criminal acts. (41)

The purpose of correctionalist criminology:
- A routine differentiation between 'the normal' and 'the pathological' followed by a focus on the latter. Offending Individuals who were free of any real criminal disposition became uninteresting, only attacked minimally.
- The real focus of attention was on the delinquent and criminal character.
- There was a bias towards a form of causality that was long-term, dispositional and operated through the formation of personality traits and attitude, assuming that surface meanings are superficial.
- They wanted to identify the characteristics that differentiated delinquents and criminal personalities, correlating these with other conditions that provide clues to their treatment.
- A secondary concern was to study and evaluate the impact of the various penal-welfare interventions: to ascertain 'what works' and why. This kind of research ensured that crime control institutions had monitoring and reflexivity that provided feedback on the institutions effects and from which to measure their results.

What was noticeable about modernism was its:
```ad-quote
"relative absence of any substantive interest in crime events, criminogenic situations, victim behaviour, or the social and economic routines that produce criminal opportunities ... [it assumed] the efficacy of criminal justice and the possibility of an individualized mode of crime reduction ... directed our attention to these individual ... hid from view other ways of conceiving and acting upon the problem ... it assumed without question the possibility and desirability of reintegrating delinquents and deviant individuals. It looked to social work and social reform, professional treatment and public provision to bring this about." (44)
```

#### Social context context and institutional supports
```ad-quote
Penal-welfarism addressed itself to problems of individual maladjustment that were heavily concentrated among the poorer sections of the population, and which it attributed to poverty, poor socialization and social deprivation ... the classic pathologies of industrailized, inegalitarian, class society ... leading to the development of 'the social state' in the early years of the century." (45)
```

The British welfare state and its American counterpart the New Deal regulatory state created a series of strategic solutions: regulatory law, Keynesian policies, social engineering and more. Through enhanced security and more, post-war governments in both countries tempered the risks of market capitalism.

Once this was done, this dominant ideology was a moderately solidaristic one that claimed to bring all individuals into full social citizenship with equal rights and equal opportunities. These idealistic aspects appealed to the memories of the Depression and total war, the guilty consciences of upper class elites and more.

#### Penal-welfare and 'social' regulation

The development of new strategies of governance created a new way of exercising power - keeping with that of the welfare state as a whole. A whole series of problems came to be conceived of as social problems with social causes to be dealt with by means of social techniques and social work professionals, empowering expert authorities to establish social norms and standards in areas of life that were not formally regulated: child-rearing, health care, moral education.

```ad-quote
The welfare state thus accelerated the move towards a 'professional society' that was already well underway during the nineteenth century. It gave rise to a new strata of professional workers who staffed the welfare state and the expanding public sector, ministering to the needs of citizens in an increasingly affluent, consumer economy. Social work became a growth industry... (47)


```

#### The social basis of penal-welfarism

The welfare state and post-war prosperity enhanced economic security and social solidarity in Britain and America ... in this historical context, crime and delinquency could be viewed ... as lingering relic of previously deprivations. And penal-welfare agencies could alleviate this by extending help and treatment to the unfortunate individuals. (48)

As crime rates increased, so did the effort to develop a correctionalist strategy in response: economic expansion and improved standards of living, relaxing the threshold of 'less eligibility' and making public funds more available.

For the **style of governance**, these institutions were associated with a social democratic form of politics and narrative of inclusion, drawing power from class relations and collective memories, embodying a style of 'social' governance that relied upon forms of social expertise, embodying the combination of humanitarian and utilitarian motivations.

For the **capacity for social control**, the penal welfare state depended on social control exerted by families, neighbours and communities imposed by schools, creating an everyday environment of norms and sanctions that underpinned the law's demands and provided support for penal-welfare interventions.

For the **economic context**, it was developed against a background of economic conditions - sustained economic growth, improved standards of living enjoyed by the mass of working people and experience of full employment delivered by Keynesian demand management.

It also had huge **support by social elites** for the 'ethos' of penal-welfarism, an approach to a 'rational', 'detached', 'civilized' approach to offenders.

They depended on **perceived validity** where a plausible narrative was needed to explain these failures.

There was also an **absence of any active public or political opposition** from the general public who were excited in punitive measures.

# Chapter 8: Crime Control and Social Order

## Abstract

```ad-abstract
The crime control landscape that has emerged in America and Britain at the end of the 20th century has surprised experts and defied historical predictions. This chapter argues that one can best understand these developments — in policing, sentencing, punishment, penal philosophy, penal politics, private security, crime prevention, criminological theory, the treatment of victims, and so on — by regarding them as interrelated aspects of a social field that is itself being restructured. The book has described how the new crime control developments have ‘adapted’ and ‘responded’ to the late modern world, and to its political and cultural values. But these developments also, in their turn, play a role in _creating_ that world, helping to constitute the meaning of late modernity. The book also argues that today's crime control strategies have certain congruence, a certain ‘fit’ with the structures of late modern society. They represent a particular kind of response, a particular adaptation, to the specific problems of social order produced by late modern social organization.
```

## Key Ideas

### What spawned our current world of crime control and criminal justice?

```ad-quote
[Crime control and criminal justice] was created by a series of adaptive responses to the cultural and criminological conditions of late modernity - conditions which includeed new problems of crime and insecurity, and new attitudes towards the welfare state. (193) 
```

We had to adapt our practices of controlling crime and doing justice to:
	"an increasingly insecure economy that marginalizes substantial sections of the population; to a hedonistic consumer culture that combines extensive personal freedoms with relaxed social controls; to a pluralistic moral order that struggles to create trust relations between strangers who have little in common; to a 'sovereign' state that is increasingly incapable of regulating a society of individuated citizens and differentiated social groups; and to chronically high crime rates that co-exist with low levels of family cohesion and community solidarity. (194)

In reality, the insecure character of socioeconomic relations is the social surface that gives rise to our newly emphatic, overreaching concern ... background circumstance that prompts our obsessive attempts to monitor risky individuals, to isolate dangerous populations.

Our culture, in Britain and America specifically, there is a theme of security, orderliness and control. Our civic culture, due to these regimes of regulation, inspection and control, becomes less tolerant and inclusive, increasingly less capable of trust. Our intensive regulation and control emphasizes control in every area of social life, with the exception of the economy.

This spawned from a theme of historical accumulated change - decades of economic changes (1950s, 60s, 70s) that gave way to a wave of anxiety about the breakdown of the family, relaxation of institutional disciplines, and the collapse of informal norms of restraint.

```ad-quote
A reactionary politics have used this underlying disquiet to create a powerful narrative of moral decline in which crime has come to feature - together with teenage pregnancies, single parent families, welfare dependency, and drug abuse - as the chief sympton of the supposed malaise." (195)


```

This has led to an imposition of new disciplines and controls, and there has been no way of returning to a world in which individuals are hemmed in the communal controls of local belonging, steady work and tight-knit family.

```ad-quote
Unwilling to pay more taxes or finance the security of others ... the anxious middle classes today seek resolution for their ambivalence in zealously controlling the poor and excluding the marginal. Above all, they impose controls upon 'dangerous' offenders and 'underserving' claimants whose conducts lead to suppose that they are incapable of discharging the responsibilities of the late modern freedom. (195)
```

### Punishment of late modernity

New effects can be seen in the treatment of the poor - they are seen as underserving and treated accordingly, viewed as a lack of effort, their feckless choices, their distinctive culture and chosen conduct.

Rational choice theory has come to organise the politics of poverty, these premises transforming criminal justice evident in 'welfare reform.'

```ad-quote
Like the system of criminal justice, the benefits structure of the welfare state has come to be viewed as a generator of problems and pathologies rather than a cure for them. Reform efforts focus upon reducing costs, strengthening disincentives, surrounding benefit payments with controls and restrictions, and 'getting people off welfare'. Less effort is directed to addressing the structural sources of unemployment, poverty, and ill-health. (197)
```

This has lead to more controls imposed on the poor while fewer controls affect the market freedoms of the rest. Tax cuts on upper income groups have lead to those in well-paid work have enjoyed increased living standards, enhanced consumer freedom and fewer state control.

The consequence: the middle class views state welfare as not working to their benefits, seen as a costly and inefficient government bureaucracy redistributing hard-earned income. Large sections of middle and working classes see themselves victimized by the poor.

```ad-quote
Offenders must be deemed to be free, to be rational, to be exercising choice, because that is how we muist conceive of ourselves. "Crime is a decision not a disease." is the new conventional wisdom ... care is taken to be a freely chosen act, a rational decision ... if individuals are deemed irresponsible ... then there must be forces that do not act upon the rest of us - causes of our own actions and choices. (199)

```

Today welfare state institutions still play a supporting role in economic and social life, but the solidarity project has been replaced by imperatives of security, economy, an d control - crime control and criminal justice have come to be disconnected from the broader themes of social justice.

### The social roots of crime control

Why has the prison moved from being a discredited institution destined for abolition to become an expanded and seemingly indispensable pillar of late modern life?

Imprisonment serves a function: "the need for a 'civilized' and 'constitutional' means of segregating the problem populations created by today's economic and social arrangements ... it punishes and protects, condemns and controls ... an expressive satisfaction of retributive sentiments and an instrumental mechanism for the management of risk and confinement of dangers." (199)

**Why do governments turn to penal solutions to deal with marginal populations (typically young urban minority males)?**

They are immediate, easy to implement, and claim to 'work' as a punitive end in themselves. They rely on existing systems of regulation and allow condemnation to be forced on low-status outcasts.

These elite groups are aware of the social and racial divisions that characterize today's society and use defensive space to ward off outsiders, and also that problems of personal security, crime prevention and penal provisions create commercial opportunities.

Thus, we have moved to situational crime prevention - implementation proceeding outside of a politics of solidarity, not benefiting the undeserving poor, implying a social critique or disturb market appeal. It appeals through distributing it through the market as commodities, adapting itself to demand.

The image of the suffering victim - direct identification with a victim, moral outrage increases:
	"A declining faith in public institutions now means that only the sight of suffering 'individuals like us' can be relied upon to provoke the impassioned responses needed to supply the emotional energy for punitive policies and a war upon crime." (200-201)


---

There are two accounts here: a structural account that points to the general characteristics of a kind of social organization, and a conjunctural account that identifies the choices and contingencies that shaped how social groups adapted to these structures and mediated their social consequences.

##### Prophecies of the future
```ad-quote
As the market in private security expands, the delivery of penal legislation speeds up, and the crime complex reproduces itself, we face the possibility of being locked into a new 'iron cage.' ... such arrangements spawn institutional investments and produce definite benefits, particularly for the social groups who are at the greatest adistance from them ... entailing a way of allocating the costs of crime ... (203-204)
```

Other consequences: hardening of social and racial divisions, reinforcement of criminogenic processes, alienation of social groups and more. Over time, it is probable that its conflicts with the ideals of liberal democracy is apparent ... focused on racial minorities. 

The fundamental lesson: the problem of crime control has demonstrated the limits of sovereign state ... "the state is seriously limited in its capacity to provide security for its citizens and deliver adequate levels of social control ... the nation state cannot any longer hope to govern by means of sovereign commands issued to obedient subjects ... legitimate government must devolve power and share the work of social control with local organizations and communities." (205)
