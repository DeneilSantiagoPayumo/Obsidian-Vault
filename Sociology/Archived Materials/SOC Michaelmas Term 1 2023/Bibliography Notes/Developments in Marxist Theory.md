## Marxist Approaches to Power

There are three Marxist approaches to the state: instrumentalist, structuralist and strategic-relational.

Instrumentalist see the state as a neutral tool for exercising political power - whichever class controls this tool can use it to advance their own interest.
Structuralists argue that who controls the state is irrelevant because it has a bias towards capital. Strategic-relational theorists argue that state power is a condensation of the balance of class forces in struggle.

Instrumentalists regard the contemporary state as a state in capitalist society - [[Ralph Miliband]] views the ruling class as one that can own and control the means of production which is able to use the state as an instrument for the domination of society.

The state, for them, has no inherently capitalist form and performs no capitalist functions. Any functions it does perform occur because pro-capitalist forces happen to control the state and securing social order also happens to secure key conditions for rational economic calculations.

Structuralists regard the state as a capitalist state as it has an inherent capitalist form and functions on behalf of capital. Structuralists argue that the very structure of the modern state means that it organizes capital and disorganizes the working class. [[Claus Offe]] views that the state's exclusion from direct control over the means of production means that its revenues depend on the private sector, so therefore they must ensure the profitability of capital. The typical form of Bourgeois state is a constitutional state and later a national-popular democratic state.

The strategic-relational approach argues that the state is a social relation - the modern state has inbuilt biases but these are insufficient in themselves in ensuring capitalist rule. They served to reproduce class conflict and the contradictions within the state itself so that the impact of state power depended on the changing balance of forces and the strategies and tactics pursued by class and non-class forces alike.

The state by no means is class-neutral. It is class-biased by virtue of the structural selectivity that makes state institutions, capacities and resources more accessible to some political forces and more tractable for some purposes than others.

This bias varies with the institutional matrix - the capitalist state, since it is not a subject, does not and cannot exercise power. Its power instead are activated through changing set of politicians and state officials located in specific parts of the state apparatus in specific conjunctures. If this line is ever discernible, it results from strategic coordination enabled by the selectivity of the state system and the organisational role of parallel power networks that cross-cut and unify its formal structures.

It follows that the political class struggle never ends. Only through its continual renewal can a capitalist power bloc keep its relative unity in the face of rivalry and factionalism and maintain its hegemony over subaltern groups. Only by disrupting the state's strategic selectivity through mass struggle can a democratic transition to democratic socialism be achieved.


### Ideological Class Domination

[[Karl Marx]] stated that "the ruling ideas of any age are the ideas of the ruling class" and related this to the latter's control over the means of intellectual production.

[[Gramsci]] developed a distinctive approach to the analysis of class power - he wanted to develop an autonomous Marxist science of politics in capitalist societies to distinguish different types of states and politics, establishing the conditions under which revolutionary forces might replace capitalism.

He identified the state with the politico-juridical apparatus, the constitutional and institutional features of government, its formal decision-making procedures and its general policies. His studies focused on the means and ways through which *political, intellectual and moral leadership* was mediated through a complex ensemble of institutions, organizations and forces operating within or away from the state in a narrow sense.

He defines the state as political society plus civil society, and claims that state power in Western capitalist societies rest on 'hegemony armoured by coercion'. He argues that states are based on force and hegemony - hegemony involving the successful mobilization and reproduction of the active consent of dominated groups by the ruling class through the exercise of political, intellectual and moral leadership. He argued that the capitalist state should be seen as an institutional ensemble based on coercion, consent, fraud and corruption.

His argument is that advanced capitalist democracies will engage in a long-term war of position in which subordinate class forces develop a hegemonic 'collective will' that creatively synthesizes a revolutionary project based on the everyday experiences and common sense of popular forces.

### The Articulation of Economic, Political and Ideological Domination

Particular forms of state privilege some strategies over others, some time horizons over others, some coalition possibilities over others.

Gramsci argues that there was a reciprocal relationship between the economic 'base' and politico-ideological 'superstructure' - he studied this in terms of how the necessary reciprocity between structure and superstructure is secured through specific moral, intellectual and political practices that translate narrow interests into broader ones. Only thus does the economic structure cease to be an external constraining force and become a source of initiative and subjective freedom.

These ethico-political practices give them their overall rationale and legitimacy.

Gramsci spoke of a 'historical bloc', also introducing the concepts of 'power bloc' and 'hegemonic bloc' to analyse the alliances among dominant classes and the ensemble of national-popular forces that were mobilized behind a specific hegemonic project.

Hegemonic bloc refers to social forces. It is a durable alliance of class forces organized by a class that has proved itself capable of exercising political, intellectual and moral leadership over the dominant classes and popular masses alike - organic intellectuals, people that can develop hegemonic projects that give a 'national-popular' expression to the long-term interests of the dominant. Relatively durable hegemony depended on a 'decisive economic nucleus'.

### Spatio-Temporal Moments of Domination

Time and space are closely related and have both structural aspects (different temporalities) and strategic aspects (specific temporal horizons of actions).

The inner determinations of capital accumulation entail specific ways of organizing time - time is money. Marx invented labour time, surplus value, relative surplus value, and shows the concrete temporalities of the processes connected to the constant rebasing of abstract labour time as the driving force behind the never-ending treadmill of competition from which neither capital nor workers can escape from.

In short, the temporalities of accumulation are crucial aspects of the organization of economic domination and fundamentally affect political and socio-cultural relations, penetrating deeply into everyday life.

They affect forms of political domination - its temporal sovereignty is challenged by the acceleration of time. The state has less time to determine and coordinate political responses to shocks and crises - one solution to the state's loss of time sovereignty is a laisses-faire response that frees up the movement of superfast capital.

There are two other options: either compressing their own decision-making so that they can make interventions or decelerate the activities of fast capitalism.

Temporal compression - decisions on the basis of unreliable information, insufficient consultation, lack of participation. This resort is reflected in the shortening of policy development cycles, fast-tracking decision making, rapid programme rollout.

Fast policy is antagonistic to corporatism, stake holding, the rule of law, formal bureaucracy and such - it privileges the executive over the legislature and the judiciary, finance over industrial capital, consumption over long-term investments. It undermines the power of decision makers.

An alternative strategy is to create pockets of relative time by slowing the circuits of capital - the Tobin tax, a tax on financial transactions. This would decelerate the flow of capital and limits its impact on the real economy. Another field of struggle is climate change - continuing conflicts between national states about the speed and nature of the response along with well-funded opposition form firms and sectors There is a strong class aspect to the creation of environmental struggles.

Also, they develop in the context of a world market that lacks a world state or effective global governance - this undermines state capacities to steer the economy, cope with its crisis tendencies and address its effects on inequalities, generating instability as enterprise exploit global market opportunities without a regard to their environmental, political and social consequences - a shift from government to governance, the increased role of networks and partnerships and so on.

### Conclusions

Marxist themes
- Power and class domination
- Mediations among economic, political and ideological class domination
- The limitations and contradictions of power grounded in the nature of capitalism
- The role of strategy and tactics.

Some weaknesses:
- It marginalizes other forms of social domination - patriarchal, ethnic, racial, hegemonic masculinities 
- They exaggerate the structural coherence of class domination, neglecting its disjuncture, contradictions and so on.
- Third, they risk reducing the limits of economic, political and other ideological power to the effect of class contradiction, missing other sources of failure
- An emphasis on strategy and tactics is important to avoid the structuralist fallacy, but there is a risk of voluntarism if strategy and tactics are examined without conflict.
