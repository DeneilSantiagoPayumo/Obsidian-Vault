## A summary of the book:

This essay written by Paul Gilroy discusses the power of the ideology surrounding black criminality.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### State ideology

```ad-quote
The rule of law and maintenance of public order have appeared in forms which involve a racist appeal to the 'British Nation' and have become integral to maintaining popular support for the government in crisis conditions. (47)
```

Images of crime and law-breaking has an ideological importance - 'crime' can have political implications which extend beyond the political consciousness of criminals (47).

```ad-quote
The disorder of imagery of crime and criminals is now an expression of national decline - at best, "a lingering environmentalism makes a causal link between crime and unemployment or the deterioration of the inner-cities. At worst, discussion of crime becomes subsumed by the idea that the rule of law and therefore the Nation itself is somehow under attack." (48)
```

The imagery of alien violence and criminality is an important instrument in the hands of politicians and police officers whose authority is undermined by the political fluctuation of the crisis.

A critique: left-wing writers have tended to ignore the well-documented abuse of the black communities by the police which stretches back to the beginnings of post-war settlement in sufficient volume to have made a considerable impact on their critical view of the police.

If policing by consent is the fundamental principle of the British approach, crisis conditions dictate that policemen have ceased to pay lip service to this idea [that police are seen as brothers], recognising that consent must be won through intervention.

### Popular Politics of Law and Order (and failings thereof)

```ad-quote
These fears [are] themselves produced by a novel situation in which the police have begun to derive their ideological authority from a direct relationship to the people, and their political legitimacy from an increasingly unacceptable voice in matters of social policy, this fear is taken as an unproblematic reflection of the reality of crime in working class communities. (50)
```

Thus, the public must be re-educated in more realistic expectations of the police.

There is evidence to suggest that the police in Devon and Cornwall are capable of the excesses of 'fire-brigade' policing as their brother officers in Manchester, making nonsense of the view of community policing as a miraculous cure-all for urban ailments and the symptoms of economic crisis.

The left's failings in relation to law, police and crime go beyond poor analysis -  [[John Lea]] and [[Jock Young]] have argued that the source of the summer riots (1981) lay in the political marginalisation of inner-city communities, ignoring the policy/community relations and viewing West Indian Life as characterised by pathological family relations.

Presenting black crime as a cultural problem formed is a capitulation to the weight of racist logic.

The emphasis on black culture legitimates the idea that all blacks are contaminated by the alien predisposition to crime which is reproduced in their distinctive cultures. 52

Lea and Young want to institute consensual policing where the policeman is in and with the community - but this is not accurate, as they present the militarisation of inner-city policing as a straightforward, if undesirable, response to rising levels of 'street crime' in inner areas.

Their political solution is built on consensual policing - a situation in which the policeman is in and with the community, that it has existed in the past - they view the police officer as a friendly figure.

Some examples:
1. Situation in London where forty incidents 'carrying the potential for large scale disorder' had developed out of police attempts to arrest black youths ... tracing this pattern back to the early 1970s
2. The combined weight of these 'isolated incidents' is sufficient to transform the picture presented by Young and Lea ... the systematic application of militaristic and reactive policing to black areas ... black streets have never enjoyed the benefits of this police policy ... the systematic application of militaristic and reactive policing to black areas the length and breadth of Britain undermines any view of consensual policing ... policing theory informs them and legitimates the view of blacks as disproportionately prone to criminality. 54

The central argument here is that the question of black crime must be approached in a  historical fashion, and in a context supplied by the overall pattern of police/community conflict in conditions of deepening crisis ... there is strong evidence to suggest that emphasis on particular crimes can engineer what appear to be a crime waves of these police, not only because of heightened public sensitivity to these crimes, but also as a result of changes in police practice. It is certainly plausible that 'mugging' has constituted a self-fulfilling prophecy of this time. (55)

We should also consider that the official surveys of the victims of crime have returned findings which are at odds with the fact that crime itself rises when crime rates are soaring.

"Young, Lea and Taylor, though they are correct to emphasise that the flow of information from communities is the main source of police knowledge, balance this by the idea that in exchange for the information the police will prevent crime. They are particularly concerned with everyday forms in which it is experienced by working class communities." (56)

"Scrutiny of the history of policing in Britain, particularly its cities, suggests that everyday crimes in which the working class are the victims have never been of major concern to police, and secondly, the proliferation of private security firms ... suggests that the police may not even have been very successful in protecting the policy of the bourgeoisie."
