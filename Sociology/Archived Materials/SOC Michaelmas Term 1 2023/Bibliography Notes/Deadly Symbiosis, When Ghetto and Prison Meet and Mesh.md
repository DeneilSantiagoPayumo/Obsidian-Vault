```ad-abstract
To explain the astounding over-representation of blacks behind bars that has driven mass imprisonment in the US, one must break out of the 'crime-and-puinishment' paradigm to reckon the extra-penelogical function of the criminal justice system as instrument for the management of dispossessed and dishonored groups. This article places the prison in th e historical sequence of 'peculiar institutions' that have shouldered the task of defining and confining African Americans, alongside slavery, the Jim Crow regime, and the ghettto. The recent upsurge in black incarceration results fr om the crisis of the ghetto as device for caste control and the correlative need for a substitute apparatus for the containment of lower-class African Americans. In the post-Civil Rights era, the vestiges of the dark ghetoo and the expanding prison system have become linked by a triple relationship of functional equivalency, structural homology, and cultural fusion, spawning a carceral continuum that entraps a population of younger black men rejected by the deregulated wage-labour market. This carceral mesh has been solidified by changes that have reshaped the urban 'Black Belt' of mid-century as to *make the ghetto more like a prison*. The resulting symbiosis between ghetto and prison not only prepetuates the socioeconomic marginality and symbolic taint of the black subproletariat, feeding the runaway growth of the carceral system. It also plays a piuotal role in the remaking of 'race', the redefinition of the citizenry via the production of a racialized public culture of villification of criminals, and the construction of a post-Keynesian state that replaces the social-welfare of poverty by its penal management.

##  A collection of central ideas:

### The historical sequence of 'peculiar institutions'

#### Four peculiar institutions

There are four peculiar institutions that have enforced the peculiar [[W, E. B. Du Bois|'colour line']]: slavery, the Jim Crow system, the urban ghetto, and the novel organizational compound formed by the vestiges of the ghetto and the expanding carceral system:

Society has guaranteed that each peculiar institution would in time be undermined by the weight of its internal contradictions as well as mounting black resistance and external opposition to be replaced by its next regime. At each stage, the apparatus becomes less capable of encompassing all segments - not 'separate and unequal' like before but "differentiated and diffuse, allowing a burgeoning middle and upper class of professionals and salary earners to partially compensate for the negative symbolic capital of blackness by their high-status cultural capital and proximity to centres of political power, while lower-class blacks remained burdened by the triple stigma of 'race', poverty and putative immorality" (99)

##### Slavery: (1619-1865)

A relation of domination and not category of legal thought
Violence channelled for an economic appetite for labour
Increase in life expectancy, the growth of tobacco trade, the need to encourage further voluntary immigration and the relative powerlessness of African captives compared to others made slaves the preferred source of labour.
Slavery as a system of unfree labour thus spawned a suffusive racial culture which in turn remade bondage into something tit was not at its outset: a colour-coded institution of ethnoracial division (100)

##### Jim Crow (South, 1865-1965)

Emancipation eliminated the cheap and abundant workforce needed to run the plantation economy.
Under this regime, "super-exploitative sharecropping arrangements and debt peonage fixed black labour on the land, perpetuating the hegemony of the region's agararian upper class..." (101)"
African Americans were limited to the most dangerous 'nigger work'.
Former slaves were prohibited from attending churches and schools, and banned from ballot boxes.
This institutions separated blacks and whites to separate residential districts and sections of commercial establishments.
This was fuelled partly through beliefs of 'racial degeneracy' believed to ensue frm mixing - lynching, rage, anger and more.

##### The ghetto (North, 19914-1968)

Blacks fled to the North by the millions due to the South.
Three forces combined to rouse them to move to the Midwest and Northeast: the economic crisis of cotton agriculture, mechanization and arrested urbanization int he south due to industrial underdevelopment.. Also, the booming demand for unskilled labour in the steel mills and factories of the North as the war cut off immigration from Europe.
These economic push and pull conditions, as well as the social reasons lead to African Americans to move North, a feeling of collective defiance.

In reality, they were confined to the ghetto - the whites viewed them as 'physically and mentally unfit' and undesirable and so they were segregated again. They were systematized in the economy, a 'job ceiling' set by white employers and if they tried to breach the colour line, they were assaulted and had to take refuge in the Black Belt.

This 'black city within the state' harnessed the labour of African Americans while cloistering their tainted bodies, "averting the spectre of 'social equality' and the odium of 'miscegenation' that would inevitably result in a loss of ethnic honour for the whites" but also "enabled African Americans to fully develop their own social and symbolic forms and thereby accumulate the group capacities needed to escalate the fight against continued caste subordination." (103)

The ghetto is an ethnoracial prison as it encloses a stigmatized population within its distinctive organizations and culture, while the prison functions as a judicial ghetto relegating individuals disgraced by criminal convictions to a secluded space harbouring the parallel social relations and cultural norms that make up the society of captives.

When the ghetto failed due to economic restructuring, the carceral institution was an apparatus to enforce the colour line and containing the segments of the Africn-American labour of blacks without economic utility or pull.. This comprised the fourth peculiar institution.

### The use of the ghetto as a device for caste control and the prison as containment for lower-class African Americans

#### From communal ghetto to hyperghetto: how the ghetto became more like a prison

There are four main characteristics that differentiate it sharply from the communal ghetto of the Fordist-Keynesian era and converge to render its social structure and social structure.

##### 1. Class segregation overlays racial segregation

With Chicago's South Side (1920s onwards), "the social distance between the classes was limited by physical propinquity and extensive family ties; the black bourgeoisie's economic power rested on supplying goods ... to its lower-class brethren; and all 'brown' residents of the city were united their common rejection of caste subordination" leading to "the post war ghetto was *integrated both socially and structurally*". (104)

Today's black bourgeoisie lives under strict segregation with limited life chances, and has established physical distance from the ghetto by building satellite black neighbourhoods at its periphery inside the city. The genealogical ties from the black rich to the black poor have grown poor.

##### **2. Loss of a positive economic function**

Essentially, the number of manufacturing establishments in Chicago plunged. The effects of technological upgrading and post industrialization were intensified by:
1. Unflinching residential segregation
2. The breakdown of public schools
3. The renewal of working-class immigration from Latin America and Asia to consign the uneducated blacks to redundancy

"The hyperghetto now serves the *negative economic function of storage of a surplus population* devoid of market utility, in which respect it also increasingly resemble the prison system." (105)

##### 3. State institution of social control replace communal institutions

"The organizations that  formed the framework of everyday life and anchored the strategies of reproduction of urban blacks in the 1950s were group-based and group-specific establishments created and run by African Americans." (105) In the past, African Americans can gain the illusion of advancement in the economic realm.

Now, Negro enterprise was small scale and weak. "The vacuum created by the crumbling of the ghetto's indigenous organizations has been filled by *state bureaucracies of social control*, themselves largely staffed by the new black middle class whose expansion hinges ... on its willingness to assume the vexing role of custodian of the black urban subproletariat on behalf of white society." (105)

Several institutions determined Chicago's South Side:
1. Humiliating welfare programs, restricted access to the public to push recipients into the low wage labour market
2. Bad public housing that subjected its tenants to criminal insecurity and scorn
3. Failing public health and public schools with results worthy of Third World countries
4. The police, the courts recruited by law enforcement agencies to capture deep into the ghetto.

##### 4. Loss of 'buffering function' and the depacification of everyday life

The ghetto lost its capacity to buffer its residents from external forces - it has devolved into a one-dimensional machinery for "naked relegation, a human warehouse wherein are discarded those segments of urban society deemed disreputable, derelict, and dangerous." (107).

Essentially, life is chaotic, networks are shortened, surveillance strategies are pushed on to give social relations a feeling of fear and danger, feeding mutual avoidance and retraction into one's private defended space to violence is the means for upholding respect, regulating defended space; controlling territory; and relations with official authorities are suffused with animosity and diffidence. 

The depacification of everyday life, shrinking of networks, and informalization of survival strategies have combined to give social relations in the hyperghetto a distinct carceral cast ... fear and danger pervade public space; interpersonal relations are riven with suspicion and distrust, feeding mutual avoidance and retraction into one's private defended space

We can see this through the *prisonisation* of public housing - retirement homes, single-room occupancy hotels that make houses feel like houses of detention, of being locked down and where public schools operate through *institutions of confinement* where schools learn to ensure 'custody and control' - herded into decaying facilities of underpaid teachers, repelling unwanted intruders and hemming students inside the school's walls.


#### From 'Big House' to warehouse: how the prison became more like a ghetto

There are five stages to this:
##### 1. The racial division of everything

The stable positions defined in criminal statuses have been replaced by a chaotic setting where 'racial division has primacy over all particular identities and influences all aspects of life'.

This has been presented in several ways. The environment you are in determine the probability of being the victim or perpetrator of violence: all are set by one's ethnic community of provenance

In Syke's account, the roles that make the social structure are specific to the carceral cosmos: we have 'rats' and 'centre men' who betray the core value of solidarity', 'merchants' who peddle gods, 'wolf', 'punks', and 'fags' who have sexual scripts adopted behind bars, 'ball busters' and 'real men' dependent on their sex with the guards. "Racial cleavages have grown to undercut and supplant carceral ones." (110)

##### 2. The 'code of the street' overwhelms the 'convict code'

"The predatory culture of the streets, centred on hyper masculinist notions of honour, toughness, and coolness has entered into and transfigured the social structure and culture of jails and prisons." (110)

Gangs have taken over the economy of the prison and destabilized the social system of inmates from 'doing your own time' to 'doing gang time'. The rise of drugs and racially-based clans has led to interpersonal and group brutality - those who leave and experience freedom realise that they cannot get along with fellow inmates.

The increased commotion that characterises prison life explains that it is not uncommon to find people in productive custody - penitentiaries across the country as authorities strive to restore order by relegating the worst of the worst, inmates are kept under total lock down.

##### 3. Purging the undesirable

Today's prison has the purpose to neutralise offenders thought to violate the law. First by removing them physically into an institutional enclave and symbolically by drawing a hard line between criminals and law-abiding citizens.

The prison, now used as an implement for social and cultural purging, turns it into a self-contained contraption which justifies its existence: people learn to live in the here-and-now, bathed in the concentrate of violence and hopelessness:
	![[Pasted image 20231219194019.png]]

##### 4. The proto-racialization of judicial stigma

The prison can be likened to the ghetto in that the stigma of penal conviction has been reframed that assimilate it to an ethnoracial stigma attached to the body of the bearer.

We've moved towards post-detention measures of criminal justice supervision. 

"The resurgence and popularity of genetic pseudo-explanations of crime is another indication ... towards the compulsive racialization of criminals whose counterparts is the elective ethnicization of crime victims, who have been fabricated into a quasi-ethnic group ... complete with its distinctive idiom, insignia..." (114).

We can't say once a criminal always a criminal - this pattern cannot be explained by accidents, situations and social forces as it modulates the criminogenic factors of low intelligence.

##### Bifurcated socioracial patterning of carceral recruitment and authority

Today's prison resembles the ghetto as an overwhelming majority of its occupants originate from the racialized core of the country's major cities, only to return and be caught again in a self-perpetuating cycle of socioeconomic marginality and legal incapacitation.

The contemporary prison system ... duplicates the authority structure characteristic of the [ghetto] in that it places a population of poor blacks under the direct supervision of whites... (115)

"The thesis of the structural-functional coupling of the remnants of the ghetto with the carceral system is supported by *the timing of racial transition*: with a lag of about a dozen years, the 'blackening' of the carceral population has followed closely on the heels of the demise of the Black Belt as a viable instrument of caste containment in the urban-industrial setting ... the sudden penal repression of African Americans had helped to shore up 'the walls of white supremacy as the South moved from an era of racial bondage to one of racial caste' (115)

The intertwining of the urban Black Belt and the carceral system is evidenced by the fusion of ghetto an d prison culture - gangsta rap singers and hiphop artists, the melting of street and carceral symbolism being re-exported to the ghetto and diffused throughout society to the teenage consumer market.

### The social reproduction of the black subproletariat, remaking 'race' through the ghetto

```ad-summary
I argue that ... the remnants of the dark ghetto and the fast-expanding carceral system of the US have become tightly linked by a triple realtionship of functional equivalency, structural homology, and cultural fusion. The relationship has spawned a carceral continuum that ensnares a super-numerary population of younger black men, who either reject or are rejected by the deregulated low-wage labour market in a never-ending circulus between the two institutions. This carceral mesh has been solidified by two sets of concurrent and interrelated changes: on the one end, sweeping economic and political forces have reshaped the structure and function of the urban 'Black Belt' of mid-century to *make the ghetto more like a prison*. On the other end, the 'inmate society' that inhabited the penitentiary system of the US during the postwar decades have broken down in ways that make the prison more like a ghetto. The resulting symbiosis between ghetto and prison not only enforces and perpetuates the socioeconomic marginality and symbolic taint of the urban black subproletariat, feeding the runaway growth of the penal system that has become a major component of the post-Keynesian state. It also plays a pivotal role in the remaking of 'race' and the redefinition of the citzeznry via the production of a racialized public culture of villification of criminals."" (97)
```

Each (Jim Crow system) and the ghetto are 'race maki'ng' institutions - each produces this divison out of inherited demarcations and disparities of group power, inscribing in it material and symbolic forms. It has racialised the arbitrary boundary between African Americans and all others.

This new conception of race is a consequence of a combination of slavery and democracy as modes of organization of social life after bondage has been established as the major form of labour conscription and control in an underpopulated colony home to a precapitalist system of production.

The fourth peculiar institution, the combination of the hyperghetto with the carceral system, remoulds the social meanings and significance of race in accordance to the deregulated economy.

First effect - the official solidification of the centuries-old association of blackness with criminality and violence (117)
Second effect - the penalization of 'the race question' via hypertrophic expansion of the prison system has been to depoliticize it - reframing the problems posed by the maintenance of ethnoracial divison in the wake of the ghetto's demise as issues of law enforcement delegitimates any attempts of resistance.
Even riots have been dominated by the white suburban electorate.

Today's inmates are the target of a threefold movement of exclusionary closure:
1. Prisoners are denied access to valued cultural capital ... being made ineligible for Pell grants, employment
2. Prisoners are systematically excluded from social redistribution and public aid in an age where work insecurity makes access to such programs more vital than ever.
3. Convicts are banned from political participation via 'criminal disenfranchisement'

Through this triple exclusion, the prison and justice system contribute to the reconstruction of the 'imagined community' of Americans around the opposite of working families - implicitly white, deserving and the underclass of criminals by defining them as dark-skinned, urban and undeserving.
