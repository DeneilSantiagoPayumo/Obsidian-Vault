Gargi Bhattacharya 2015 in Crisis, Austerity and Everyday Life
[[Welfare State And the Politics of Social Inclusion and Exclusion]]


My argument is that the logic and techniques of racism inform the practices of austerity in such a way as to enable the greater consolidation of systems of dispossession and disentitlement. The focus of this chapter is how practices and logics of racism under austerity remake the political space in such a way that greater dispossession and disentitlement are enabled.

## The racial state under austerity 111

It will be argued that the techniques of the racial state become central technologies to institute differential entitlement and in this create austerity as a racial project, even where there is little or no discernible targeting of racialised groups - austerity measures do not target racialised minorities but rather it marks the space of public life as a racialised terrain where bodies are ordered and attributed value according to arbitrary but highly consequential categorisation.

Central to this discussion is how the state is spoken by and through state practices - with Apartheid, race being hailed as the central organising principle of state decision-making that is the lens through which populations can be seen and the mode of being that shapes all encounters with the state. Race is the informing principle of all interactions between state and population.

This is [[David Goldberg]]'s argument - most incarnations of the racial state are racist indirectly, and we will consider how these processes infect everyday life. Many states are not racist states and the central principle of of many states has not been for racism - but racial states still achieve racial outcomes.

## Looking for the austerity state 113

What is the austerity state? The argument is that practices of austerity constitute a distinct shift in the business of welfare capitalism in decline.

Although these factors (realignment of government objectives, less regulation) coincide with neoliberalism, austerity should be regarded as a limited and located event - one incarnation of neoliberalism in action.

Austerity has represented a refinement and redeployment of many of the practices of the racial state with the purpose of renaturalising inequalities and involving us in the practices of hardening these inequalities.

```ad-quote
title: Goldberg's account of a racial state
... States are racial more deeply because of the structural position they occupy in producing ... racially shaped spaces and areas." (Goldberg, 2002, 104)

...

They are racist to the extent such definition, determination, and structuration operate to exclude or privilege in or on racial terms ... the naturalist view considers marginalised groups as inherently and peretually inferior whereas the historicist considers their racially differentiated groups as historically differentiated in maturity and development. (Goldberg, 2002, 106).
```

The reworking of state practices in the name of austerity - deleting items from the menu of citizen rights ... deleting items from the menu of **entitlement**. There is a hardening of inequality that leads to increasing dispossession.

Austerity has retrenched long-standing patterns of inequality and also instituted new practices of sorting the population, re-arranging and dismantling regimes of entitlement. This has entrapped civil society into participation in practices of governmentality that come to suffuse the public sphere.

## Terror and the racial state

Despite austerity, war and security must be funded. Goldberg would argue racist practices are carried out in the interests of the racist ruling class. However, there are adjustments in the process of racial ordering - terms of the membership of the ruling class have changed for the states most racist. Many societies believe that racial exclusion of past time has passed.

Austerity however (to the author) cannot replicate the racial ruling class: we are living through a shift in the balance of global capital, leading to a transnational economic elite who transcend any local ruling class.

Goldberg wants to stress the autonomy between histories of racism and those of capitalist development. The racial ruling class are not the bourgeoisie although they must have been at some point.

The author claims a continuation and hardening of boundaries around a racially excluded class - some accommodation to retain privilege and this has led to a huddling together of the ethnically diverse monied class.

## Is the austerity state a racial state? 118

The phraseology and techniques of austerity appear to be insistently post-racial, resting on that previous racial privileges will no longer offer protection - in the logic of austerity, there is room only for the elite and the mass.

Austerity state represents a shift away from the privatising of differentiation that Goldberg claims is an element of the recent racial state - austerity practices are used to embed practices of disempowering and cruel differentiation. The possibility of such differentiation is through projects of immigration and anti-terrorism law.

## Immigration controls: marking the shifting border between the deserving and the other 119

The demarcation of an other applies to its ability to police national borders.

As the twentieth century went on, borders and belonging became central markets of exclusion and entitlement - practices that have been developed to create the multitude of internal borders of the xenoracist state could be seen as a template for the stripping away of entitlement due to the machinery that develops to sustain a highly complex set of practices place some as lesser and task others as reinforced exclusion.

## Contradictory bordering 120

The ability to police your own borders has become a central test of sovereignty - the role of national government is to safeguard the territory and population of the nation, and thus is a theatrical demonstration of authority. Allowing no space to consider transnational alliances and solidarities including those based on familial and ethnic ties, recent years have seen increasing popular energy on the status of the border.

Scholars argue that the border represents a complex machinery of contemporary governance.

```ad-quote
title: [[Bridget Anderson]] (2023, 2)
International borders are presented as filters ... as has been observed more frequently ... borders reach into the heart of poltiical space ... they may be more usefully analysed as producing rather than reflecting status, creating specific types of social, political and economic relations.
```

These are the practices that sort us into categories of legality and entitlement that allow us entry into the labour market, our interactions with the state and our ability to access social and private goods. For her, practices of border control can: create categories of entrant, influencing of employment relations and institutionalisation of uncertainty.

For Anderson the category of entrant refers to the manner and legality in which the border is approached and cross, there is a close affinity between this and the categorisation of differential entitlement to public goods. In her book, she argues that immigration controls create the categories of citizen, non-citizen, failed citizen, and tolerated citizen, a continuum of varied relations that informs other social outcomes.

These sifting of human status influence our manner of entry to the labour market and wider institutionalisation of uncertainty, creating precarity that allows austerity practices to remake everyday life.

## Fencing and gate-keeping 121

[[Triandafyllidou and Ambronsini]] examine the contradiction taken to immigration control by Italy and Greece - criticized for their failure to police borders and condemned for failure to respect the rights of migrants and asylum-seekers.

They develop a framework that distinguishes between 'fencing and gatekeeping', 'external and internal control policies', between 'their internal within the country's territory', 'external at the border or outside the border' and their fencing (stopping) versus 'gate-keeping (preventing) nature.'

This can help us understand how Europe responds to a vocal anti-migrant politics that demands strict border control whilst relying on migrants to fill a range of low-paid and low-status jobs.

The prior two scholars ask how a restrictive policy towards immigrations and a policy of a reproduction of irregular resident workers can coexist.

Anderson believes we should see these as interdependent and not contradictory: the more generalised logic of rendering people illegal to view their claims to through this illegitimacy is important to note here.

## Standardisation in the service of differentiation (122)

Taras writes, in explaining variation in approaches to immigration and the lack of standardisation or harmonisation, that "directives setting a minimum level of common standards might be a more accurate expression ... policies ... have not become harmonised across the EU and remain inconsistent between states."

It reveals the priority of EU policy - standardisation can be seen strongly in the tightening of border controls: while facilitating passport-free travel for citizens of most European countries (in 1990s) it has evolved into a border control regime to manage and keep out non-citizens.

There has been movements towards cooperation in some practices of gating: the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum ... revealed the explicit move towards differentiation as an important technique in border control.

Tara writes:
```ad-quote
title: Tara, 2012, 40
"This pact combined a liberal approach in some areas with an augmented securitisation agenda in others ... combating illegla immigration, regulating legal in-migration and promoting development. It opened borders for some groups but reinforoced border controls on others."
```

This practice of bordering and the complex and contradictory processes of immigration control (and bureaucracy and compliance) that provide the framework that informs austerity practices.

## Instituting differential concepts of the breadline 124

State assistance has tended to be calculated to ensure only an uncomfortable survival by reminders that this life is caused by dependency. In recent times, welfare has been a belonging of bare survival.

The existence of the two differently calculated levels of basic income (subsistence income in the UK for those seeking asylum below the breadline payment to non-working EU and UK nationals). Even our understanding of the minimum requirements for life can be differentiated and established in the everyday consciousness.

## Making irregular migrants in public space 124

This process has included practices of stigmatisation - conspicuous markers of lesser entitlement such as the payment of subsistence benefits in voucher and not money which used (now taken away) to mark the irregular status of migrants to those around them, making a shopping trip as that of demonstrating entitlement.

Again, [[Triandafyllidou and Ambronsini]] talk about the shift after 2009 European elections that made the government theatricalise the arrest of irregular migrants - targeting public places as metro stations and squares and not work sites or sectors that immigrants work.

This is engaging in internal fencing activity without pursuing parallel internal gate-keeping policies, echoing the variable practices. But for us, we should regard it as stigmatisation for other ends - the public marking of migrants lays the way for more inclusion and exclusion and innovations of austerity.

## Deploying destitution as both threat and disciplinary measure 125

This process comes to prominence alongside another aspect of border control - the practice of deploying destitution is developed through the administration of immigration control. The withholding of access to any and all public services for those outside of documented status has become embedded in the immigration control regimes of Europe - those who do not make their claim for asylum lose the right to make a claim in another country. They are destined for removal.

An EU report on destitution finds it on three factors: material deprivation (dependent on goodwill, welfare and charity), social exclusion and level of control over one's life. (Regioplan, 2014, 7)

In this report, the authors find that migrants have been rendered destitute as a result of policy choices that include laws that exclude migrants from welfare and limited access to public goods and services, in practice, barriers arising from bureaucracy and lack of knowledge prevent migrants from accessing support. These structures cast destitute migrants into dependence.

## Detention, deportation, and securitising everyday life 126

The spectacularising of forced removals is not new. The detention of migrants is an established protocol - presented as linked to imminent deportation.

Detention and deportation are practices that reveal the intersection between immigration control and security practices - representing another instance of a parallel system of justice where due process and evidence are not needed. The onus is on the suspect to prove they are not illegal.

To understand this whole presumption of guilt without credentials, we turn into other key arenas of parallel legality.

## Constructing the terrorist suspect 127

The government's responses to the war on terror across the world represent a key shift in how relations between states and populations are imagined in our time.

In the process, long-established practices of marking boundaries of belonging and identifying outsiders are updated to become defences against threats to our very existence.

[[Louise Amoore]] argues that a key aspect of this will to defend is the incursion of the concept of pre-emptive identification and exclusion into the everyday practices of state security. Amoore suggests the term 'data derivative' as a route into comprehending this formation of categorisation and surveillance.

```ad-quote
title: Amoore, 2011, 27
"This form of data derivate emerging in contemporary security risk management is not a more advanced form of abstraction, but rather ... [one] that correlates more conventional state collection of data with emergent and unfolding futures."
```

Essentially, the dominant mode of correlation between elements of data collection shifts to better meet the objectives of the pre-emptive states - here, older forms of disciplinary categorisation and surveillance are employed to gather data but the significance of said data is reworked to favour rules of anticipation - what matters is the capacity to act in the face of uncertainty.

Central to this analysis is the suggestion of a mobile norm that moves in relation to a number of axes - this 'deviation' that can never be specified ahead of time, techniques reliant on data derivatives are designed to identify and expel. Amoore describes a world in which techniques of government map unexpected non-normative moments as indications of future guilt: not any one of us can go to a precise configuration of factors that constitute such non-norm instances and thus it is not possible for us to ensure that we will not be caught in this pre-emptive identification of threat.

We too may be the imagined objections of privations and no way of knowing if these cruelties come to us or to others in our stead ... it is our reliance on a technological solution that appears to erase and forget human particularity that represents the exclusion of critical thinking.

Amoore and De Goede suggest that this absenting of human discretion from the process of identifying threat is another aspect of the post-racial and a reassurance 'offered to civil liberty groups as being more objective ... than the potentially discriminatory and prejudicial decision taken by [personnel]'

This self-evidence of the conclusions of such technicised solutions represents another precursor to the degradation of politics - the downplaying of judgement in favour of the opaque magic of algorithmic assessment of risks leaves no space for human agency, and such processes disallow critiques of racism as they are presented as untainted by human failings of prejudice.

```ad-quote
title: Amoore and DE Goede summarise this incarnation of post-racial logics in the service of exclusion and dispossession.
![[Pasted image 20231114201358.png]]
```

Target populations remain limited, with the suggestion that a greater good is safeguarded by the identification and exclusion of the threat - yet the demarcation into those with legitimate business carries into the practices of austerity, with the rhetoric of assessing future risk employed both as an element of reiterating the uncertainty and openness to recalculation of all entitlement. The broader suggestions that some people are lesser and deserving of lesser treatment in the name of societal safety becomes embedded.

## A global movement away from due legal process 130

The Humans Right Watch wrote that more than 140 governments have passed counterterrorism legislation since September 11. They explain that much of the world has shifted in the post-9/11 era - an element of self-congratulation as European responses have retained the anti-terrorism initiatives as an issue of criminality, enabling a continued attention to issues of human rights.

The term of 'terrorist suspect' emerges - nations that have not succumbed to participation in each military aspect of the war on terror still demonstrate their shared worldview through the energies devoted to defining and outlawing the terrorist suspect.

[[Monica den Boer]] argues that in areas of the world like Netherlands, the development of anti-terrorism legislation represents three areas of innovation: policy shifts focusing on preventing terrorism, including through repressive means; institutional shifts that brought together an array of relevant actors and legal shifts that changed processing of acts of, terrorism.

These concerns typically cover more than what is understood as terrorist - they define terrorism using broad language.

In the same report, the Humans Rights Watch outlines of key areas of concern. These include:
1. Definitions of terrorism and terrorist act
2. Designations of terrorist organisations and banning membership in them
3. Restrictions on funding and support to terrorism
4. Limitations on expressions or assembly that encourage terrorism
5. Expansion of police powers that undermine basic rights
6. Creation of special courts and modifications of trial procedures to favour the prosecution by limiting defendant's due process rights
7. Imposition of the death penalty for terrorism-related offences
8. Creation of administrative detention

## Erosions in access to the due process of law

A key element of this presentation of emergency legislation has been the bypassing of established practices around the due process of law - the sense of emergency and existential threat has been sued to argue that previous agreements about the right to a fair trial cannot be maintained for this group.

We have had: detention without trial, barriers to hearing the sources of prosecution, extradition agreements without access to details of allegations. These innovations represent an institutionalisation of lesser status in the eyes of the law.

These innovations represent the erosions of due process undertaken in the name of border control.

## Reading the signs of radicalisation 133

An important element of logic of pre-emption is the suggestion that future violence can be discerned through close surveillance of everyday behaviours - pre-emptive status attribution. It is this hope that future actions or outcomes can be extrapolated that informs the machinery of pre-emption in everyday state practices.

[[Glaessner]] writes of developments in German law passed under the provisions of the protection of the constitution that includes the gathering and evaluation of information on any activities directed against the 'peaceful coexistence of people'.

This demonstrates the development of a process that empowers authorities to interpret non-criminal behaviour as precursors to possible future crime - status here is attributed pre-emptively.

## Criminalising actions that have yet to take place 133

The reframing of political life at local and global levels should be understood as the introduction of pre-emptive actions by the powerful. However, the introduction of pre-emptive action has yet to enter anti-terrorism law: this logic has informed the justification for increasing surveillance and collection of personal data.

Glaessner describes:
	![[Pasted image 20231114213632.png]]

There also has been an amendment of the Asylum Procedure Act to include new measures for identifications - fingerprints of asylum seekers will be matched and stored. This creates groups who are deemed to be guilty at a later date.

### Creating a parallel system of law 134

Initiatives taken in the name of the war on terror have instituted parallel systems of justice, leading to suspects being taken through a parallel world of secret courts.

Both conceptually and in terms of legal process is a category of people who do not enjoy the same entitlement to legal process as others, siphoning them into a parallel set of processes.

These two sets of practices create two distinct objects of categorisation, exclusion and containment. Status must be constantly re-examined.

### Experiences of racism and anti-state expression 135

The time of crisis has spawned violence - racism remains uncodified.

Changing techniques of state racism increasingly occlude racial categories - the techniques derived from fencing and gating and pre-emptive ordering of the non-normative work together to enable the racial state of our time to continue under the pretences of the post-racial. These processes of categorisation and dispossession seep into areas of resource distribution and value attribution.

The bureaucratic response to racism has been to proliferate categories through an expansive register of ethnicity and through attempts to articulate the complexity of intersectional identities (see Equality Act 2010) making it harder to identify racism.

The dismantling and reconfigurations undertaken in the name of the austerity state can seem like an escape from racism through bureaucracy - when racist exclusions and violence are experienced, it becomes harder to name the character. These techniques help mute complaints of racism.

The attitudes of groups facing racism are shaped by this experience of disallowing their experience - the incapability of understanding leads to an articulation of anti-politics stemming from legitimate distrust and disappointment in public institutions.

In austerity, we see racist outcomes continue - those living with racist outcomes may distrust an appeal to a state-centred redress, the official racism of austerity may be a continuation of the racism of the pre-austerity state.

The debate about neoliberalism has focused on the market - the key aspect of neoliberal thinking and practice. Distrust of the state can also play a role in shaping poplar attention.

The celebration of the market is discernible in the conditions forced upon nations requiring bailout by the European Central Bank or IMF - this smashing of key aspects of the delivery of social goods via the state in favour of the distributive functions of the market has been much discussed. The opening of 'market forces' is how we know that these are the actions of our enemies as we know the market favours and covers for the transfer of publicly owned assets into private hands.

## Uncovering the depth of institutional racism 138

In 2013, new information about police surveillance of the family of Stephen Lawrence became public. This shaped subsequent state initiatives around racism in Britain - the long and wide-ranging public enquiry confirmed the failures of policing as institutional racism, leading to the shaping of requirements of the Race Relations Amendment Act and a generation of activity seeking to make public institutions accountable to all parts of society.

The author describes an example in Greece, an example in France and so on.

Much of the literature discussing neoliberalism implies that the ideology of the market has infected everybody but it is not clear whether most of the population embrace the logic of marketisation or whether the logics of marketisation reconstruct the terrain of sociality. The author believes that the constructed structures of inequality and exclusion that make structural racism create different entry points into social relations, other barriers may limit the extent to which some people can meaningfully participate.

Should we regard anti-state sentiment as an embrace of the market? There are indications that groups vulnerable to racism can embrace the trappings of marketized value and develop modes of survival that mobilise aspects of the dominant conception of economic health such as self-employment. We give too much discourse to neoliberalism however if we regard economic activity that bypasses state intervention as examples of market fundamentalism, but we may expect too much from discourse of anti-austerity if we hope this call will rally all who suffer in welfare capitalism before austerity.

We are too accustomed to consumer culture - commodification, capital wants and so on. Now, this return to smaller-scale market transactions (as we are not useful objects of wage exploitation) may leave the punitive aspect of statecraft as the most conspicuous remnants of the government.

## Austerity as occasion for hatred - moments of consent and the fall into voicelessness 140

I want to suggest that consent is elicited for particular moments of state activity, remaking the terrain of what is possible.

The **pre-emptive logics and techniques of disentitlement** has infected the arenas of criminal justice and social policy - a practice of exercising power that creates a retrospective narrative of legitimacy. It is a tactic that seeks to steal ground.

We can see this tactic as initiating a contentious action pre-emptively to ensure that the outcome of such actions can shape a narrative of legitimisation.

**Are these times of austerity more racist than what went before?**

Each strand of re-emergent racism can traced to the time of austerity has a longer history. Throughout this chapter, we've sought to argue that austerity inhabits the practices of the racial state in order to extend these techniques of sorting, categorizing and differentiating - mobilising racial names, or modes that defy our understanding of the processes of group thinking.

Increasing impoverishment does impact largely on racialised communities - a continuation of the processes that have sustained systemically unequal societies. What is distinctive about austerity racism has been the resurgence of far-right electoral parties who gain popularity as part of a protest against the inadequacies of democracy.

Two complains of anti-politics (complains centred around self-segregation of the political class, making them able to profess cosmopolitanism):
1. Accusation that immigration is uncontrolled or encouraged due to the predilections of the political elite ... perhaps a continuation of xenophobia.
2. The other element extends the critique of political life but shifts focus - that political representation does not work because political representatives no longer hold influence over the most significant arenas of life.

Immigration is the issue that reveals the inadequacy of politics - the view that there's no room for representative politics in a globalised world, that political representation has no power to mediate, courtesy of [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]].


These two trends mean an expression of anti-migrant racism that can fold into dissatisfaction. We must begin by accepting that no particular even predicts the emergence of new racism.

## Why does anti-politics reignite racism?

A theme common to both (parties of anti-politics) is the promise to break away from business as usual with business as usual exemplified by the issue of immigration - we see attempts to mobilise a progressive movement against austerity also include reference to the rights of migrants. Hage describes this as anti-racist racism where the target of racism struts the superiority of their culture.

Another anti-immigrant sentiment is a claim to a kind of differentiated racism - the adoption of anti-migrant rhetoric and sentiment by minoritized group represents an acceptance of the framework of racism. This is the power of racism to shape our lives and self - that the settled minorities are unlike the unsettled.

The most obvious aspect of austerity racism is how hardship is concentrated among the racialised - stuff that's charted, rates of unemployment, household income and such. In a context where the powerful seek to remake the terms of entitlement and curtail access to state resources, those who already battle barriers of racism will suffer - they find their incomes and choices squeezed.

What is significant is how austerity logic and practice create an intensification of racist exclusions by repetitive confirmation of differential entitlement - that people are not all the same and thus are not of all worth.

# Conclusion:

-> implications for shifts in understanding of racial injustice
-> a review of state activity
-> this volume arises from a belief that austerity measures of post-2008 are remaking the practices and expectations of state activity and practices across Europe.

The project of austerity should be seen as a process of disentitlement - remake subjectivity so those who have imagined themselves as citizens learn to re-narrate the terrain of political life, constructing the subject as holder of rights to be fulfilled to infringements to be punished.

We are guilty before we know it and thus we dismantle public institutions in the name of austerity.
