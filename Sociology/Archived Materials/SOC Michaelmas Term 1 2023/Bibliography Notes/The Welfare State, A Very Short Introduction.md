## What is the welfare state?

```ad-abstract
There are three general conceptions used for the welfare state: the first characterizes the welfare state as welfare for the poor; the second focuses on social insurance, social rights, and social services; and the third highlights economic management and the role that the ‘government of the economy’ plays in every welfare state. ‘What is the welfare state?’ explains that welfare states are varied, complex, and difficult to define. There is no simple theory that clearly expresses what they do, no simple vision that neatly captures what they are for. The welfare state is a damage-limiting, problem-solving device rather than anyone’s ideal social relationship.

Misunderstandings of the welfare:
- It is not a thing of the past killed by market forces
- It is not a drag on spirit or a totalitarian bureaucracy
- It is not just 'welfare for the poor'

### The 'welfare state' as a misnomer

Welfare states are not primarily about welfare, and not especially centred around the poor - they are about social insurance, social rights, social provision and the social regulation of economic action. They are not about the state or state institutions: the services and benefits these programs provide are not produced or delivered by state officials: it is distributed to many agents, private corporations, religious associations and so on.

Additionally, no modern state 'is' a welfare state. It is striking that there is no state that lacks a developed welfare state apparatus that absorbs a fraction of public expenditure. It is often thought of a sloth-like loser receiving undeserved benefits from an overbearing state.

### What is the welfare state?

Actual welfare states are varied - Sweden has a largely expansive and egalitarian welfare state compared to the market-oriented version that exists in the USA, and Sweden's state are quite different from others.

Welfare states change over time but beneath it is a shared foundation.
Let's talk about the welfare state in general - the web of welfare state practice is in every nation involving a multitude of laws, programmes, and agencies. To grasp the larger issues at stake, we need to consider the larger picture of which these programmes form a part.

The first characterizes the welfare state as welfare for the poor - this is a narrow concept and refers only to the most problematic and least popular aspects of the system, the non-contributory, means-tested relief.

The second focuses on social insurance, social rights and social services - social policy research and the NHS that accounts for most government social expenditure. It also includes public education.

The third conception highlights economic management and the role that the government of the economy plays in every welfare state - the conception used by political economists and sociologists. This highlights the government's regulatory, fiscal, monetary, and labour-market policies and their roles in shaping markets. These dimensions are frequently overlooked.

These ideas form a structurally integrated element of the whole. At the core of the welfare state are the institutions that insure against loss of earnings by reason of unemployment - the operation of these schemes are pitched at a national level and is itself a mode of economic governance. These schemes depend for their solvency on government policies that raise taxes, sustain employment, and promote growth by smoothing labour flexibility, enable counter-cyclical spending and more.

### The welfare state's pragmatism

Welfare states are varied, complex, and difficult to define, This complexity creates difficulty for advocates:  the welfare state lacks utopian ideals and a pantheon of heroic proponents. They rarely achieve complete success.

The welfare state is a damage-limiting, problem-solving device. Progressives claim it is too mean and a poor substitute for the distribution and conservatives argue that it is too generous. Welfare recipients insist that they would prefer a good job. Taxpayers argue that they work too hard to bear the costs of those who do not work and so on.

### The indispensable welfare state

Welfare states are a fundamental feature of the world in which we live - take the 2008 financial crisis. Let's explore more.

## Birth of the welfare state

```ad-abstract
‘Birth of the welfare state’ describes the embryonic version of the welfare state in Germany with Chancellor Bismarck’s social insurance laws in the 1880s. A decade later governments in Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia launched the first old age pension schemes. In the early 1900s Liberal governments in Britain introduced workmen’s compensation, old age pensions, labour exchanges, and a system of National Insurance for sickness, invalidity, and unemployment. In the 1930s President Roosevelt established the American welfare state with the ‘New Deal’ legislation. The new welfare states were expanded post-war and by 1960 every developed nation had a core of welfare state institutions and every government had accepted responsibility for managing its national economy.
```

An embryonic version emerged when Chancellor Bismarck enacted the first social insurance law. A decade later, in Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia, came about the first old age pension schemes. In the early 1900s, Liberal governments in Britain introduced workmen's compensation.

By the 1930s, President Roosevelt responded to the Great Depression with a massive public works programme and then with the 'New Deal' legislation that established the American welfare state. By 1960s nearly every developed nation had a core of welfare state institutions

The new welfare states varied - reflecting each nation's history of social provision, its religious traditions, the character of its state and the political coalition.

To account for this, we need a general, developmental explanation - a set of social dynamics and circumstances that were common to all the western nations.

### The hazards of industrial society

At the start, the nations of Western Europe and North America struggled to cope with the disruptions brought about by industrialization, urbanization and rapid population growth.

Mass migration to towns and cities changed how people lived. Rapid growth strained amenities and infrastructure and governments struggled to cope with expanding needs for housing. Poor people's problems spilled into rich people's problems and social life became collective.

This led to high unemployment, widespread destitution and more.

### New social forces

They created social forces with the potential to remedy them - industrialization concentrated workers in large mines and factories, facilitating the growth of labour organization. Trade federations appeared.

The emergence of organized labour pushed western societies towards a universal franchise creating new demands for economic security and redistributive policies.

### Failures of social provision

The creation of welfare states was prompted by the failure of existing social failure: poor law officials, church leaders, charity workers and more were conscious of the system's problems but the inability of the old arrangements to cope with urban poverty meant no healing.

Laissez-faire liberalism didn't really work. Hazards of unemployment could not be met from savings when work was so poorly paid.

Another reform was to do with a more 'scientific' approach - pioneered by the COS. They stressed the need for classification and importance of personal giving. This approach was  no match for the problems. The sheer volume overwhelmed them.

### New recipes for action

Expansive ideas of freedom, citizenship, social conceptions of rights and justice took shape.

This new liberalism insisted that individual freedom was best fostered not by leaving people to their own devices but by securing for them the education and welfare needed to exercise real autonomy.

### State capacity

In much of the developed world, the state capacity needed for this effective action emerged by the beginning of the 20th century. Officials, in response, developed expertise, put in place standards, created inspectorates, established new departments of states charged with managing the problem.

Essentially, the experience of two World Wars have greatly expanded the reach of state regulation, planning and the direction of supplies and production, demonstrating the ability of governments to mobilize populations and run economies.

### Catalysing event

The emergence of welfare states was prompted by momentous events that made structural reforms appear both possible and necessary.

First, the great Depression - international trade broke down, democratic governments collapsed, ushering in Fascist and Nazi regimes and more. Capitalists acknowledged the benefits of a new system of currency and capital control.

The events of these years shifted the balance of political power and the character of social relations, increasing the influence of trade unions and working people. During World War II, the British government had sought trade union cooperation.

Mobilizing for war changed the combatant nation - rulers in wartime have always tried to ensure the loyalty of their militaries. In total war, national leaders wanted to win the commitment of masses of civilians and the promise of large-scale social reform was an important means to this end. War made population's health a political concern, with the remarkable result that food rationing average levels of health improved.

### Coalition for reform

Welfare states were built by political leaders who built them belonged to various parties, were possessed of diverse ideologies and pursued multiple objectives.

By the 1940s, the need for new institutions was broadly accepted. Welfare stares came about through broad coalitions representing farmers, middle classes and professionals.

Their motives was diverse - European leaders sought to bind the middle class to the democratic state by offering social provision that would benefit the better off as well as the poor, and the working class had to be won over as communism gained its appeal.

Reformers of all parties combined high-minded moral purpose with partisan motivation - welfare payments were given as a matter of social justice, in exchange for votes or loyalty to the state and more. Social welfare was made to humanize capitalism and make it more resistant to socialist challenge, enable citizenship and positive liberty.

To be for the welfare state was to be in favour of the social control of economic processes rather than in favour of entrusting these processes to the private choices of individual entrepreneurs, multi national corporations or financial speculators.

Keynes believed that welfare states helped manage capitalism better.

Employers in different countries were varied in reaction - American employers fought to preserve inequalities, promote company-based welfare and suppress units but they all saw the need for social insurance.

## The welfare state 1.0

```ad-abstract
The newly-emergent welfare states shared a distinctive set of features that set them apart both from the old poor laws and from state socialism. ‘The Welfare State 1.0’ identifies these defining features and describes how welfare states are structured. Welfare states generally have five institutional sectors: social insurance; social assistance; publicly funded social services; social work and personal social services; and economic governance. The WS 1.0 forms that predominated from the 1940s until the 1980s are described. Another feature of the welfare state landscape is sometimes called the ‘hidden welfare state’; it consists of welfare benefits that are channelled through the tax system or through private employment contracts.
```

### Welfare state sectors

They usually have five sectors:
1. Social insurance
2. Social assistance
3. Publicly funded social services
4. Social work and personal social services
5. Economic governance

*Social insurance* against loss of earnings is the cornerstone of the welfare state - taking the central problem of capitalist labour markets and by collective risk pooling indemnifies losses and generalizes security.

Social insurance programmes are typically state-administered, legally compelled, comprehensive schemes designed to protect workers against loss of earnings.

In schemes such as National Insurance in the UK, employees are obliged to make regular contributions on the basis of which they are entitled to sickness and disability benefits.

Social insurance schemes are enduringly popular with the public as they have proven effective in reducing hardship among the elderly and short-term unemployed. The public favours the benefit-in-exchange for contribution character of these schemes.

The working class benefits more than they put in.

*Social assistance* refers to the safety net on non-contributory, income-support programmes that relieve those whose income is insufficient for their basic needs.

These benefits are selective and means-tested: food stamps, earned income tax credits, child tax credits.

It is funded out of general taxation and is modestly redistributive: strongly gendered with primary recipients being women and children. This is the least popular with the public and prompts moral panic about work-shy scroungers.

*Publicly-funded social services* provide free access to goods such as education, healthcare, childcare, public transport, legal aid, and so on.

These public services come close to being social rights - being provided as of right and operating outside the market: employee rights like minimum wages, paid holidays, parental leave...

*Social work and personal social services* - provide forms of support such as social work with families, children's services, social care for the elderly, community care for the mentally ill. In these instances, social work professionals engage with clients in ways that combine care and control.

They aim to normalize and discipline - targeting lower-class populations. [[Jacques Donzelot ]]describes these as ways to police the family where families deemed problematic are inspected and pressed to be normal. In these ways, welfare states regulate and secure families, regulating and securing economies.

*Government of the economy* - these programmes depend upon the operation of large-scale government controls on economic life: monetary policy, tax laws, fiscal policy, and so on. Here, nationalization of industry are instruments of economic management used in welfare states,

After 1945, governments assumed responsibility for assuring economic growth, shaping institutions of economic governance and used planning, direct controls, Keynesian, monetarist, supply-side and neoliberal policies.

Even today, economic governance remains an essential element of welfare states and annual expenditure budgets still operate as basic tools of economic management - large-scale impacts on national economies. Welfare states themselves are big job-creators employing millions of people.

Also, there's the *hidden welfare state* - welfare benefits channelled through the tax system like home-mortgage tax allowances, or corporate welfare schemes are subsidized and regulated by government.

### Functions and dysfunctions

Welfare policies are rarely carried out smoothly because while the relationship between the welfare state and market capitalism is necessary it is structurally contradictory. The result is a contradictory hybrid where each structure works to sustain and undermine the other (private economic action and public social protection) - within this arrangement the welfare state is the subordinate or ancillary institution. The result is that welfare state policies generally stop short of posing challenges to private property.

Welfare state government is a delicate balancing act. These states seek to impose social and political controls on economic and family processes. This fundamental contradiction ensures that welfare states are often prone to functional difficulties.

Welfare state programmes are generally ameliorative rather than curative - they manage failure and dysfunction rather than offer radical cures - a limitation that exasperates advocates and critics alike. While welfare programmes moderate insecurity and instability they do not abolish structural sources of those problems - they sustain capitalist markets and private property.

### A new style of governing

Collective efforts to impose social regulation have been a feature of societies throughout the course of human history.

The profound discontinuity marking the welfare state's emergence was a fundamental change in rationality of the government - thinking about and acting of problems of unemployment, insecurity and uncertainty.

In this new Keynesian approach (that the market could reach equilibrium at low levels of employment and produce prolonged destructive depressions) they became virtues that brought economic benefits.

### Varieties of the welfare state

```ad-abstract
Every developed country has a distinctive welfare state of its own. Welfare states generally rely on the same basic institutions, but these institutions can operate in different ways. Welfare state programmes are government programmes, but while public authority is necessary to establish, fund, and regulate these programmes, the nature of government involvement varies. Three worlds of welfare have been identified: social democratic; conservative; and liberal. ‘Varieties’ describes the welfare state regimes that developed in Sweden, Germany, and the USA, each of which exemplifies one of these ‘worlds’ of welfare. It goes on to consider briefly the welfare regimes beyond the ‘three worlds’ and how Britain’s welfare regime has changed over time.
```

Only particular welfare state exists.

They rely on the same basic institutions - social insurance, social assistance, public services and so on. They operate in different ways: unemployment insurance may provide eligibility, easy access, high-level benefits or might be restrictive.

More fundamental policy choices concern the structure of these institutions: who and what they cover, how they are funded. Social insurance typically covers loss of earnings due to old age. British NHS covers the needs of the whole population

Access and eligibility are important variables: benefits may be available to all like American public schools or restricted to those who served the country, with Veterans Administration benefits.

The funding of welfare programmes varies - social insurance is financed by contributions deducted from employee wages, supplemented by matching contributions from employers and government. Contribution may be flat rate or graduated.

Taxation is another source - taxes may be imposed by local governments, take the form of income tax, wealth tax, so on and so forth, acting as a redistributive instrument with progressive taxation.

Welfare state programmes are government programs but the nature of involvement varies - some are administrative responsibility of government, some are not.

Government agencies are increasingly outsourcing service delivery to private agencies - social assistance are delivered by purchase-provider arrangements of this kind. Social workers in Germany are trained professionals. In the US, they are low paid.

Benefits may be paid as cash transfers or provided in kind - provided as tokens, exchanged for use for example.

The details of its coverage, access, funding and administration determines its redistributive impact and social meanings. Targeted programmes have low take-up rates and fail to reach those whom they are intended. Universal programmes are more expensive but achieve wider support.

Cultural values shaping welfare may vary - income support may be designed to enable recipients to quit the job market or press recipients into work by restricting viable alternatives. Some programs insure male breadwinner and treat wives and children as dependent, others have coverage for married women. They all seek to protect children and promote 'good enough' parenting.

...

In short some regimes reinforce the importance of marriage, prerogatives of employers, importance of private charity, power of the market and more.

### Three worlds of welfare

Welfare states can be differentiated by reference to size and cost: Nordic regimes are the largest, continental regimes followed by anglophone nations. But these are a crude number: public expenditure figures omit tax exemptions and allowances that are welfare transfers and ignores the effect of taxation that claws back benefits to high income recipients. Also, income expenditure can increase as unemployment numbers increase.

[[Esping-Andersen]] distinguishes:
1. A *social democratic* regime type (of the Nordics) that exhibits high levels of decommodification, generous universal benefits and strong cross-class solidarity, state rather than private provision
2. A *conservative* regime (of Germany, Austria, France) with moderate levels of decommodification, the retention of occupational hierarchies, a commitment to subsidiarity principles
3. A *liberal* regime of Anglophones that have low levels of commodification, low level benefits and an overarching concern to reinforce markets.

### Sweden

- Welfare state based on cooperative economic management backed by social policies that cater both to well off and worser off citizens
- Social provision is comprehensive - universal coverage, guaranteed minimums, basic security
- Earnings-related benefits provide high replacement rates and social services are of high quality
- Tax levels are high but good state services, income security and egalitarian society.
- Social services are state provided.

- Social insurance covers all citizens and does not distinguish between occupational groups. Redistributive taxes and transfers reduce market inequalities, with rent control making housing affordable; equal access to health care;; personal autonomy that reduces dependency on wives on husbands and more. The result is a society that combines high collective provision with individualistic values and lifestyles.

- Reduce reliance of individuals on families and promote gender equality

This labour market has the government combine with businesses. Also, trade unions have high power - national agreements, economy-wide wage bargaining.

It is very progressive.

### Germany

Like Sweden aiming to govern the economy with corporatist conciliatory mechanisms but does so in ways that reproduce occupational and status differentials and reinforce traditional family structures - less social rights and less decommodification and lower control over market processes *and* fewer social rights.

It is primarily an insurance state - coverage is compulsory and comprehensive, but not uniform: contributions are earnings-related.

The *Sozialstaat* is an associational state - social insurance is administered by multiple distinct schemes managed by private organizations run by representatives of employers and employee organizations. Tightly regulated associations compete to control costs and attract participants. It creates a stratified system.

This is a familiaist state that is committed to the preservation of traditional families - it is assumed that families would take care of children and benefits are structured accordingly.

Germany has fewer women-friendly policies. The result is that women's labour market participation are lower than in the USA.

The social market economy Germany established designed to enable an organized approach, great emphasis is placed on vocational training and human capital investment. This is a boon for manufacturing firms that have prospered. That said, strong job protections are problematic - reducing the capacity for change and creating a gap between the employed and unemployed.

### The USA

Lowest levels of government social expenditure, social provision more partial, redistributes less, leading to high poverty and equality in the developed world.

19th century America was a leader in state welfare but it lacked a reformed civil service so government corruption discredited these programs/.

The social security act of 1935 created a system of social insurance but due to the Southern resistance and racial hierarchies, its coverage was far from universal. Black people suffered.

Another legacy - new deal reformers chose to govern by imposing control on private action than building a national infrastructure of state agencies, leading to a distinctive regulatory state where a lot of private actors, market mechanisms and tax breaks is used to promote public purposes: the middle class became a supporter of private sector welfare and in alliance with employers has limited public provision.

This system is residualist, designed to supplement the market rather than displacing it - securing the middle class and alleviating extreme poverty whilst reinforcing market processes. Its expenditure comes to means-tested programs and tax credits, little to decommodification.

Market failures are designed to support the market than supplant it: there are few social or economic rights, unemployment benefits are time limited, social assistance is paid at low levels. People believe poverty stems from individual failure.

This, among liberal regimes, is an outlier - lacking basic programs like universal healthcare, family allowances, sickness and maternity leave benefits. It provides little public housing, public provision of services is minimal, public transport is underdeveloped, public assistance is patchy and public amenities is generally limited.

... laissez-faire.

... less regulation of the labour market leading to large low-wage service sector and large wage dispersion

... high levels of incarceration

.. high exposure to market processes.

The result is a stratified society of great riches and inequality, directed through private channels. The aggregate result is that America's net social spending is high but there are big differences in how this is spent, much of the welfare state hidden in tax credits, deduction and preferences, is regressive, going to wealthier households.

### Welfare regimes beyond the free world

Welfare states existed in Nazi Germany, Vichy France, Fascist Italy and more.

This three worlds typology is not comprehensive and does not fit neatly - look at Britain!

Britain wanted to be streamlined and universalist, using the NHS. It did not develop a corporatist style of economic management, little control of industry. Trade unions resisted corporatist agreements, preferring free collective bargaining and employers valued free enterprise. Post war governments did not use corporatist economic management but wanted good balance of power.

Thus - liberal.

UK governments failed to modernize the economy and growth was slow. Tightly constrained social spending. People became more affluent, flat rate low-level benefits ceased to be adequate income replacement. The NHS is an important exception, but even private healthcare was made there. Public services appeared like second rate provision to the poor, diminishing their political viability.

This shifted from a universalistic welfare state to a restrictive residuality regime that resembles the liberal US model - there are big differences but they look like each other.
