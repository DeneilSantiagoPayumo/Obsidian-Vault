[[Media, Social Media and Capitalism]]

We can learn a lot about major tech companies by taking them to be economic actors within a capitalist mode of production - abstracting from them as cultural actors defined by the values of the Californian ideology, or as political actors seeking to gain power. This places limits on our expectations of what is likely to occur - Capitalism demands that firms seek out new avenues for profit, new markets, new commodities, and new means of exploitation.

We can argue that the digital economy refers to those businesses that increasingly rely upon information technology, data, and the internet for their business models - an area that cuts across traditional sectors and is becoming important.

The digital economy is far more important than an analysis would suggest: in the first place, it appears to be the most dynamic sector of the contemporary economy. The digital economy appears to be leading light in an otherwise stagnant economic context.

Secondly, digital technology is becoming systematically important - pervasive, its collapse will be devastating.

Thirdly, because of its dynamism, the digital economy is presented as an ideal that can legitimate contemporary capitalism more broadly: the digital economy is becoming a hegemonic model: cities are to become smart, businesses must be disruptive, workers are to be flexible, governments lean and intelligent. Those who work hard can take advantage of those changes and win out.

The argument is that with a long decline in manufacturing profitability, Capitalism has turned to data as one way to maintain economic growth and vitality.

Data has become increasingly central to firms and their relation with worker, customers and other capitalists - the platform emerging as a new business model.

Today, the capitalism of the high and middle income economies is increasingly dominated by those firms - the aim here is to set these platforms in the context of a larger economic history and understand them as means to generate profit.

**The Long Downturn:**

I skipped straight to the conclusion.

We live in a capitalist society where competition and profit seeking provide the general parameters of our world. The 1970s created a shift away from secure business practices. This led to a new model of growth - leading to the bubble crisis.

Workers have suffered tremendously ... but thata's not the info I care about right now.

## Platform Capitalism

8

There has been a renewed focus, since 2008, on the rise of technology: automation, the sharing economy, endless stories about the 'Uber for X' and proclamations about the internet of things - receiving labels such as 'paradigm shift' and 'fourth industrial revolution.' We have new terms - gig economy, sharing economy, on-demand, industrial revolution and so on.

But what's really important? Data.
We must distinguish data from knowledge - data is information that something happened, knowledge is *why*. Data may involve knowledge but it's often not a necessary condition. Data may also entail recording.

Data must be sorted and cleaned into formats to be usable - the generating of proper algorithms can involve the manual entry of learning sets. The collection of data today is dependent on vast infrastructure - data is the new raw material, activities being the source.

Industries have risen to use data and optimise production processes, control workers, give insight to preferences, create products. There is just so much data.

Data serves many functions: to educate, give advantage to algorithms, enable coordination and outsourcing of workers, allow for optimisation and flexibility, make transformation of law margin to high margin and so on...

The problem is that old business models are not well designed enough to extract data - a different business model is necessary. Hence, platform capitalism!

Platforms became an efficient way to monopolise data.

What are platforms? They are digital infrastructures that enable two or more groups to interact - intermediaries. Users can build and maintain their own products - Microsoft's Windows operating system enables software developers to create applications for it and sell to consumers.

Rather than having to build a marketplace, a platform provides the infrastructure to mediate between different groups - a platform positions itself between users and as the ground upon which their activities occur, giving it privileged access to record them. Google, the platform for searching, Uber, the platforms for taxis, Facebook, the platform for social networking.

The second characteristic is that digital platforms produce 'network effects' - the more numerous the users, the more valuable that platforms becomes for everyone else. Likewise, the more users who search on Google, the better their algorithms become. This creates a cycle, having a tendency towards monopolisation and lending platforms a dynamic of ever-increasing access to more activities.

The ability to rapidly scale many platform businesses means there's no limit for growth - just more servers.

Therefore, platforms must deploy a higher range of tactics to ensure that users come on board.

The third characteristic - cross-subsidisation, one arm of the firm reduces the price of a good so another can raise prices. Google provides services like email for free but raises money through its advertising arm. Since platforms have to attract a number of different groups, part of their business is fine-tuning the balance.

Finally, platforms are designed in a way that makes them attractive - presenting an empty space, embodying politics: shaping the appearance of a market, predicting (for Uber) where demand will be and fall, creating phantom cabs to give an illusion of supply.

In their position as an intermediary, platforms gain control and governance over the rules of the game. In their position as an intermediary, platforms gain access over data and control over the rules of the game. The core architecture of fixed rules is that it enables on others to build on them, producing apps and plug ins.

Therefore, platforms are just a new type of firm. They are characterised by providing the infrastructure to intermediate between different user groups, displaying monopoly tendencies driven by network effects. All these characteristics make platforms key business models for extracting and controlling data, positioning themselves to extract data from natural processes.

Five different types of platform - in each area, the most important element is that the capitalist class owns the platform.

The first - advertising platform, extracting info on users, analysing it, and using the products of that process to sell ad space.

The second - cloud platforms, owning the hardware of digital businesses and renting them out.

The third - industrial platforms, turning traditional manufacturing into internet-connected processes that lower the costs of production and transforms goods into services.

The fourth - product platforms, generating revenue by using other platforms to transform a traditional good into a service and collecting rent on them.

The fifth - lean platforms, attempting to reduce ownership of their assets to a minimum and to profit by reducing costs as much as possible.

### Advertising Platforms

They emerged out of the dot-com bust - many competitors collapsed, elaving the tech industry under control of fewer enterprises.

The monopoly tendencies bloomed here.

The centrality of marketing to finance capital's 'growth before profits' strategy meant that dot-com firms had already built the basis for a business model orientated towards advertising and attracting users. They spent 3-4 times more than other sectors on advertising.

An argument: users are unwaged labourers who produce goods that are sold to companies.

Two rebuttals: all social interaction is free labour, work is inseparable from non-work. That said, not all of our social interactions are co-opted into a system of profit generation. Companies must compete to build platforms is because our social interactions aren't all captured.

Is this right to call this activity labour? Do we produce surplus labour?

Advertising platforms appropriate data as a raw material - revenue is gained from the extraction of data from user's activities online: the auctioning of ad space.

The more users interact, the more information is collected. As users wander around the internet, they are tracked via cookies. There is a convergence of surveillance and profit making in the digital economy.

They talk about Tesco.

What have these advertising platforms done with their revenue - investment growth remains low. One was to save it. The second was for mergers and acquisition. The third was to funnel money into tech start-ups.

### Cloud Platforms

20

Amazon - largest employer in digital economy, employing over 230k workers and many, many seasonal workers who do low-wage activities.

In the process of doing that, Amazon Web Services was developed - they found new services and rented it out to other firms, renting out cloud computing services. The utility is that they do not need to spend their time building up their own hardware system, but instead renting them on an 'as needed basis'.

### Industrial Platforms

- develop new products and design new features on the basis of usage data drawn from existing product
- Mass communication - chemical processing - customisation
- common standard for communication, industrial platforms link sensors, actuators, factories, suppliers
- economic competition that comes with this
- security, extracts data as a competitive tool, intermediatory between factories, consumers and app developers

### Product Platforms

- Music, for example, zero marginal costs
- On-demand platforms - durable goods like Rolls Royce, technological competition
- Raw data is central - sensors are placed on engines of planes and cars, massive amounts of data are extracted, combined with weather data and sent to a command system. This data is vital in blocking out competitors and securing a competitive advantage.

### Lean Platforms

- A regression?
- No, 'growth before model' - Uber, Airbnb.
- Specialised firms for a variety of services (cleaning, grocery shopping) to marketplaces like Taskrabbit.
- Asset-less companies.
- Hyper-outsourced model - everything is outsourced, workers, trianing, fixed capital.
- They outsource workers, calling them independent contractors - saving 30 percent on labour costs, outsourcing training, training permitted for employees only, controlling it through reputation systems, transmit the gendered and racist biases of society
- Contractors are paid by the task.
- Larger trend - see Nike, restaurants, gig-economy (that just moves this online)
- Bureau of Labour statistics in 2005 - 15 million US workers in alt employment
- Lean platforms? Helps independent contractors and freelancers. Sharing economy is just a small trend that is growing.
- After 2008, self employment is not a freely chosen path but a forced imposition.

Is there anything new about lean platforms?
Today, outsourcing extends to new jobs: haircutting, stylists, cleaning.
This enables businesses to cut costs by exploiting cheap labour, placing downwards pressure on wages by placing these jobs into global labour markets.

Lack of profitability led to cutting back on wages.
Also prompted companies to compete on data extraction - data about what drivers are doing are used to beat competitors.

These firms struggle to turn a profit. Money comes from outside.

Where? It is surplus capital seeking higher rates of return in a low interest rate environment. Low interest rates have depressed the returns on traditional financial investments, forcing investors to seek out new avenues for yield - building a technology boom.

The profitability is unproven. Growth is premised on expectation of future not actual profits. The hope is that the low margin business of taxis will pay off until Uber has gained a monopoly position.


### Conclusion

21st century data has found a massive new raw material to appropriate - the platform has become a dominant way of organising businesses to monopolise these data, extract and sell them.

The era of lean production modified this as JIT supply chains demanded data about inventories and supplies. Data outside the firm however is regarded impossible to attain. The platform has data extraction built into its DNA. All of these make platforms a central model for extracting data as raw material to be used in various ways, generating revenue.

This is intertwined with a series of long-term trends and short-term cyclical movements.

This group of exploitable workers have intersected with a vast amount of surplus capital set in a low interest rate world - tax evasion, high corporate savings, easy monetary policy - large amounts of capital seeks out returns.

Enabled by digital technology, platforms emerge as the means to lead and control industries - they have prominence over manufacturing, logistics and design, enabling a shift from product to service.

This is the concentration of ownership, not end of - 'age of access' is empty rhetoric. Significant platforms are building infrastructure.

## Great Platform Wars

Capital investment is not sufficient enough to overturn monopolies - so many hurdles to overcome Google. This is a shift away from competition over prices - competitiveness is determined by data and analysis.

Tendencies - expansion of platform driven by cross-subsidisation.
Platforms and tools are made for data extraction given that collecting and analysing this data is very important. Whoever gets there first wins. Companies produce assets enabling them capacity for gaining information.

This requires an extension of sectors - not asset-less companies, they spend billions of dollars to purchase fixed capital. Once we understand this, it becomes clear that demanding privacy or lobbying an end is impossible - suppression of privacy is at the heart of the business model, pressing against what is socially and legally acceptable.

Analysis is the necessary correlate. Google designs its own custom services - a competitive advantage!

A second tendency: expansion across the ecosystem around a core business segment is driven by the need to occupy key positions: mergers like rhizomatic connections driven by permanent effort to place themselves in key platform positions.

Google's search engine is monopoly - what about search engines through apps?

Natural language interface - chatbot? Preferred way to communicate? Users simply access them through Facebook's platform. The interface is dominated. 

Companies will expand to take over key positions - becoming a payment platform, building the base for making economic transactions. The aim is to occupy a position in the stack.

Platform expansion is driven by the need for more data: the convergence thesis, the tendency for different platform companies to become similar as they encroach upon the same market.

The third tendency: funnelling data extraction into siloed platforms.
This approach ties users and locks them through measures: dependency on a service, inability to use alternatives or a lack of data portability (see Apple or Facebook!)

Non-platform companies will be forced to use platforms to continue their business, putting pressure on platforms to lower prices and platforms fight back by making switching platforms difficult.

In the end - tendency of major platforms to grow to immense sizes thank to networks effects leads them to use enclosure. This will cause the internet to fragment.

### Challenges?

40

China - overcapacity, overproduction, dumping steel at low prices.
The industrial internet will give rise to some successful firms. Will this overcome the lack of profitability?

The industrial internet appears to drive prices down, increasing competition for market share, impeding global growth.

In this context, surplus capital will seek out return.

There is a lack of profitability - numerous firms have to cut costs and wages to remain profitable and the 'growth before profit' model dictates that taking high losses is just normal.

Lean platforms are reliant on a vast mania of surplus capital - investment in tech start-ups is less an alternative to finance just an expression of it, initiated and sustained by a loose monetary policy.

Advertising platforms are dependent on ad revenue - platforms use cross-subsidisation to build their empires. Google's portfolio is built on the profits made by its advertising services.

Advertising is not exempt from economic crisis - spending on ads dropped by 1/2 in Greece, 1/3 in Spain between 2007-2012.

Advertising is highly correlated with economic growth - it is cheaper than before. Can advertising survive in a world of ad blockers, fake views and more? Companies are struggling and it's hard to imagine an advertising arms race being key.

If advertising declines, what next? Enclosure? A shift of direct payment (rents, subscriptions)? Provision of essential platforms (a cut for each financial transaction, licence fee)? Micro-payments?

Businesses will be forced to develop novel means of extracting a surplus or fold their expansive cross-subsidising monopolies into traditional forms.

### Future

- Platforms continue to expand, competition drives them to enclose, they turn into direct payment businesses
- Lean platforms dependent on outsourcing go bankrupt
- Platform capitalism has inbuilt tendencies to move towards extracting rent by providing services - amazon is the future, and cross-subsidisation behind this public-facing infrastructure would end, existing inequalities would be replicated. Platforms would come to siphon off capital form companies dependent upon them for their productive processes.

States can control platforms - ban lean platforms, impose privacy controls. These neglect structural conditions.

Can we make public platforms? Offer platforms as public utilities? Wikipedia?

Panama papers?
COVID?
CHAT-GPT?
... skipping a lot until the conclusion is worked around.
