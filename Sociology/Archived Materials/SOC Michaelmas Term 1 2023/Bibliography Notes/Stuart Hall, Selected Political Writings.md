## A summary of the book:

This is an essay discussing the moral panic of mugging.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### History around how racism has been constructed

```ad-quote
"Here [late 1940s and 1950s], we find the build up of black workers in the labour-hungry centres of British production ... the main outlines of the pattern of black settlement are established in this phase: the density of black labour in specific occupational sectors."
```

#### First turning point: **Late 1940s and 1950s (Notting Hill Riots)**

##### **Patterns of black settlement are adjusted in this phase:**
1. High inner-city black concentration
2. Multiple occupancy
3. Density of black labour in specific occupational sectors
##### **Interactions between the black and the whites:**
1. Accommodation and adjustment is on the agenda
2. Black people take a low profile
3. The whole period of the 'open door' of British agenda: the government needed to draw on the new reserve army of labour and that weakens resistance between blacks and whites.
4. Rising living standards provides that economic space.

##### Three elements of the Notting Hill race riots:
1. The appearance of an active fascist political element, with the Unionist movement and the League of Empire Loyalists that saw the area as a place of growing urban problems, leading to a native racism.
2. More importantly, the structured antagonism between 'colony' blacks and sections of the indigenous white working class and petty-bourgeoisie of this decaying 'royal' suburb.
3. White teenagers, with the picture of black and white youths locked in confrontation leading to a moral panic about the process of post-war social change.

#### Second turning point: 1964, Smethwick, the Midlands

##### Location:
1. Peter Griffith's campaign on black immigration marks when racism is appropriated into the official policy and programme of a major political party and legitimated as the basis of an electoral appeal ... the beginning of racism as an element in the official politics of British populism (149)
2. Revealed the degree of which everything that happened to the Labour party is vulnerable to popular racism.

#### Third turning point: between 1964 and 1968, across the world, specifically 1968

##### Features:
1. Rise of black struggles - black separatism, cultural underground, beginning in Britain and migrating
2. Politics of the centre dissolves and reveals the contradictions and social antagonisms - the state and dominant class perceive an organised and active conspiracy against the social order itself.

###### Powellism:
This is the formation of an official racist policy at the heart of British political culture.
Mr Powell's pronouncement on race was clear - talking about a conspiracy of radical and alien forces threatening the society, the 'enemy within.'

###### A crisis of authority: 
The 'crisis' of British society is thematised through race, "Race is the prism through which the British people are called upon to live through ... to deal with the growing crisis." (150)

This ideology has now become a real political force that connects to people's lived experiences - given a concrete purchase on people's lives. "When the 'silent' ... majorities ... are made to 'speak' through the ventriloquism of its public articulators, it is not surprising that it 'speaks' with the unmistakeable accent of a thoroughly home-grown racism." (151)

Then, the identification of black crime with mugging, the syntax of extremist versus moderates becomes identified - not a set of discrete panics about race, but the total. People turn to hysteria - beginning of attacks on black centres, cycle of unemployment.

Young blacks drift into petty crime and pilfering due to unemployment, resulting in extra policing with increasing strictness. It has to be ideologically dealt with so the "Blacks become the bearers, the signifiers, of the crisis of British society in the 1970s: racism is its "final solution". The class which is called upon to bear the brunt of a deepening economic crisis is divided and segmented along racial lines." (152)

The language of racism has the effect of connecting the state to the people.

This draws heavily from Stan Cohen's book around moral panics. The three features, as quoted:
1. It represents a way of dealing with what are diffuse and often unorganised social fears and anxieties
2. It projects the fears onto an indentifiable social group and provides them with an object
3. It forces the authorities to take action

"Moral panics ... serve as ways of pioneering practices by the state which ... increase effective social control." (155)

Race is just one element of this crisis, grounding in obvious facts and draws distinctions of what we call natural. Race provides the simplifications that help deal with troubling developments: who wants to explore the tissue of political forces that have sustained poverty?


### The issue around racial debates from both the left and the right

```ad-quote
There is a tendency to abstract questions of race from what one might call their internal social and political basis and contexts in British society - that is to say, to deal with 'race' as if it has nothing intrinsically to do with the present 'condition of England'. (143)
```

There is a problem to assume that only the right aren't capable of racial ideology. "For the 'right', immigration and race has become a problem of the control of an external flow ... the liberal 'left' on the other hand, have long treated race and immigration as a problem in the exercise of good conscience': be kind to 'our friends from overseas' - then racism will disappear. Neither side can nowadays bring themselves to refer to Britain's imperial and colonial past. (143)

These relations have been central features in the formation of Britain's material prosperity. The wealth - drawn off through conquest has enriched the English class.

The development of an indigenous British racism in the post-war period begins with the profound historical forgetfulness - a loss of historical memory, a kind of historical amnesia, a decisive mental repression. The native, home-grown variety that I want now to turn.

First, it's necessary to establish some kind of rough periodisation: we must look sequentially at the way in which racism has been constructed and developed, and it's important to look laterally at what are the other things with which this developing racism has occurred,

# **A collection of key ideas**

## Ideology (273-282)

Here, this looks at the implication of black people as people of crime to save Capitalism from crisis.

Hall quotes the Sunday Times - "Among the incipient ghettos in Britain today, Handsworth, Birmingham displays the classic symptoms: poor housing, a strained education system, households struggling to make ends meet, and few social amenities." 

In 1970-72, the 'year of struggle', mass unemployment and living standards ceased to rise and made it difficult for the ruling class to govern by consent.

There was student militarism - "rise in the proportion of offences in which firearms were used", an evocative account of "mounting, often carefully organised public hysteria" of student protest within Warwick and Cambridge.

"Race was being used to mystify and confuse the people. The real target was the great liberal conspiracy, inside government and the media, which held ordinary people to ransom, making them fearful to speak the truth for fear of being called 'racialist', and 'literally made to say black is white.'" (276)

"The state itself has become mobilised - sensitised to the emergence of the 'enemy' in any of his manifold disguises; the repressive response is at the ready, quick to move in, moving formally, through the law, the police, administrative regulation, public censure, and at a developing field." (278)

This law and order campaign of the 1970s legitimised and led to war - leaving to conflict as the only effective means of defending hegemony. "It toned up and groomed up the society for the extensive exercise of the repressive side of state power. It made this routinisation of control normal, natural and thus right and inevitable." (278)
