Good introduction - good at signposting, good shape. The only thing to think about in the story, related to the reading list and to the assessors is to be thinking of perhaps the possibility of bringing Michel Foucault primarily because he is a big influence.

Nice work bringing in Gilroy and Halls. There was an opportunity to name these angles. Fredrick Engles.

Even though my introduction is excellent, especially those last sentence "then I'll explore another form of coercion of x..." Might want to get more clear and cohesive there as what I'm basically saying is that the ghetto is a site of abjection and criminality. Territorial fixation piece (Wacquant) is important as we can't colonise and enslave people as long as we don't get fixated on the territory we wish we owned and the territory we're thieving from.

We bridge here the politics of race and policing. At that end point, talk about the ghetto about a territorial fixation, a place of punishment and inherited from enslavement. And that's how it distorts the positive functions of any positive community because it fixates on the actual space and seeks to criminalise it without acknowledging the colonisers and how they committed the original sin.

Foucault study (takes a look) - *crime and punishment*, Foucault, a very short introduction. He talks about how disciplining ends up being the ways in which marginalised groups see themselves.

[Review: Foucault's "Discipline and Punish"--An Exposition and Critique on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/828299) - Garland reviews Crime and Punishment

The language of black criminals and enslavement becomes a language power, simplistically straight forward and brutal - she gives a different understanding of social control. You discipline and normalise the idea of black criminality. Disproportionately treating them badly, in this case the penal system becomes a technique for control - where the prison becomes justified as a piece of machinery as part of modern forms of power and has a way of engaging in Foucault's primary control of biopolitics - the idea that we need to engage in population management. 

Basically when we finish that introduction we can bring the next part of that essay and racial abjection and profiling that leads to the normalisation of punishment directed against black Americans - now Latinos, Latinas who come from the global south who come from the free trade zone or more. This gives us the crux of my argument, and then we can talk about what we mean by institutions and then we can talk about different perspectives: this angle on power and the penal system and what forms of powers are at work - how structure and culture comes together to shaping inequalities through the penal system.

Black Atlantic slave trade - Gilroy
Colonisation - Hall

The question - how do these things come together to create populist moral panics, how does the government drive through power and a certain notion of power - the dark phantom of the nation - not just the penal system and stuff, but how the angle shifts.

We can talk about Gilroy's black criminality and racist ideology and talks about how power but also subtle forms of control that we learn to trust like knowledge making and criminology. For example, how we regulate student's imaginaries - different spheres of this powerful influence.


Two different conceptualisation of power: Garland comes from a Foucauldian point of view and how power is governed and normalised - 'the bad subject' - coming out of the birth of modernity, we can have homogenous citizens and there are others. Modern individuals will sort this out. Population management mechanisms. All others can be punished legally - another person who might be useful can be {Mbembe) - come across him in SOC2. Talking there in more detail. We've got the Garland perspective and now we would be following it by Foucault's arguments who talked about the penal system.

Others see they are being punished - a way of sorting society. It is a biopolitics sort of governing, sort of disciplining mechanism. It's important to consolidate that and say a different angle, looking at race, colonialism and culture and then we have the Gilroy piece.

Might want to have an example that is more contemporary - including what happened when white people kill black people, Stephen Lawrence murder (1996) with institutional racism. Bring an example close enough to us to show that we understand how the theory is working through the example.

Wacquant is important. We are in a position here to return back to the introduction - here's what Wacquant is saying, here is the real history, it is the state who is criminal, the state is not recognising the historical violence - how can there be a black ghetto without segregation? This comes out of segregation policies, by the way let's return to my original argument and drive that down.

Conclusions are tough - "As I have argued" not scoped, ghetto assign criminality without recognising the history.

Drive the conclusion slightly differently. We have made the argument, can be altered slightly.

What about questions and assumptions? We want to be clear and direct. Reminder: the distinction between an assumption and a criticism. What are they missing? One, this is my first point. In a situation with a more authoritarian government, you are more likely to be duped - because of the information you are getting, you are allowed to criticise the systems themselves. Therefore, context really matters. Black lives matter campaign. Where does Foucault or Garland's view fit then? It fits to the degree to those who believe they are already powerful use the modes of social control they are being dictated by.

Should navigate those criticisms like that.

Last criticism: perhaps the theories themselves and the studies themselves, one of the limitations is a lack of (avoiding on focusing on black criminality but "the problem with some of these approaches is that they're only focusing on the penal system and policing and black criminality as a form of social control, but what other forms of power might be at play can influence the ways in which black criminality is at play.")

Stuart Hall - the conjectural space in which unexpected things come together at the same time to create a series of problems that leads to an event, 

Goyle (PHD students) - a lot of the kids in and out of prison are because the Philly ghettos are seen as incarceration, seen as prison. (https://www.nikhilgoyal.me) What forces may be at play? What does racial bias really look like? I took up the suggestion of ways forward, but that's a nice way forward but another thing to look back is: what other disciplines could be useful.
