## Lecture notes:

## Topic one: legitimate rule

[[Max Weber]] defines Authority as "the probability that a command with a given specific content will be obeyed by a given group of persons." - Weber 1921.

What makes authority legitimate?
Authority is legitimate to the extent that **social conduct is oriented toward it** on the basis of a belief that the authority's commands are "**binding on the individual**" or **correspond to behaviour "worthy of imitation."**

Legitimacy rests on the shared recognition of its rightness and that its commands are binding (where 'binding' refers to a belief that others will also observe the commands).

"There can be orientation toward valid authority even where its meaning ... is not necessarily obeyed. Thus, the thief's behaviour exemplifies the validity of the criminal law merely by the fact that he tries to conceal the conduct."

## The Types and Bases of Legitimate Authority:

1. Tradition / Convention - an "established belief in the sanctity of immemorial traditions and the legitimacy of those exercising authority under them."
2. Charisma: "resting on devotion to the exceptional sanctity, heroism or exemplary character of an individual person."
3. Rational / Legal - resting on a belief in the legality of enacted rules and the right of those elevated to authority under such rules to issue commands.

This change from traditional to charismatic to legal-rational authority is a reflection of modernity.

## What is the state?

States provides healthcare, picks up tax, educates you, provides functions for society.

For Weber, you can't define a state in what it does because all kinds of different institutions have done all those kind of things. Therefore, we can only talk about its legit use of force.

"The monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory"

In Weber's definition: a state:
1. Is a compulsory political organization with continuous operations
2. Cannot be defined by its ends since organizations have it
3. Must be defined to the means peculiar to it
4. Sucessfully claims monopoly on the legitimate use of violence within a given territory.

```ad-quote
title: Violence and force
"It is understood that **the use of physical force is neither the only nor even the normal method of administration of political corporate groups**, but the threat of force ... is **the method which is distinctive of political associations and is the method of last resort** when other methods have failed."

Weber, *Basic Concepts in Sociology, p. 119-120*

## What makes a state modern?

The Weberian view - transition to rational-legal basis of authority.
Bureaucratization - hierarchy and specialization of functions and depersonalization of authority.
Territory represented by fixed borders.
State integration into society

### Warfare-centred theories of European state formation (aka the Tilly thesis)

By the 15th-16th centuries, intensifying warfare between rival elites in Western Europe led pre-modern states to raise standing armies and hire mercenaries.
The rising costs of warfare led states to extract more money and human power from their territories.
Fiscal and organizational imperatives of war gave rise to institutional innovations, like centralized governments, bureaucracy and taxation.
Faced with taxation and mass conscription, non-elites demanded more from the states.

"War made the state and the state made war." - Charles Tilly, Reflections on the History of European State Making.

### Economy-centred theories of European state formation

By the 17th century, capitalist developments in some Western European countries saw the rise of a capitalist class, mostly landowners and merchants who demanded the state:

1. Guarantee property rights and contracts and protect landlords from angry peasants.
2. Open new markets through imperialism and warfare.

Capitalist development provided "core" states with resource necessary to make war and to colonize in the periphery.

In order to compete in inter-state rivalry, late developing states played 'catch up' stimulating capitalist development through rapid modernization.

### State formation: outside Western Europe, some considerations.

The intensity of inter-state warfare in Europe was unique:
- In East Asia, feudal kingdoms and empires spent more time fighting external threats (from North and Central Asia) or internal wars than fighting each other for territory - corresponded to a hierarchical tributary mode of rule centred on imperial power.
- Look at Africa! (add notes later)

The existence of "core" states in Europe shaped trajectory for others. For example,
- After independence in the 19th century, Latin American states could borrow capital from Europeans states to finance war, relying less on taxation. This simultaneously led to high levels of debt while precluding development of a strong fiscal bureaucracy.
- In colonial Africa and South Asia, imperial authorities exported certain institutions and logics of governance from European states. This was pronounced in the process of partition wherein sovereign borders were drawn around these new post-colonial states.

Who rules the state?

### The Pluralist Perspective on State Power.

[[Dahl]]'s Who Governs?
- Power is dispersed rather than concentrated.

Pluralist democracies, organized interest groups aggregate and represent the political preferences of their constituencies. Their actions influence policy decisions.

Government agencies, legislative and regulatory bodies are conceptualized as targets of interest-group influence. Government entities can act as interest organizations by participating in coalition or directly pressuring other government units.

Focus on political parties, electoral coalitions, civil society organizations, and lobbying. Not one of them is hegemonic.

### Marxist Perspective

"The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoise."

What is the role of the state in Capitalism?
1. Since market forces themselves cannot secure all the conditions needed for capital accumulation and are prone to market failure, there is a need for some mechanisms standing outside and above the market to underwrite it and compensate for its failures.
2. Economic and political competition between capitals necessitates a force able to organize their collective interests.
3. This state is needed to manage the many and varied repercussions of economic exploitation within the wider society.

 "Bob Jessop. 2004. "Developments in Marxist Theory." *The Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology* p.10"

First, we have the instrumentalist view - that the capitalist are in charge.
	"By virtue of their economic resources, members of the capitalist state are able to control the state (whether directly by holding office or indirectly by dictating office"
	Business elites and political elites tend to share the same class position, thus common interest and loyalties.

Then, we have the structuralist view - the state is capitalist.
	The state depends on capitalist development for revenues
	The state has an interest in the growth of capitalist accumulation
	Thus the interest of the state and the interest of the capitalist are aligned

## Feminist Perspective

"The liberal state coercively and authoritatively constitutes the social order in the interest of men as a gender - through its **legitimating norms**, forms, relation to society and substantive policies. The **states formal norms recapitulate the male point of view** on the level of design."

She is discussing the liberal state, a state made to protect the private rights (**negative rights**) of individuals, not to correct social inequality - for MacKinnon, the legitimating norm of the liberal state is non-interference of the status quo.

And the status quo is male domination.

```ad-example
title: *Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes (2011)*
They sued Walmart for discrimination.
However, they got rejected by the Supreme Court for not being a class because they all hadn't been injured in the same way.
It was just 1.5 million cases of women individually being injured, not altogether.
