## A recap on the welfare state:

Hidden homelessness - concealed households, more than one household occupy a dwelling occupying one household.

## Is the welfare state a racial state?

David Garland talks about the several activities of the welfare state - social insurance, social assistance, publicly funded goods / services, social work and 'the hidden welfare state'

[[David Goldberg]] argues that all modern states are racial states - "race marks and orders the modern nation-state, and s state projects, more or less from its point of conceptual and institutional emergence." All states are racialized as race marks and orders all modern racial states and their projects, to their constitutional arrangements.

The Welfare State apparatuses, policies and 'technologies of the state' helped fashion and modify means of subjugation and the terms of racial expression - how racial groups are bordered and the hierarchy that makes them. Racial states become engaged in the constitution and management of 'whiteness', a form of European domination. Even states that are 'colourblind' are racial states - it follows that white states produce manage and sustain the conditions of relative power, privilege, and property of the whites.

In a society that is hierarchically ordered according to racial groups where whites have lots of capital, states reflect this power structure - [[Mackinnon]] argues that the state is male, Goldberg argues that the state is white. So long as the society is structured around sexism and the hierarchy, Goldberg makes a similar argument for race.

To it, the racial state is racial because of the structural position they occupy in producing or effecting racially shaped spaces ... inclusions and exclusions and more. The experiences people have in the world are structured by state, and so as long as states produce this racial hierarchy and structure, states will be racial.

Is the welfare state a racial state?

The New Deal Coalition - the new deal is considered the founding of the US welfare state, during the 30s the Great Depression, the US state is confronted with mass unemployment and poverty. As a result of the depression, the government made an ambitious policy agenda that set out to accomplish: a stimulation of the economy (think Keynes!), eradicate poverty, wage control, social insurance programs and more.

Let's talk about the southern democrat: who were white, mostly exported cash and tobacco, liked low tariffs and enforced society through Jim Crow laws - racial segregation. "Preserving the autonomy of local state structures from national interference ... built on the twin pillars of planter dominance and racial disenfranchisement."

To bring them on board, the Roosevelt government were forced to make concessions that would protect these labour practices of the South. They preserved institutional structures: 

Robert Lieberman (1998) Shifting the Color Line: Race and the American Welfare State, p. 24:
 *“Southern society combined labor-repressive agriculture with racial disenfranchisement and segregation to subdue African-Americans both economically and politically. 
 Southern politics placed a tremendous premium on preserving the autonomy of local state structures from national interference, and these local political structures—built on the twin pillars of planter dominance and racial disenfranchisement—were constructed particularly to serve the elite white employers of African-American labor.”*

*The 1935 Social Security Act excluded farmworkers and domestic workers (among other occupations) from eligibility for the public pension system. These jobs accounted for 90% of Black workers in the South. As a result, 65% of Black workers were ineligible for Social Security.* 

The ability to exclude African-American from benefits has been a central factor in the adoption of national [welfare state] policies.

The Home Owners' Loan Corporation had racial practices of redlining: [[Blacks and the Racialized State]]. You know about this.

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) helped to improve home ownership to Americans but at the same it had a huge impact on racially shaping private markets and entrenching black subordinations regardless of their work ethic. If you can't get a loan to buy a house, it becomes difficult to get a home loan. It leads to an intergenerational transmission of disadvantages.

## In the case of the United Kingdom and austerity

Austerity did not make a racial state a racial state. It just transformed the ways racial-ness is described. At least from 2010, it is totally race-blind: you can't look at the budgets that the racial state passed and find anything inherently discriminatory for this social program. In fact, the austerity state is cutting back on programs that are on the reserve for these people. You can almost imagine the austerity state as equalizing: one could think that austerity cuts us universally half.

[[Austerity and Extending the Racial State]] - is council housing is for people of marginalized communities, and the austerity state wishes to remove social housing as a stock of housing and push people onto the private market it will have.

```ad-quote
title: Gargi Bhattacharya 2015 Austerity and Extending the Racial State
"In what sense can it be argued that the austerity state is a racial state at all? The phraseology and techniques of austerity appear to be insistently post-racial..."

The extension of the privations previously concentrated among the racially marginalsied to increasingly greater sections of the population could be itself be regarded as a twisted version of the post-racial.

```

Other things: austerity states retain a race-neutrality in official language but it embeds practices of disempowering and often cruel differentiation. The subsequent differentiation is built by the state for the purposes of disentitlement on the machinery of racialised categorisation and exclusion or containment.

## The Penal State: Social Control and Punishment

David Garland suggests, in *The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society* that:
	"Prior to the 1970s, "The institutional foundations of the crime control field - the specialist institutions of police, prosecution, courts, and prisons - were more than 150 years old [in Britain and America].
	Overlaying this was a more recent modernist superstructure, created during the course of the twentieth century with its distinctive correctionalism motifs and the specialist arrangements that supported them.

The result was a hybrid penal-welfare state structure, combining liberal legalism of due process and proportionate punishment with a commitment to rehabilitation. 

The basic tensions that underly the field between penal aims and welfare aspirations, principles of law and criminological assumptions, police function and social work missions, offenders rights and public interest were tensions knotted into the working arrangements and conceptual promises that make up the fabric of any practical institution.

The functions of the state coevolved in response to similar pressure - to control surplus population displaced by capitalism and industrialization. In liberal democracies, the state's capacity to impose 'law and order' came to be viewed as a contractual obligation owed by a democratic government to its law-abiding citizens ... one of the key public benefits conferred upon the people by the state and its agencies.

It was believed that the state was capable to winning the war against crime.

The system was far from perfect but it enjoyed:
1. Governance logic - embodying a style of social governance that relied upon norms of social expertise
2. Informal social control - provided informally by families, school, workplaces
3. Economic conditions - penal welfare policies were favourable to welfare provision

As reported crime rose in the 1960s, there was a rise of penal populism - political discourse around crime that was emotive, relied on symbols of perpetrator and victims, questioning the efficacy of rehabilitation.

New Right politicians, moving under New Democrats and New Labour, criminal justice policy turned towards more intensive policing.

But rising crime rates and the political outcry were only proximate cause of a transformation. The transformation of the criminal justice system was an adaptive response to the cultural and criminological conditions of late modernity ... the political culture that articulated these social relations was ... more exclusionary than solidaristic.
