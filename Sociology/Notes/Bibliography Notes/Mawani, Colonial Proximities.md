Elements of this book:
-  Interracial encounters between aboriginal people, Chinese migrants and enemies provoked deep concerns between colonial authorities
- Colonial administrators sought a delicate balance of moral assimilation for aboriginal populace and physical segregation of Chinese settlers

Fear of racial encounters created accusations of prostitution to threaten colonial morals, heterosexuality regulated social norms of inhabitants.

Paradoxical blend of assimilation and segregation intersecting the salmon cannery industry.

Aboriginal women seen as internal danger to the colony.
Chinese women were racial enemies who threatened the racial balance of its white populace.
Liquor provisions augmented racial division - illegal liquor trade augmented racial divisions by fortifying existing power structures, illegal liquor trade exacerbated accusation of Chinese selling liquor to aboriginals.

Created racial anxieties that sustained colonial institutions run by Indian agents, missionaries and legal authorities who sought ways to monitor these encounters.

Heterosexual relations between aboriginal women and white men were viewed as obstacles to white settlement, objects of state attention.
Half-breeds passed and defrauded prerogatives of white privilege.
Complained that Indians were endangered by geographic nearness to 'half-breeds'.

Under the *Indian Act*, the taxonomy became legally certified - mixed-bloods were not considered Indians. Restricted access to reserve land, voting privileges and other rights.

Officials determined who was 'white' and who was 'Chinese' but were less sanguine in their efforts to identify Indians from half-breeds. Ambiguity provoked repeated questions and heated disagreements. 

Skin symbol of racial otherness. Crime and criminality powerful indices of racial difference - "the putative criminality of native populations was mobilized to differentiate between colonizer and colonized and to sustain broader racial hierarchies amongst colonial populations." (497). Fused with assumptions of tutelage, assumptions, segregation, racial and geographic distinctions. Criminalised alcohol under the Indian act, and rendered Indians to have tastes that were already criminogenic.

"Fears of crime and criminality were also activated by Indian agents and local authorities to highlight racial excesses and to differentiate Indians from half-breeds." (ibid)

"The racial opacity and resolvability of mixed-race peoples opened spaces of mobility as well as sites of resistance and subversion. But it was precisely their invisibility that provoked demands for new modes of recognizability and added optics of surveillance." (501)

"In British Columbia, local authorities became increasingly anxious that a racially diverse colonial populace might eventually subvert plans to build the region into a permanent white settlement colony. Racial encounters between aboriginal and mixed-race peoples, Chinese migrants, and Europeans, as well as the physical proximities between these populations both in labour camps and in urban locales, created new opportunities for friendships, political alliances, and intimacies of other kinds." (8)

"It was precisely the putative differences between racial types (Indians, “half-breeds,” Chinese, and whites) that enabled colonial authorities in British Columbia to create racial taxonomies and to assert hierarchies of colonial power. Racial comparisons naturalized the myth of European superiority, but in so doing they also rendered some populations to be worthy of imperial improvement and progress and others to be expendable. " (11) 

"As I discuss in the following chapter, the demands of global capitalism encouraged intimacies and encounters that were both sporadic and patterned; aboriginal women and men, along with their Chinese and white male counterparts, laboured together in the salmon canneries, socialized, and forged a variety of intimate and political relations during the work day and in nonworking hours. These encounters and the apprehensions that underwrote them prompted colonial agents to develop a repertoire of comparative racial truths as well as a series of legal and spatial modalities of governance. Although the latter were not always successful, they were aimed at reinscribing racial boundaries, discursively, symbolically, and materially. Importantly, the management of encounters across racial divides was motivated by biopolitical concerns over the life and longevity of white settlement. In drawing racial boundaries, colonial agents not only forged distinct races or populations but also marked out and politicized a continuum of good vs. Bad, superior vs. Inferior, and fit vs. Unfit “species,” identifying those who might enhance or inhibit the settler population – those whose lives were worth cultivating and those who needed to be expunged and how" (15-16)

On Foucault:
What Foucault charts at the close of the eighteenth century is the rise of what he terms “a ‘biopolitics’ of the human race.” An extension and interpretation of discipline, this articulation of power is novel in that it focuses not only on maximizing the capacity of the body (via development and self-government) but also on fostering and maximizing life. Whereas discipline is individualizing, aimed at creating “docile bodies,” the biopolitics of governmentality, Foucault insists, is massifying, aimed at enhancing the biological life of the “species.” These changing political objectives inspired interventions aimed at “protecting the purity of the blood and ensuring the triumph of the race.”67 Importantly, Foucault explains the shift from sovereignty to biopower as one of convergence and complementarity: “I wouldn’t say exactly that sovereignty’s old right – to take life or let live – was replaced,” he clarifies, “but it came to be complemented by a new right ... It is the power to ‘make’ live and ‘let’ die. (17)

"Through the contradictory objectives of improvement, civilization, segregation, and assimilation, the Indian Act spanned questions of ethics, schooling, and marriage, directing “Indians” on the virtues of cultivating the self and on the appropriate conduct that these interventions prescribed. At the same time, the law provided Indian Agents, police constables, and other colonial officials with a considerable degree of sovereign power to intervene in the minutiae of aboriginal peoples’ lives and to punish those who defied the objectives and practices of colonial governance."
