# The Dignity of Working Men: Morality and the Boundaries of Race, Class, and Immigration.

## Before we continue
### What is it about?
#### How is the book organised and what chapters are more heavily studied?
The central objective of the first part of this book is to analyse the mental maps of American working men, to identify which social categories they perceive as violating moral norms, and to explore why they see them as such. More broadly, I examine how workers construct similarities and differences between themselves and other groups - how they perform boundary work.

This book identifies the principles of classification and identification that operate behind workers' evaluation of worth and perception of social hierarchies. How do they define us versus them?

In the second part of the book, we look at the American working men through comparative lenses and discover that nothing is inevitable in how they draw boundaries - defining their worth and dignity through morality but giving different meanings.

#### What are the key takeaways from this book?
We explain differences in boundary ideology by the cultural resources that people have access to and the structural conditions in which they are placed.

Workers assess the world in moral terms and this results in different patterns of social boundaries in France and the US. However, there are two subplots: one to do with cultural differences between American and French working men and their upper middle class counterparts. I consider whether workers share the culture of the upper middle class, how workers have a distinct moral code focusing on personal integrity and quality of interpersonal relationships. Second, I analyse the relative worth of race in the context of their discussions

## A collection of key ideas from the text
### The World in Moral Order
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

This chapter aimed to scope out the patterns of thinking that black and white working class men held. Overall, this chapter is **not important to our study of boundary creation**. However, some points are listed below:

**(Everything below is paraphrased and taken from 52-54)**

Workers live under a moral code. They define who they are and who they are not. It is important for them to preserve this self-worth and dignity. Our cultural-materialist explanatory framework suggests that the structural conditions in which workers lives account for dimensions.

Both races value honour and hard work. They have very little buffer space from other people. In an environment they perceive to be as being threatened from the influence of others - drug addicts, drunks, racist people, the image of control and security is a strong influence on their psyche.

For blacks, this takes a special importance: protection is incredibly important. They live in areas of crime and disorder so this causes them to draw a stronger moral boundary. They are more willing to put the 'caring self' over the 'disciplined self' - emotions such as generosity, kindness, care. In contrast, whites are more individualist and are less exposed to cultural repertoires that can sustain solidaristic norms. The norms from black workers are fabricated from different cultural material and exposed to harder structural conditions.

Morality too holds an important criteria more-so for workers than professionals and managers, suggesting that conceptions remain distinct.

### Euphemized Racism: Moral qua Racial Boundaries
#### What were the key points of this chapter?
##### Intro
Middle class people tend to feel superior or inferior around income and educational and occupational success. By contrast, workers read these questions in regard to race.

Moral and racial boundaries and white workers repeatedly and spontaneously referred to blacks when drawing moral boundaries. This pattern holds when black workers discussed whites, although their racial boundaries are weaker. Both groups define their opposition to each other in terms of us versus them. (p, 57).

These racial feelings appear justified in their eyes as these criteria are universalistic.

- Moving from moral to racial boundaries
- The disciplined self versus the caring self
- Similarities in the rhetoric of anti-racism
- We are witnessing the movement of the disciplined self over the caring self.
- Reproduction of racial inequality.
##### What norms do whites feel like blacks are violating?

For these white workers, their perceptions of African Americans take their meaning against the backdrop of their own incessant efforts to struggle for survival. In their view, this situation is unbearable because "not giving up" is so central to their own senses of self. They underscore a concrete link between the perceived dependency of blacks, their laziness, and the taxes that are taken from their paycheck.

Whites also cite special privileges associated with affirmative action perhaps the most contentious policy issue which the American racial drama is played. Whites view it particularly unfair because it is essnetial to their class identity as essential to their class identity as they believe that it differentiates them from the middle class: they rarely get a break and no one is trying harder to pass on advantages to them.

The central role of work performance in the racial attitudes of whites is also supported by the claims of whites who argue for the equality of the races. They say that they have real respect for blacks who know their job and pull their weight,
```

```ad-quote
title: 66, later 67
If white workers are so anxious about black violation of moral boundaries, it is in part because, as shown in Chapter 1, they feel that their work is threatened on various fronts simultaneously ... these threats affect not only workers' economic and social position, as is generally suggestedm but their general sense of social order. Workers often condemn the moral failings of blacks in the same breath that they lament the downfall of democracy.

White workers frame their own racism in patriotic terms when they argue that blacks threaten what is good about American society.

My white respondents explain racial differences by a mix of natural, historical, psychological, and cultural arguments. Several suggest that laziness is aprt of the "nature" of blacks or comes from a culture that is so deeply ingrained and rooted in history that it is not easily changed and is passed on from one generation to the next in an almost unalterable manner."

```

Thus, they are able to feel as though they are not racists whilst making racist arguments: avoiding feelings of responsibility toward the disadvantaged while defining themselves as whites - that is, disciplined and moral.

There are also a wide spread of non-racist arguments - they argue that earning capacity makes people equal. Additionally, non-racists argue that good and bad people are found anywhere. Note that very few concepts of multiculturalism exist here which people believe to be a key antitode to racism.

##### Black on whites.

These men share with the white nonracists a belief in the universality of human nature. however, they also have to confront the fact that the principles of 'stomach equality or 'common human nature' do not translate into equal treatment, They turn to arguments having to do with market performance (as producers and consumers) to ground equality, making worth conditional on individual achievement and class. They also mobilize criteria of evaluation related to the "disciplined self" valued by whites, suggesting the pervasiveness of the criteria whites take to be universal.

```

From competence, to a heavy focus on money - these workers put less emphasis on production than consumption as evidence of equality. Todays work allows them to access consumption. 

```ad-quote
title: 80
In sum, blacks describe whites as nosy, competitive, disciplined ("reading and sitting," "studying"), domineering, sneaky, manipulative deceiving, and intolerant, but they describe blacks as more accepting, caring, tolerant, straightforward, egalitarian, and fun-loving.
```

They fine tune the identities and value the aspects of the self that they perceive whites as valuing less. "Hence, the white individualist, domineering and disciplined self is opposed to the caring black self." Other areas include: experiencing hardship and occasionally, genetics. (80-81).

```ad-quote
title: 82
These men "feel" a racial difference and this feeling comes out of their understanding of their everyday experience and the repertoires to which they have access - such as those provided by the black nationalist movements - as much as from the need to rpeserve their dignity and integrity.
```

Other: blacks use religion, common physiology and status as Americans to attack racism. 83-85.

"Within this culture of particularism, black workers think of racism as a universal and unavoidable phenomenon, and this reinforces a zero-sum approach to group positioning: dominant groups will always maximize their position to the detriment of others, and this will occur whether whites or blacks are "on top.". (87)

##### Attitudes towards immigrants (88-93)
Immigrants are rarely mentioned surprisingly. Attitudes lacked intensity, are inconsistent and are ineffectively articulated. This contrasts with the author's discussion of racial boundaries.

For immigrants to be accepted, there's typically a narrative that they must adopt the American identity - a democracy, the land of new beginnings and more. For those workers that draw boundaries, they are concerned about their desire to assimilate: the newly arrived should give up a portion of their ethnic identity.

```ad-quote
title: 93
"To conclude: workers do not define "people like us" in clear opposition to immigrants. In interview, most were indifferent to them. Other held relatively positive views of this group. A few had more negative views and focused exclusively on language issues as opposed to moral character issues."
```


### Assessing "People Above" and "People Below"

#### What were the key points of this chapter?

Moral values = 100-102

##### Whites evaluating "people above" (102-107 / 107-112)
Half and half of white people are positive and critical of these values.

**In terms of positive traits:**
1. Financial Success
2. Authority
3. Ambition

To satisfy aspirations is a key factor.
Meritocracy - necessary division of labour.
Ambition is equated with intelligence,
Having ambitions is seen as a middle-class trait.

**In terms of negative traits:**
1. Snobby nature: unable to 'be real' or 'be sensitive' - constantly fake.
2. Competitiveness: dishonesty where you're willing to 'screw' another person over to get ahead. Ambition can lead to violating morality, and those who 'miss all of life'

```ad-quote
title: 111
"Workers assert their conviction that high social status does not necessarily go hand in hand with worth when they emphasize the poverty of the interpersonal relations of the upper half and their lack of straightforwardness, their competitiveness, and their excessive ambition. By subordinating social status to what they perceive to be the "real" value of a person, workers create the possibility of locating themselves at the top of the hierarchy.
```

There is then a dissociation of money and wealth from worth and happiness.

**Alternative definitions of success: (112-116)**
Most literature frame job security and stability as more important to these men compared to upward mobility. In reality, they revolve around interpersonal relations and happiness. Other definitions seen are definitions that revolve around raising decent children or enjoying one's self.

When evaluating others in terms of interpersonal relationships, they are not proposing a socialist model - they suggest people are fundamentally equal and downplay economic success as a criteria of support.

##### Blacks evaluating "people above" (118-121, 122-129)
Similar to whites in many respects: valuing income, ambition, money as a racial equaliser and social status.

**Differences:** (117)
1. Likely to define success in financial terms and to praise ambition.
2. Convinced that their quality of life is inferior compared to the middle class, expressing middle class attitudes of 'leadership' and 'goal orientation'
3. Identify likely with the middle class

**Boundaries:** (117)
1. Draw moral, class and racial boundaries simultaneously
2. Treat white and middle class synonymously
3. Treat white and middle class as synonyms
4. Attribute less legitimacy to authority and more attuned to its worser characteristics
5. Less likely to equate high socioeconomic status with moral character because their own experience with racism contradicts the view that individual worth is reflect in a person's success

**Those who identify with the middle class**:
1. Theories on achieving success: middle class values of goal orientation, ambition and leadership, setting goals for oneself.
2. Compared to whites, place greater emphasis on leadership.
3. Are heavily concerned about money, see below.

 ```ad-quote
title: 119, 119, 120
"These black workers find no romantic appeal to their own positions, and they look at the other side of the fence as an unreachable ideal from which they are excluded by lack of education, lack of resources, and lack of contacts. It is in this context that the American dream has a particularly mythic power for them."

"In the context of worsening economic conditions in many African-American enighborhoods where drugs are readily available, hanging on to this American dream is particularly important for stable blue-collar workers."

"We saw that black workers take it [money] to be a basis for racial equality, a universals standard that allows them to be evalluated independently of their asctibed characterist. They take it to be the key to social membership."
```

**The moral flaws of the middle class versus a caring and collectivist methodology:**
1. Racial discrimination makes it difficult for black workers to believe in social status as a signal of moral character
2. Domineering and exploitative character
3. Selfish and lack of concern with giving back to the community
4. Middle class people have poorer interpersonal relationships as they lack loyalty towards their friends.
5. Lack of concern for others characterizes professionals

Black American workers are more militant to social injustice and are more millitant in pointing to exploitation at work. Exploitation is a recurrent theme for many of these black respondents. (125)

Black workers have a more negative view of power and authority than whites - tools based on abuse and violence. (126)

```ad-summary
title: 128-129
In sum, the definitions of worth that black workers offer are paradoxical. On the one hand, they prize finacnail success, consumption, goal orientation and leadership. On the other hand, they are particularly critical of the explloitative dimension of interclass relationships. They do not believe that social achievement correlates with moral character in part due to their experience with racial discrimination ... they position is more paradoxical than that of whites: they are less ambivalent than whites in their critique of money yet more critical of the exploitative character of the middle class. They point to middle class selfishness, suggesting that their critiques of the middle class draw heavily on collectivist themes discussed in Chapter 1.

```


Overall, the author terms this resistance as an unintended consequence of the dimensions of morality that workers value most: "moral criteria are important for these individuals because they live in dangerous environments where predictability is valued, personal buffering zones are scarce and interdependence is high due to limited physical space and resources." (129)

"The experience of racial discrimination leads blacks to dissociate moral from socioeconomic worth more readily than whites. They are more likely to understand money as a tool and a key to membership rather than as an indication of a person's moral value." (130)

##### Who are the people below?
Whites Who Are against "Looking for Something for Nothing" Types: (131-136):

They do not express solidarity toward the poor because of their faulty values Two categories are of scorn: those of wrong attitudes, and those  on  the bottom of the hierarchy.

**Welfare dependency, homelessness, and self-sufficiency: (132-136)**
1. People should be responsible and pull their own weight
2. They should be self-sufficient and not give up - keep material needs at bay.
3. Typically not accounting structural explanations - individualistic explanations

**Part-time workers** (136-138)
1. Working class men with stable employments distinguish themselves from part-time workers.
2. Rigid system of moral designation to evaluate them and to keep them at bay
3. Have low moral standards
4. Nothing but trouble

**Interpersonal altruism and the poor** (138-142)
1. A large majority of Americans believe too little is being given to the poor
2. Contradictory evidence in the literature - redistribution of income appeals more to workers, yet negative attitudes are frequent across the poor.
3. What we have among American workers are references to person-to-person assistance that resonate with this altruism
4. More concerned with measuring themselves with people closer to them, comparing how much money they make, the quality of the neighbourhood in which they live, who is smartest and more.

Blacks Who Are against "Nothing Going Nowhere" Type:

**Compassion and the structural understanding of poverty: (143-145)**
1. Black workers contrasts their own understanding of poverty with those of white or middle-class workers: understanding the structural understanding of poverty.
2. This disassociates moral worth and income and avoids stigmatizing the poor
3. Advocates compassion and social solidarity with the poor

**Tactical distance toward the poor: staying clear of "the hands that pull you down": (145-146)**
1. Black workers stigmatise the poor for their low moral standards - substance abuse, work ethic and responsibility and such.
2. Friends, neighbours and family in need can put enormous demands on one's resources and limit one's chances to "move up" - hesitating to become close tot hem for tactical reasons.

Socioeconomic success and moral worth go hand in hand, the former confirming the latter.

```ad-quote
title: 146-7
"When evaluating the pper half, most workers disentangle socioeconomic and moral worth. They accomplish this by (1) elaborating a detailed critique of the moral character of upper middle class people, mostly by pointing to their lack of personal integrity, lack of respect for others, and the poor quality of their interpersonal relationships; (2) adopting alternative definitions of wealth."

"We saw that more blacks than whites identify with middle class values and that, as compared to whites, blacks more highly value certain middle class attributes, such as leadership, goal orientation and money because they provide, and hep them demonstrate, social membership. However, blacks are more likely than whites to decouple economic scucess from moral character due to their experiences."

### The United States Compared

#### What are the key points of this chapter?

```ad-quote
This chapter has suggested that there are differences and similarities in what French and American workers define as morality. Most important, French workers more readily put personal integrity above meterial interest as they resist actively the profit motive, perhaps because of the infleunce of socialism combined with the greater security offered to them by a strong welfare state .... their moralistic rhetoric centers more around civility and respect for others than around traditional morality, in part because they associate the latter with Catholicism. Finally, like African Americans, French Workers put considerable emphasis on a collecitv edimesion of morality, solidarity,  which, as we will see, is valued by socialism and republicanism alike ...
```

### Racism Compared

#### What are the key points of this chapter? (211-214)

We saw that:
- "French workers constructed North Africans as violating their standards of worth. These immigrants are criticised for lacking a work ethic, sense of responsibility, and civility, and are described as parasites that have invaded the country." (211)
- In the United States, white workers defined blacks as the prime violators of morality while immigrants were less central from the boundaries they drew. This is the opposite in France.

Differences in anti-racism:
- Point to the moral principles of egalitarianism to rebut racial inequality, drawing on a conception of moral wealth whilst drawing on a the universality of human nature to demonstrate equality.
- They do not believe, however, in the market to make people equal: instead that people are equal despite differences in socioeconomic status. This is in line with their belief that the profit motive is a negative force that must be resisted.
- North Africans do not consider earning capacity to demonstrate racial equality - they are good people, who follow a 'straight path' and that they are good *because* they work.

```ad-quote
title: 213
"This chapter has discussed how available cultural repertoires shape national differences in the way racism is conceptualized. We saw that some French workers ground their racism in part in republicanism and that antiracists also draw on solidaristic traditions that emerge from this tradition as well as from socialism and Catholicism. In contrast, American racists and nonracists alike are more influenced by market ideology, as evidenced by teh fact that they ground racial equality ins ocioeconomic equality."

```

### Class boundaries compared

This chapter fleshes out the argument that French and American workers define "people like us" on the basis of different principles of division.

France: strong boundaries erected towards Muslim immigrants. They draw strong boundaries against the upper half whilst weaker boundaries against the poor.

In contrast to the US, the boundaries against people above are framed in terms of domination and exploitation. French workers are more likely to explain inequality by differences in levels of intelligence.

## Conclusion
### What are therefore the main arguments of this book?

The white American workers the author interviewed use moral standards to distinguish between "people like us" and others - distancing themselves from the upper half whom lack integrity and straightforwardness, and those they regard as domineering and lacking in compassion.

These moral standards provide workers with alternative definitions of success and perceptions of hierarchies of worth. While white American workers view socioeconomic status as an indication of moral worth, many abandon this standard when evaluating the upper half. In contrast, black workers draw stronger boundaries toward the upper half than the whites, identifying more with middle class values - their own battles with racism teach them that the most deserving do not get their rewards.

Postmodernist research claims that class is not a basis of identity - her research shows that it remains a basis for collective identity. Many workers define who they are in opposition to hierarchically defined groups and they identify with people who share similar living conditions.
