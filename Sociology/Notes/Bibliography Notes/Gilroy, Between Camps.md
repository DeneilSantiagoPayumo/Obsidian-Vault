## Paul Gilroy's Between Camps
COLLINS, PATRICIA HILL. “A Tale of Two Titles.” _Ethnicities_, vol. 2, no. 4, 2002, pp. 539–44. _JSTOR_, http://www.jstor.org/stable/23890190. Accessed 10 Apr. 2024.

CLAIM:
- Analyses race and racism by examining relationships between continental and colonial racisms
- Takes a stance against raciology - 'lore that brings virtual realities of 'race' to life'
- Camp thinking - fosters group-based identities that lead to exclusionary politics (benign choosing of sports teams in summer camps, ethnic strife, horror of actual concentration camps) 
- Traces the importance of camp thinking to colonial and continental European racisms

CRITICISM (by reviewer):
- Claims that 'race' isn't real or racism is a thing of the past
- 'for race' - colour blindness, advised to abandon fixation on race and racism and threadbare political strategies
- Racial ethnic minorities stigmatized for holding onto the colour line
- Minimizes the effect of American racism and ignores literature, underestimates the commitment of whites to maintain this colour line

CLAIM:
- Parallel equivalences
- Distinguishments and v.
- Hitler was not hostile to Indians (he kept Tibetan monks in Berlin!), extermination of whole people not a Nazi idea inherently.
- Camps not fixed, nor are they equal
- Israel versus Palestine
- Race can be reinvented in other terms - racial intolerance operates too successfully between camps even when the category of race is not invoked
