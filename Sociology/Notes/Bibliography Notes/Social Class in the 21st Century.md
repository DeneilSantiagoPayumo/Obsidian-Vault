# Social Class in the 21st Century
## Before we continue
### What is it about?
#### How is the book organised and what chapters are more heavily studied?
This book shows, focusing on Britain, how spiralling levels of inequality are remaking social classes today. This book understands how people themselves understand these divisions do they overlap with wider social,, cultural and political fractures? Can we understand distinctive social classes?

There are four parts of this book. I will focus on part three and four.

#### What are the key takeaways from this book?
This introduces the Great British Class Survey.

We like to think of ourselves as living in a democratic system, yet we know that people's 3 economic fortunes are strikingly different.

### Methods and Data Sources
#### How was this data collected?
GBCS.

#### What, if any, are the pitfalls behind how the data was gathered?
Not everyone who responds is representative: some people may not try to answer questions, and there is a skew of ethnic groups and kinds of members in ethnic groups. A high proportion of minorities who did the GBCS wer students and university graduates,

### Notes about other authors

Savage on [[Pierre Bourdieu]]:
```ad-quote
title: 49, 49-50
For much of human history, inheritance has involved the passing over of economic capital to one's kin: property, savings, tools, hierlooms. But Bourdieu argues that it is supplemented by another kind of inheritance, one associated with cultural capital in the form of educational qualifications. Well-educated parents pass on to their chuildren - knowingly or not - the capacity for them to succeed at school and university, and thereby get the sort of qualifications which help them to move into the best jobs...

Here, for Bourdieu, the gift is a  'reality that denies reality.' The minute we refuse to see gifts as altruistic and voluntary presents, but as self-interesrted devices to make us feel grateful to the gift-giver, then the gift loses its power ... here violence does not depend on physical coercion, but can take place when we accept domination. It marks the 'naturalization' of historical forces.

The transmission of cultural capital, howerver, is opaque and is necessarily masked in a language of meritocratic achievement and hard work. The importance of cultuire is therefore apparently denied in the very same moment that it operates. For Bourdieu, this opacity is a necessary  feature of the ability of cujltural capital to operate as a form of capital at all.
```

It is a mutable phenomenon - the "A-Level curriculum" now features canonical texts. It is a mutable phenomenon. Now, it may be the ease and grace in moving between different genres, playing with typologies that count as cultural capital. They feel more confident in dealing with institutions, advancing their causes, being assertive - those without such educational resources may feel underqualified or ashamed.

Not to mention, Bourdieu also elaborates on the importance of social capital - the range and nature of people's social networks Contacts can accumulate over time and may be a resource which can be mobilized to gain information about jobs, accommodation, exciting opportunities and so forth.

Criticisms of Bourdieu:
```ad-quote
title: 101-102
Firstly, Bourdieu's criticisms of 'elitist' culture hit home, to the extent that it has generated worries among those working in the arts themselves in relation to their role as cultural policy makers...

Secondly, we now live in a much more intensely 'cultural' world.

Thirdly, we have also seen the rise of a whole sweries of cultural activities which don't seem 'highbrow.'

Fourthly, in recent decades cultural appreciation has been massively transformed by globalization and flows of immigration which has eroded the appeal and signifcance of older classical forms of culture which used to be held up as the markers of national excellence.

### Chapter 3: Highbrow and Emerging Cultural Capital
#### What were the key points of this chapter?
**Before the discussion of 'new' culture capital**
- There are important differences between those who have more or less cultural capital. Working classes avoided overly artistic literature, enjoyed museums, there may be industrialists who enjoy lavish holidays or otherwise.
- Those with highbrow cultural also had cultural confidence, what Shamus Khan expressed as "ease", pride and assurance. Distinctive self-conviction and self-assurance.
- Belief in highbrow cultural taste - a social currency in which people differentiate between those who have it and those who don't
 
##### The primary cultural divide: engagement
Cultural capital can still very much be found today, but that it has changed its form.

```ad-quote
title: 106-107
We are not implying that those who are less well-off and have few qualifications have no cultural interests, or simply sit passively at home all day. Rather, their cultural engagement is likely to be more informal, more neighbourhood and kinship-based, and is hence less likely to be something based around particular leisure activities such as going to a museum. However, for those who are highly educated and better-off, attending such formal activities can become associated with a sense of being active and engaged, addig to their cultural confidence and assertiveness.

"The key issue at stake .... was their differing degree of conviction in the legitimacy of their own cultural activities."

```

Less well-off those like Imogen had interests that fell outside the categories talked about in the survey - salsa and tango dancing, lack of confidence exhibited by Fraser and Charlotte.

##### The secondary cultural divide: highbrow versus 'emerging' cultural capital.

(112) - "There is a picture of cultural differences which have a very direct generational, as well as class-based, dimension. The kinds of highbrow activities discussed by Bourdieu are now predominantly associated with older Britons, those who are middle-aged and above."

These oppositions are not neutral 'lifestyle choices' but also hierarchical in the way they differentiate from each other. The younger middle class are highly engaged in the with the world of contemporary music, computer games, social media and sporty but less in 'highbrow' culture." (112)

Thus there are two types of cultural capital: one that is high-brow and ojne that is emerging (113). "We are witnessing the rise of a 'hip' cultural capital associated with younger people. It too has its own infrastructure - social media, and in the bar, club and sporting scene, and might also be seen to be institutionalized in new professional workplaces and lifestyles which emphasize the ability to be flexible and adaptable." (113)

Now, cultural capital isn't just this: "there was a distinctive knowingness to this engagement, particularly in terms of making reference to popular culture." (115)

"Emerging cultural capital is therefore not about liking popular culture per se, but rather demonstrating one's skill in manoeuvring between the choices on the menu, and displaying one's careful selection of particular popular artists; through one's ability to pick, choose and combine the 'very best' of popular culture. Moreover, this type of popular discernment was not just about *what* you like, but *why* you like it." (115)

Respondents were noted to have to sum up why he liked certain things - a set of aesthetic principles are applied in order to assess quality and value. "Herein lies the power of emerging cultural capital. This may be expressed by consuming the 'right' kind of popular, legitimate pop, so to speak, but equally it may be about consuming the 'wrong kind'" of (vulgar) pop culture in the *right* way." (118)

##### Ways of Seeing
 "The ways of seeing is important because it can be directed, implicitly or explicitly, against those who are less well-off and who have less formal education. For such respondents cultural enjoyment was not something that needed labour or detachment, or which required a display of judgement, On the contrary, culture was there to be completely and unapologetically immersed in, for instance, as a kind of escapism which allowed you to 'time out.'" (120)


### Chapter 4: Social Capital
#### What were the key points of this chapter? (160-161)
#####  1 Firstly, social networks are not exclusive.
Most people know someone from a fundamentally different walk of life. It was rare of respondents not to be able to identify anyone they knew socially who had an occupation vey different from theirs. It is important to bear this in mind, as it testifies to genuine openness in social networks and explains why people might not think that we live in a closed-up class society.

##### 2 patterns in social capital
Secondly, we can also see a strong tendency for those who know professional and managerial people to tend also to know other kinds of professionals and managerial people, and those who know people in manual and routine jobs to know other people in these kinds of jobs.

##### 3 we can also see that the extremes are distinctive
On one hand, the very wealthy have really distinctive social ties which make them proportionately much more likely to know other very advantaged people than any other group. This is evidence of a degree of closure and exclusiveness at the top of the social structure, indicating that forms of economic capital intersect closely with social networks to produce a pulling-apart from the rest at the highest levels of the social hierarchy. And we can also see that those who have no educational qualifications are much less likely to know anyone from any of the other occupational clusters.

These are all in all mutually reinforcing elements. (167)


### Chapter 8: Class, politics and the socio-cultural landscape:
#### What were the key points of this chapter? (276-297)

"If we focus specifically on the three indicators which provide the most powerful indices of advantage in British society today (household income, status of social contacts and high cultural capital), the dominance of London and the south-east becomes absolutely undeniable." (291)

"This matters because it has become one of the most tired tropes in mainstream public discourse in this country that power is disproportionately concentrated in the south-east region, yet metrics to highlight the intersection between these complex circuits of influence and interaction have remained elusive." (291-295)

"What comes out of our analysis therefore is a complex geography which operates across several dimensions : urban-rural; north-south; and the metropolitan capital of London versus the rest. All these divisions ultimately articulate the central power of London itself." (295)

"We live in a highly inegalitarian society, where macro-level policies are either inadequate or unable to counter the wide and widening disparities between the rich and poor. It is little wonder, then, that those inequalities are reflected at lower spatial scales as we peel back the layers of the onion and dig down through the geographies. Our country is economically dominated by one city, the economic power of which far outweighs even its massive demographic supremacy. Yet, spatial inequalities exist within all our cities, and the geographies of affluence and deprivation are too multifaceted to be explained by simple north-south binaries." (296)

## A collection of key ideas from P4 of the text:

### Chapter 9: The View At the Top 

#### What are the key points of this chapter?

"The contemporary elite class defies traditional 'upper-class' presumptions. It is a differentiated and heterogeneous formation, which is nicely captured by the idea that it is a constellation, which  lacks a unitary defining feature, but the definition of which arises from the interplay between tis different stars. Thus, its cultural motifs vary and it does not conform to a simple highbrow norm." (317)

Members of this elite class mark their distinction by being in tune with contemporary and popular culture, with younger members in particular also enjoying video games, contemporary music and so forth. (318)

Additionally, occupational diversity.

"London is not just the single incubator for the elite, a unitary zone which cultivates and nurtures people on their way to the top. It also contains distinctive zones in which different members of the elite constellation find their residence - testifying again to a degree of geographical concentration of this class." (320-321)

When the new class can distance themselves from the aristocratic old class, they can create a modest place for themself marked by meritocratic motifs - elite private education is no longer concerned with schooling a predefined aristocratic elite, but meritocratic skills and practices need to get ahead.

### Chapter 10: The Precarious Precariat
"The precariat world is therefore one in which people are 'knowing' but it is nonetheless also one which recognises how people are placed on the receiving end of other people's definitions and initiatives. Such perspectives colour the everyday experiences of urban life."

"Consequently, the precariousness here is about the pace of change, and the lack of security families have in finding and staying in work that will pay the ever-increasing rents." (342-343)

Turning to Richard's account: a man who said that he doesn't go to museums, galleries, classical music and such. Is he ignorant or unsophisticated? No. He was skilled in his knowledge of how classifications operate in order to produce results, but these were ones in which he was being positioned and had limited over to contest.

The classification methods were revealing: they gave thoughtful and interesting answers and enjoyed thinking about the things they liked and should do more of. They're engaged in these activities. (348)

"Asking this question about going to the opera was always embarrassing  for everyone, interviewers and interviewees alike, since everyone knew what was really being asked: whether they could claim to be middle or upper class. Going through this part of the GBCS with respondents, therefore, was very difficult. This became even more embarrassing when the next question on the survey was about bingo, known to be culturally pigeon-holed as working class and plebeian. This is how cultural capital works within people's lives: cultures of classification and hierarchization proliferates and thereby can be used to create and reproduce elitism and stigma." (350)


### Chapter 11: Class Consciousness and the New Snobbery

"Yet the uncomfortable truth is that the sneering of Hopkins (and those whispering parents she mentioned) may not be so anomalous. Hopkins was, in a sense,, saying the unsayable, identifying class boundaries and voicing sentiments (which are the more powerful for normally being unsaid) about them." (387)

"Yet we have shown here that this was not the whole story. While most people in Britain might not directly identify with a particular class, the extent of inequality, and the way that it shapes people's life chances unequally means that class is still felt in people's identities. Most people continue to identify strong markers of class..." (387-388)"

"We live in a paradoxical world, then. The public disdain the idea of snobbery and class prejudice, but this is very different from its real eradication. Indeed, what people say about class on the one hand, and how they actually enact and perform class in their everyday lives on the other, are very different." (388)

### Chapter 12: The Old New Politics of Class in the 21st century

5 elements:
1. A questioning of the stereotyping of those in the lowest rank of the social-class hierarchy
2. We need to bring those at the very top more directly into view.
3. We need to make the question of accumulation of different kinds of capital - economic, cultural and social more central to our understanding of social divison.
4. We need to unravel more effectively the way that contemporary inequalities are associated with the interaction of different kinds of capital, and which lead to a range of vicious and virtuous circuits.
5. Limits of meritocratic politics.

Two problems:
1. There lies the challenge laid down by Piketty - increase of inequality, no increase in inequality will serve any meritocratic function
2. Meritocratic processes do not address inequalities int he prospect of different social groups and accentuate them.

Elite educational institutions succeed not because they are in the pocket of the former aristocratic elite (though, of course, old habits die hard and it is still possible to find traces of this), but because they are at the apex of highly competitive recruitment and training processes which lie at the heart of contemporary neo-liberal capitalism. It thus follows that calls for more education as a means of encouraging social mobility and addressing class inequalities have considerable limitations in the face of growing inequalities witnessed in recent decades.
