# Rethinking Modernity: Postcolonialism and the Sociological Imagination

## Before we continue
### What is it about?
#### How is the book organised and what chapters are more heavily studied?

The first section of this book addresses both the general shifts in European traditions of thought during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as well as contemporary critiques.

The first chapter - absence of the colonial encounter and its implications
The second - the history of Sociology and its subsequent development as a discipline (not covered here)
The third - looks in more detail at the sociological construction of modernity and traces the development from modernization theory to multiple modernity.

The second section of the book examines the dominant discourses around the key historical events in the formation of modernity.

The fourth - Renaissance. No.
The fifth - the role of the French Revolution in the emergence of the modern nation-state. No.
The sixth - the development from commercial to capitalist society, the assumed ruptural aspect of the industrial revolution that is regarded solely as European phenomena. No.

The final chapter - conclusion

#### What are the key takeaways from this book?

There has been constant debates about modernity that rest on two assumptions - **rupture** and **difference** - a rupture that distinguishes a traditional past from the modern and a fundamental one that distinguishes Europe from the entire world.

In this book I call into question the socio-historic evidence for ideas of rupture and difference and examine how the construction of this evidence has led to the development of particular forms of theoretical understanding.

A misconception: intellectualism belongs to the West. The West is still seen as a leader of change. There is a need to reconsider the conceptual framework of modernity from a wider spatial and historical context, *one which regards the very concept of modernity itself as problematic*.

I challenge the privileging of the West as the 'maker' of *universal history* and seek to develop alternatives from which to begin with the questions once we reject this categorization.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### 1 Modernity, Colonialism, and the Postcolonial Critique
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

Discuss the emergence of postcolonialism and the nature of the challenge it poses for standard approaches to social theory. By addressing the relationship between colonialism and the politics of knowledge production. This will be followed by a discussion of the emergence of Subaltern Studies as a particular manifestation of postcolonial histography ...

Postcolonialism should not be understood as simply the latest version of a critical engagement in social thought. [[Kwame  Anthony Appiah]] ... It is a post that is a market of going beyond theoretical understanding of the world.'

"The colonial relationship, as I have been arguing constituted one of the fundamental relationships between Europe and its posited 'others' and yet, as Hansen suggests, there has been very little systematic work done..."

"I would argue more forcefully: that, whatever Europe is, cannot be understood *outside* of its imperial relationships ... while the modern idea of history denies 'that the colonizer are at least as much affected by the ideology of colonialism" as the colonized and implicitly accepts the cultural superiority of the colonizing powers, Nandy argues that what needs to be acknowledged are the ways in which the oppressor and the oppressed are turned into 'co-victims' through their encounters." (19)

"Colonialism does not enter into the general categories of modernity nor the broad historiography that is modernization theory ... It is even given a marginal role in the sociological histories of particular western countries which had pronounced colonial past." (20).

"Even where the processes of decolonization and liberation have transferred *political* power to the formerly colonized, the institutional, economic, and cultural contexts of Western hegemony have largely remained in place ... As a consequence, we must be aware of finding ourselves in the contradictory predicament of seeking to criticize hegemonic interests while working within 'relationship that are determined by the context of those ... interests'" (21)

"Colonialism ... was intrinsic to the contemporary scene in which dominant forms of inquiry were formed and yet the colonial is rendered unseen. These forms of inquiry elaborated universally relevant and yet ... Were constructed on the basis of marginalizing and silencing other experiences and voices." (21-22)

Written history has been seen as linked to cultural memory, and therefore providing proof of the existence of the ability to reason. Without it, it was believed there was no humanity. This led to, in the 19th century, the British Orientalist discourse on India was characterized by the assumption that India did not have the types of materials with which the West had constructed its own history and it was believed that they were called upon to provide India with a history. (22)

"The construction of India as a 'child' also had the effect of placing contemporary India in a direct relation to Europe's past." (23)  "Born through the force of military occupation and the appropriation of dominant processes of representation, the British were thus able to subsume the diversity of Indian pasts under 'a homogenizing narrative of transition from a medieval period to modernity'." (24).

"The nineteenth-century historiographical turn from narrative chronicle to documentary record had established the archive, and the documents that constituted it, as the repository of truth. As Foucault suggests, the document had come to be seen 'as the language of a voice since reduced to silence' and history was 'the work expended on material documentation' to render vocal that silence..." (26). History is produced.

"The bias of these texts, for our purposes, does not reside simply in the bias of their authors, but in the refusal of historians to *demonstrate* what appears to obvious in them; the bias is in the failure to acknowledge the contestability of the archive and to regard it simply as a neutral repository off acts which can be pierced together to construct History without sustained examination." (27)

Link with [[Nancy Hartsock]] - it is women's particular disadvantaged and oppressed position within society, or within the sexual divison of labour more precisely.

"The importance given to the subjective experience of oppression gives way to a recognition of the different mechanisms and *structures* of domination. With relations of domination and subordination not restricted to any one domain." (30)

"If the dominant cartographies of Western historiography have been effectively criticized by postcolonial theorists, as I have suggested in this chapter that they have, postcolonial historiography has nonetheless reproduced some equivalent hierarchies in its own representations of history from the point of view of the subaltern." (33)

### 3 From Modernization to Multiple Modernity: Eurocentrism *Redux* 

#### What were the key points of this chapter?

"The "unfinished project" in general terms, however, is the bringing to fruition of what is already predicated in the Western experience. Ideas of evolution and progress are central to the concern with the future and, for most writers, as I have argued, the history of the West is seen as a precursor  of the future of the non-West." (56)

Modernization theory took as its idea of change the standard notion of a linear movement from a traditional past to a modernized future. Traditional, or pre-modern societies were put forward as objects of comparison with societies already deemed to be modern and their problem was set up in terms of accounting for the historical transition from one to the other." (57)

"Globalisation is understood in terms of the world *becoming* global through the process of incorporating other parts of the world into a system whose defining features drive expansion forward, but are essentially defined independently of interconnections that are argued to come in the wake of globalisation. In this way, modernity is frequently identified as a feature of the West that is exported and has an impact on other societies, which then incorporate and institutional forms while adapting them within local conditions and cultures." (58)

Ideal types, which most theories are based on, abstract these modernities from wider interconnection in which they are embedded.

"Much analysis of modernization rests on an implicit (and often explicit) assumption that 'the highest of modern institutions must inevitably be those that have been devised in the West' ... And thus, evolution towards modernity was to be evolution towards Western ways." (61)

"The paradigm of multiple modernities does not go very far in transforming the previous debate over modernization. One reason why this is so is that the theorists of multiple modernities use a rather crude version of the modernization thesis, as set out by Kerr, Bostow and Lerner among others, without adequately acknowledging the considerable modifications that had been introduced by its critics at the time." (64)

By using ideal types, we implicitly make Western civilisation a common denominator against which to analyse ideal types - it is the very nature of ideal that the processes they represent are internal and separate from those represented in other ideal types. (72)

"What this understanding fails to acknowledge, however, is that, in its construction, the 'ideal type' refers to the 'real' but is then posited as a conceptual 'truth' that exists abstracted from its particular history and location and is deemed to be applicable as a heuristic in all situations." (73)

"I argue that there is an urgent need to address these interconnections as opposed to reifying the entities that are supposed to be connected, all the while keeping in mind "that what we are dealing with are not separate and comparable but comparable history." (76)

"Interrogating the colonial inheritance is not only about arguing for a critical perspective on European forms of knowledge; it also about problematizing the very assertion of forms of knowledge as European. This must be done through the use of global archives, geographies, and histories that would allow us to see that the theories and ideas we use were not created by a culture diffused from a centre which then impacted on the world, but through the interconnections of processes and paradigms that are themselves continually in negotiating and development." (77-78)

## Conclusion
### What are therefore the main arguments of this book?

"The conceptual categories of sociology, I have argued, are dependent on a particular historical understanding, but have been argued to be timeless, or universal, in character. I have argued that the categories are not universal but embody a form of Eurocentrism" (145).

"The once standard philosophy of science sought external standards against which the contingent claims of the social order could be tested, more recent philosophies, however, have increasingly called this understanding into question. Knowledge has come to be regarded as inherently social - that is, 'communal, interconnected, interdependent, and relative to larger blocks of things known and projects undertaken' - and thus, the legitimacy of knowledge is produced and constrained through these things and through the socially constructed  standards of the communities of which we are members."  (147)

Knowledge is not infinitely susceptible to contemporary invention - there are sets of norms within societies. Such norms, inhere to all societies and thus whilst anything could be possible, only some things are permissible - this aspect of plausibility guards against the lapse into relativism.

Connected histories is an approach that rethinks our current current circumstances and the trajectories of change associated from multiple perspectives rather than a dominant European one - what I have argued throughout then is that understanding interconnections in the present will require understanding them in the past and re-constructing our understanding of the past. (153-154).

The problem with sociological accounts is that they want something outside the dialogue which does not determine the substance. It has given up on a standard positivistic account of agreement on substance but wishes an analytical agreement on concepts.

These concepts are bound up with the acceptance of a particular substance - that substance is Eurocentric. What is problematic is that it is considered the condition of dialogue rather than what is engaged with in dialogue. (155)
