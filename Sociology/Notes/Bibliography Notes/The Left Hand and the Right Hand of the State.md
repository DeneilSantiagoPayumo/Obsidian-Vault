Bourdieu (interview) (1992):

Bourdieu defines:
- Left hand of the state as the social struggles of the past (agents of the so-called spending ministries)
- Right hand of the state - technocrats, public and private banks and ministerial cabinets (revolt of minor state nobility versus senior state nobility)

The left hand of the state has the sense that the right hand does not want to know what the left hand does, and does not want to pay for it.

"One of the main reasons for all these people’s despair is that the state has withdrawn, or is withdrawing, from a number of sectors of social life for which it was previously responsible: social housing, public service broadcasting, schools, hospitals, etc., which is all the more stupefying and scandalous, in some of these areas at least, because it was done by a Socialist government, which might at least be expected to be the guarantor of public service as an open service available to all, without distinction ... What is described as a crisis of politics, anti-parliamentarianism, is in reality despair at the failure of the state as the guardian of the public interest."

Governments have power in the symbolic:
"But it is difficult not to have doubts when one sees not only examples of corruption (sometimes quasi-official, with the bonuses given to some senior civil servants) or betrayal of public service (that word is no doubt too strong – I am thinking of _pantouflage_3) and all the forms of misappropriation, for private purposes, of public property, profits or services – nepotism, cronyism (our leaders have many ‘personal friends’ . . . 4), clientelism."

Symbolic profits: "Television has probably contributed as much as bribery to the degradation of civic virtue. It has invited and projected on to the political and intellectual stage a set of self-promoting personalities concerned above all to get themselves noticed and admired, in total contradiction with the values of unspectacular devotion to the collective interest which once characterized the civil servant or the activist. It is the same self-serving attention seeking (often at the expense of rivals) which explains why ‘headline grabbing’5 has become such a common practice."

Politicians?
This is probably because the professionalization of politics and the conditions required of those who want to make a career in the parties increasingly exclude inspired personalities - [[Max Weber]]
