# Towards a theoretical synergy: Critical race theory and decolonial thought in Trumpamerica and Brexit Britain.
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
This article argues for a theoretical synergy between critical race theory (CRT) and decolonial thought. The author propounds that while CRT and decolonial thought have different scopes, we can synergize them in analysis. Specifically, decolonial thought’s transnational focus on coloniality complements CRT’s ‘presentist’ focus on national racialized social systems. The author displays the efficacy of this theoretical synergy by discussing Brexit Britain and Trumpamerica. While CRT is helpful for analysing how these political projects built upon contemporary post-racial ideology and racialized emotions, it struggles to deal with the postcolonial melancholia that runs through both political moments. Decolonial thought is thus required to tease out the transnational, historical dynamics of coloniality embodied in Brexit Britain and Trumpamerica. This is particularly apparent in the way both projects involve a desire to return the nation to its imperial glory, and to keep those who are deemed to be opposed to Western civilization – particularly ‘the Muslim’ – outside of the nation’s borders.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

We must look at critical race theory and decolonial thought - we can synergize these traditions by discussing both political projects. CRT fails to discuss the postcolonial melancholia, which in line can be combined with decolonial sociology.

Important thing to note - we should not equate a sociology of race with a sociology of decolonisation. Decolonial sociology focuses on challenging structural issues and sexism.

Decolonial thought is transnational and largely historical, seeking to trace the epistemic and material consequences and realities of coloniality. Critical race theory does not focus on imperial relations or adopt this transnational thought.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Operationalizaiton

The author uses Bonilla-Silva's (1997) conception of CRT. 

Racialized social systems refer to ‘societies in which economic, political, social, and ideological levels are partially structured by the placement of actors in racial categories or races’ (Bonilla-Silva, 1997: 469). Racism is thus conceptualized as a material structure of inequality, involving the unequal distribution of societal resources across the racial hierarchy.

Decolonial scholars use the concept of coloniality to signal how the relations of power born in colonialism outlived the collapse of colonial administrations.

```ad-quote
title: Maldonado-Torres (2007: 243)
[Coloniality] refers to long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of colonialism, but that define culture, labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge production well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations. Thus, coloniality survives colonialism.
```

Historical events are hereby linked with contemporary inequalities - how the west positioned itself as the dominant centre of the globe even after the decolonization of most of the world.

```ad-quote
title: 650
In contrast to CRT, therefore, the concept of coloniality links the historical events of colonialism with contemporary inequalities. Such a continuity between the past and the present is well typified by how ‘the West’ has consistently positioned itself as being the epistemologically and materially dominant ‘centre’ of the globe even after the decoloni-zation of most of the world. Thus, the logic of coloniality underlying the West’s mission to ‘bring civilization’ to the rest of the world during colonialism hundreds of years ago, is precisely the same logic that underlies more recent Western economic, political and military intervention in the ‘unruly’ Global South. As Grosfoguel (2017: 158) thus describes the past half-millennium."

```

This creates a methodological difference - one reason why CRT is so appealing to scholars in the United States is because it provides immediate critiques to the status quo. By contrast, decolonial thought embraces a historical thought that denies that the present exists as a discrete temporal event. It is simply a wider scope than CRT (650).

CRT focuses on an analysis of educational institutions that eludes the possibility of transnational enquiry - guilty of methodological nationalism. Decolonial thought unearths global interlinkages.

The author explains [[The Imperial Origins of American Policing, Militarization and Imperial Feedback in the Early 20th Century]]

```ad-quote
title: 651
Contrastingly to CRT, decolonial thought unearths global interlinkages. For instance, consider the case of the militarization of the police in the US – a key issue in contemporary racism. As Go (2020) shows, such militarization of the US police started in the early 20th century primarily as a means of punitively surveying and controlling the racially sub-dominant. However, the tactics used by this police – such as the creation of mobile squads and police intelligence divisions – derived from US military practices in its colonies (Go, 2020). In this regard, Go’s (2020) decolonial approach creates not only a temporal link between a contemporary issue of police militarization with its historical origins, but also a transnational link between ‘racism at home’ with US ‘imperialism abroad’ in a way that transcends CRT’s bifurcated understanding of racialized processes.
```

### Trump, Brexit and CRT

CRT helps explain how Brexit Britain and Trumpamerica were fuelled by racialized emotions and ideologies. (652). 

Central to this framework is that racial ideologies are not about deception but perception - racial ideologies set paths for interpreting information. The ideology of post-racism is a framework through which people view reality that allows people to explain racial inequality as a result of non-racist events.

```ad-quote
title: 653
Both Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the campaign for Britain to leave the EU in 2016 played upon such post-racial schemes of perception adopted by many white vot-ers. In particular, both campaigns cultivated arguments that whites were becoming vic-tims of racial injustice in their respective nations. Such representations of whites as racial victims only makes sense through the lens of post-racialism; by arguing that we have moved ‘beyond racism’, whites are able to paradoxically claim that all racial groups start on an equal level playing field, and consequently that any perceived preferential treat-ment given to racialized minorities (affirmative action, preferential hiring, educational scholarships) is thus anti-white.
```

We can see this in [[Hochschild]] 's (2016) Strangers in Their Own Land - examining how white people were experiencing deprivation and blamed these declining standards on 'line-cutters'.  White people construed themselves as being stigmatized through being labelled as 'red-necks' and 'bigoted'.

[[Lamont]] et al (2017) explained how Trump drew symbolic boundaries towards lower-income white voters to make them feel valued - drawing divisions between indigenous white folks and racialized outsiders.

Trump's campaign thus fostered an image that 'hard-working' white families were being excluded in their own nation and that political programmes could restore valuation to these groups (653).

This post-racialism underlying 2016 electoral campaigns was left in British discourses deployed in garnering voter support to leave the EU - leave campaign.

```ad-quote
title: 654
Similarly to the US, therefore, Brexit was presented as a project that could redistribute value back to the victimized, hard-working white families whose social status had been relegated by racialized immigration. In Britain, this narrative gained further traction afterthe referendum, when the Prime Minister, Theresa May (2017), declared that Brexit was an opportunity to build a Britain that values residents of the (almost exclusively white) towns that voted in high numbers to leave the EU, thus addressing the ‘everyday injustices that ordinary working class families feel are too often overlooked’.

This legitimacy of post-racialism and emotions of victimhood were further bolstered by mainstream media and political discourse in the aftermath of Trump’s and Brexit’s electoral success. Rather than framing these two projects as instances of racialized nationalism, focusing on the two project’s significant number of (white) middle class supporters, or questioning why racial minorities in both nations did not significantly vote for either project, this discourse simply gave further credence to the idea that Trumpamerica and Brexit Britain were driven by a need to redistribute value to the for-gotten ordinary white families and the white working class (Bhambra, 2017)
```

CRT brings a lot to the analytical table when looking at Trumpamerica and Brexit Britain. 

```ad-summary
title: 655
"In particular, CRT enables us to see that both projects stemmed from their respective racialized social systems, within which many white people are viewing their realities through the lens of post-racialism, and experiencing emotions of devaluation. Trumpamerica and Brexit Britain effectively rode this wave of post-racialism, fostering emotive bonds among ordinary, 'indigenous' whites who were increasingly feeling alienated in their own country. The electoral success of both projects merely deepened the legitimacy of those already existing racial ideologies and emotions." (655)

### From racialized social system to postcolonial melancholia

```ad-quote
title: 655
Central to Trump's campaign, for instance, was the argument that the US used to be a global superpower, but that this imperial greatness had been taken away from the nation. Trump's campaign, therefore, was not only committed to giving back valuation to white citizens who felt marginalized in their own country (as CRT shows), but also giving valuation back to the nation *on a global scale*  (which decolonial thought can show). 
```

656, paraphrased - therefore, what occurred in Trump's arguments "are attempts by Trump to reinscribe the coloniality of power, and the coloniality of knowledge." *and* to make the US the central *knowledge producers* in the world system. 

```ad-quote
title: 656
"The empire, therefore, is a source of national pride as it supposedly signals Britain’s unrivalled work ethic, philanthropy and esteemed civilizational values. Indeed, it was this little Englander spirit and conviction in self-determination that allowed Leave campaigners to argue that the EU eroded the strength of British governance."
```

The Brexit campaign created its own imagery of Britain being a European colony that allowed MP Anne Widdecombe to describe the decision to leave the EU as a 'slave revolt'.

"Britain has an imperial nostalgia *because it believes that its empire was a force of good* ... It was for this reason that during the Brexit referendum, Leave campaigners consistently argued that Britain would be economically sound post-Brexit because they would return to their free trade arrangements with Commonwealth nations." (657)

"Just as with Brexit Britain, Trumpamerica positioned the nation as having its 'sovereignty' challenged by the current world order and argued that it could restore a collective 'pride' by returning the nation to its former imperial glory. Furthermore, similarly to Brexit Britain, this nostalgia omits histories of colonial violence." (ibid)

Thus comes orientalism - the idea that Islam is an antithesis to progressive Western values (658).

```ad-summary
title: 658-659
Such political mobilization around the figure of ‘the Muslim terrorist’ and ‘pre-modern Islam’ in the Brexit campaign was epitomized by Farage standing in front of a billboard picturing male Syrian refugees, with the caption ‘Breaking Point: We must break free of the EU and take back control’. Such imagery, just as with Trump’s electoral speeches, successfully moulded a centuries-old discourse of Islam as the inverse to the West – a discourse seen in Marx and Weber’s dismissals of the Muslim world as pre-modern and static, and used by the French and British to justify their colonization of the backwards North African and ‘Eastern’ worlds – and applied this discourse to the current political moment. Such a discourse has roots in the logic of Western modernity, and while it was applied in contemporary political projects, it would be a mistake to analyse it as a con-temporary innovation of Western thought. This is another reason why decolonial thought, which links the past to the present, and focuses on the enduring logic of coloniality, can capture dimensions of our current political projects and predicaments that CRT struggles to reach with its presentist focus. Thus why, to come back to the theme of this article, I am calling for a theoretical synergy between CRT and decolonial thought.
