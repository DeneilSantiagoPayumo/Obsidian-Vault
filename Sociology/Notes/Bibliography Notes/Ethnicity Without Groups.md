## Common Sense Groupism

164 This paper aims to identify groupism - the tendency to take discrete, sharply differentiated, internally homogeneous and externally bounded groups as basic constituents of social life, chief protagonists of social conflicts, and fundamental units of social analysis,

Really, the tendency to treat ethnic groups, nations and races as entities as to which interests and agency can be attributed.

165-166 There are certain issues with this: we can't rely on common sense to explain phenomena - we should not simply replicate it in our scholarly analyses or policy assessments.

We need to break with vernacular categories and common-sense understandings - for instance that ethnic conflict is not understood as conflict between ethnic groups: that we rather should deem it *ethnically framed* conflict.

Participant accounts must be remembered to have a performative character, as what [[Pierre Bourdieu]] has called them, groups that they seek to evoke and summon into being - designed to summon them. By reifying these groups, they 'contribute to producing what they apparently describe or designate.'

## Beyond groupism

How are we to understand ethnic conflict?
Here are eight basic points.

### Rethinking ethnicity

167 Ethnicity, race and nation should be conceptualised ... in relational, processual, dynamic, eventful and disaggregated terms - in terms of *practical categories, cultural idioms ... political projects*. Even racialization, nationalization as political, social, cultural and psychological processes.

### The reality of ethnicity

168 This is not to dispute their reality.

Racial idioms, ideologies, narratives and more are real and consequential.
But the reality of race does not depend on the existence of 'races' - the reality of ethnicity and nationhood and identification does not depend on the existence of ethnic groups or nations as substantial groups or entities.

### Groupness as event

Treating groupness as variable an d contingent allows us to take account of ... phases of extraordinary cohesion and moments of intensely felt collective solidarity without treating it as infinitely present - an *event*, something that happens.

It allows us to realize that groupness may not happen, may fail to crystalize ... helping us eliminate the bias that previous trains of thoughts had - that this can create an overly ethnic view of the world, viewing it as 'seething cauldrons' of ethnic tension.

### Groups and Categories

Much talk is obscured by the failure to distinguish between groups and category - groups are a collectively with capacity for concerted action. Categories are *not* groups.

With this in mind, we can problematize the relation between them - ask about the degree of groupness associated with this category.

We can ask how people do things with categories - limit access to resources, identify themselves and so on.

We analyse the organizational careers of categories - the process in which they become entrenched in administrative routines and embedded in culturally powerful myths, focusing on how categories are imposed.

### Group-making as project

171 We can attend then to the dynamic of group-making as a social, cultural and political project, aimed at transforming categories into groups or increasing levels of groupness.

The politics of seeking the worst outcome to improve their prospect in the long run - look at the Kosovo Liberation Army and their attacks on Serb policemen, creating reprisal on citizens and citizens to increase in groups, a never-ending cycle.

### Groups and organizations

172 Much of rhetoric treat ethnic groups as the protagonists of ethnic conflict, but the chief protagonists of most ethnic conflicts are not ethnic groups but kinds of organizations - states, organizational components and so on: some of these organizations representing themselves for ethnic groups.

These organizations cannot be equated with ethnic groups. They are organizations and possess certain resources that they are capable of organized action and acting as protagonists in ethnic conflicts.

Conflict and violence vary in the degree organizations are involved.

173 Even where organizations are the core protagonists, they depend on a penumbra of action on the part of sympathetic non-members - the representativeness of organizations ... express the interests and enjoy the active or passive support of its constituents. The representativeness of organizations ... is enormously variable.

Organizations too are not the objects or targets of conflicts and violence - entire population categories can be the objects of organized actions. Even apart from situations of violence, ethnic conflict may be carried out not by large organizations as such but spontaneously by individuals through such everyday actions like shunning, insults, demands for deference or conformity.

### Framing and coding

If the protagonists of ethnic conflicts aren't considered as ethnic groups, what creates ethnic violence?

The answer cannot be found in the intrinsic properties of behaviour: the ethnic quality of ethnic violence is attributed to instances of violent behaviour by perpetrators, victims, politicians, officials, journalists, researchers, relief workers or others.

Such acts ... constitute it as ethnic.

Framing is a key mechanism through which groupness is constructed.

174 Therein, we should see conflict and violence not only in ethnic, but in groupist terms.

Interpretive framing is often contested. Violence ... is regularly accompanied by social struggles to label, interpret and explain it. Such metaconflicts do not simply shadow conflicts but are integral - they cause an event to be seen as a 'pogrom', a 'riot' or a 'rebellion.'

Coding and framing practices are heavily influences by these interpretive frames. The accessibility of these practices, suggesting themselves to actors and analysts, generates a coding bias in the ethnic direction - causing us to overestimate the incidence of ethnic conflict and violence by seeing ethnicity everywhere at work. 

### Ethnicity as cognition.

These observations about the significance of coding and framing suggests that ... ethnicity, race and nationhood exist only in and through our perceptions, interpretations, representations, categorizations and identification - not things in the world but perspectives on the world.

These include many things: seeing, construing, inferring, remembering and everything.

## Implications

What's the point?

176 This has implications for journalists. Here are five.

1. Sensitivity to framing dynamics ... is in favour of ethnicity and ... mask the pursuit of clan, clique or class interest can alert us to the risk of over-ethicized or overly groupist interpretations of situations of conflict and violence. The spin put on conflicts by participants may conceal as much as it reveals, obscuring the interests at stake and dynamics involved.  What is represented as ethnic conflict ... may have more to do with thuggery, war lordship, opportunistic looting and so on.
2. Recognition of the centrality of organizations ... claims to speak and act in the name of ethnic groups ... can remind us not to mistake groupist rhetoric for real groupness.
3. Awareness of the interest that ethnic and nationalist leaders may have in living off politics as well as for politics, borrowing [[Max Weber]] (1946:84) and awareness of the divergence between the interests of leaders and constituents can keep us from accepting at face value leader's claims.
4. Sensitivity to the variable and contingent, waxing and waning nature of groupness, the fact that high levels of groupness may be the result of conflict ... (177) can focus our analytical attention and interventions on the process through which groupness tends to develop and crystalise.
5. A disaggregating, non-groupist approach can bring into analytical and policy focus the critical importance of intra-ethnic mechanism in generating putatively interethnic conflict - in-group policing, monitoring, instigation and so on.

## Ethnicity at work in a Transylvanian town

178 Let's consider how ethnicity works in an East Central European context characterized by continuous and intense elite-level ethnonational conflict since the fall of Communism.

Setting: city of Cluj, they identify themselves as Hungarian

Conflict: been home to ethnocentric conflicts.

Problem: don't conflate the two categories, Hungarian and Romanian, with groups, the Hungarians, the Romanians - and not obscure the generally low degree of groupness and accept the claims of nationalist organizations to speak for the groups they claim to represent and neglect the every-day contexts in which ethnic and national categories take on meaning.

179 Protagonists (of the conflict): the three-term mayor, the Romanian nationalist Gheorghe Funar - and the statewide nationalist parties against the Cluj-based Democratic Associations of Hungarians of Romania.

They called each other terrorist organisations.

The DAHR outrages the Romanian nationalists: it characterizes Hungarians as an indigenous community, characterizes the Hungarians as an organic part of the nation, claiming the right to cultivate relations for the mother country.

They demanded collective rights, their own institutional system and so on.

They claimed to speak for the Hungarian minority in Romania ... but many of the Cluj residents who self-identify as Hungarian are sharply critical of the DAHR and there is no evidence that the demands of the DAHR are the demands of 'the Hungarians'.

A study: many Hungarian university students preferred an autonomous system of Hungarian-language education.

Likewise, there is no evidence that Mayor Funar's views are widely shared by the town's Romanian residents: praised for being a 'good housekeeper' and having good municipal services. 

They all talk about ethnic conflict as something that 'comes from above', politicians pursuing their own interests.

181 Groupness has remained low. The Hungarians and Romanians did not crystallize as distinct groups.


#### A similar story in Targu Mures
... two days of street fighting that left six dead and two hundred injured.
... categories had become palpable, sharply bounded groups, united by intensely felt collective solidarity and animated by an 'us' versus 'them.

But, no crystallization occurred in Cluj - there were moments of heightened groupness but..
182 Only for a short moment and to a modest degree.

Even at these moments, there was no overriding sense of bounded and solidary groupness.
When one shifts one's focus from presupposed groups to variable groupness, treating high levels of groupness as a contingent event, then what is striking about Cluj is that groupness remained low and groups failed to happen.

183 This is not to argue that ethnicity is not real or that it is an elite phenomenom.

Let's consider the categories Romanian and Hungarians.
Starting with groups, let us ask what groups want, think of themselves and aspire towards.
One is led to the substantialist language to attribute identity.

Starting with categories, it invites us to focus on processes and relations rather than substances.
It invites us to specify how people do things with and how categories are used to channel relations, how they get institutionalized.
It invites us to ask why and how ethnic categories are used.

Two ways of pursuing a category:
First, a good deal of common-sense cultural knowledge is organized around ethnonational categories - knowledge of one's own nationality and ability to assign unknown others to ethnonational categories on the basis of cues and more. Such common-sense category-based knowledge shapes everyday interaction, governing how they speak to one another or so on.

184 For Romanians, categorizing two persons speaking Hungarian in a mixed-language setting provides a ready-made explanation for their conduct - being common sense that Hungarians will form a bisericuta.

They shape institutional as well as informal cognition and recognition - perception, interpretation, used to allocate rights, regulate actions, distribute benefits and burdens and so on.

There is one important set of institutions built around ethnic categories - the school system.

185 There is a separate Hungarian language school system, part of the state school. Not all people identifying themselves as Hungarian attend these schools.

Categories need ecological niches in which to survive and flourish - a strategically positioned niche. The parallel school system provides such a niche, a legitimate institutional home and a protected public space - the social structural foundations. It shapes opportunity structures and contact probabilities and friendship patterns.

## Conclusions

186 We need to frame our analysis not in terms of ethnic groups, but practical categories - cultural idioms, cognitive schemes, common-sense knowledge and so on.

By framing our inquiry in this way, we may not end up studying ethnicity - ethnicity is just a convenient rubric.

In this regard, by raising questions about the unit of analysis, we question its domain - ethnicity itself.
