## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
The Grenfell Tower fire that took place in a council owned high-rise housing block in the early hours of 14 June 2017 in the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea represented the worst fire in Britain for many decades. This article draws, in part, on the example of Grenfell Tower to interrogate some of the most pressing issues of our time around poverty, inequality and austerity. After a period of quiet, poverty now features more regularly in popular and political conversations. This is, in part, due to the proliferation of foodbanks that in many ways have become the public face of poverty in contemporary Britain. Additionally the increased popularity of so-called ‘poverty porn’ exemplified by programmes such as Benefit Street have provoked public and political debate about the realities of poverty and its causes and consequences. Punitive policies towards out of work benefits claimants, austerity measures and the proliferation of low paid and insecure work mean poverty has been extended to more and more people, yet at the same time it is a condition that is frequently stigmatised, misrepresented and misunderstood. Whilst evidence shows increased stereotyping and stigmatisation of those experiencing poverty and other related disadvantages, there is also evidence that the British general public on the whole tend to care about fairness, equality of opportunity and that they dislike extremes of income and wealth, although importantly they also generally underestimate the realities of both. It was these extremes of inequality that Grenfell thrust so violently into the public imagination with many newspapers visually capturing the gulf between rich and ‘poor’ in their pictures of the burnt out shell of Grenfell set against a typical block of luxury apartments of the sort that are proliferating in London and other cities in Britain and that, particularly in London, often cost in excess of a million pounds or more. This article looks at examples of how critical work is being done by those in power to manipulate and frame the terms of the discussion around poverty, inequality and economic insecurity and its causes and its consequences.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?
The fire at Grenfell Tower was one of the worst fire disasters in the Uk for decades, bringing into critical relief some of the issues of extreme economic inequality. This article is concerned with poverty and inequality in Britain and the UK.

Successive British governments have pursued a particularly aggressive neoliberal agenda of deliberately deepening inequalities since the Thatcher government of the 1980s.

Those on the lowest incomes and those who experience poverty face structural limits to their live opportunities.

I argue that these misleading, damaging and divisive depictions of those experiencing poverty and related disadvantages might best be described as poverty propaganda.

### How is the article organised?
This article has three main parts: the first outlines the current economic and political context in the UK and looks at the role of stigma and shame and the importance of poverty propaganda in perpetuating particular views around poverty and disadvantage.

Next, we will look at the Grenfell fire disaster and this disaster epitomises so much that is unfair and divisive with neoliberal capitalism but the disaster reveals the shameless dishonesty of poverty propaganda.

The final article attempts to understand the issues raised in the article and offers some reflections on why poverty propaganda is so successful.

### What are the key takeaways?
These misleading, damaging and divisive depictions of those experiencing poverty and related disadvantages might best be described as poverty propaganda. In contemporary Britain poverty propaganda works to stigmatise and label those experiencing poverty and related disadvantages and thus effectively hides the real causes and consequence of poverty.

Punitive and divisive policies towards poverty become more palatable. The narratives contained within the poverty propaganda are so powerful that even people experiencing poverty subscribe to those truth. Yet, attitudes are multi-layered: people underestimate the extent of extreme wealth as well as the hardship for those experiencing poverty. Even those in the top one percent of the wealthiest people in the UK express views that downplay their wealth and privilege.

### Inequality, policies that hurt and the power of poverty propaganda
[[Thomas Piketty]] published his influential book *Capital in the Twenty First Century* in 2014.

Here, he argued that those with economic resources were benefitting most from the way most capitalist societies were organised, resulting in gross economic inequalities.

In contrast, poverty has been increasing at a dramatic rate as a direct result of punitive policies directed towards those experiencing poverty and disadvantage in the UK. Poverty in the UK has two main causes: insecure paid employment and inadequate financial support for out of work benefit claimants.

Yet poverty and economic disadvantages are rarely called out as a result of policy and political decisions but rather the result of individual behaviours 0 produced via political speak, policy documents and reinforced by the media.

Welfare in the form of out of work benefits is placed centre stage in the production of poverty propaganda despite the fact that out of work benefits make up only a small proportion of the 'welfare' bill and out of work benefits provide a very limited income. Politicians deploy fantastical stories of those benefiting from the welfare state.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The Grenfell Tower disaster and the dishonesty of poverty propaganda.

In many respects the fire exposed many of worst aspects of contemporary neoliberal capitalism, not just in terms of inequality and social housing but also in the ways that profits can be put before people's lives and well-being and how cuts to public services such as the police and fire services can have deadly consequences.

(Below, three paragraphs, 788-789)
Places like Grenfell Tower, predominantly social housing managed by the local authority have a special place in the poverty propaganda described above. Political figures have made a stink about the 'sink estate' - 'left behind estates'.

Research suggests that despite the inevitable problems that blight areas where there are large concentrations of poverty, people still value their homes and communities - many residents were keen to move into the flats, and the view of the London Skyline was fantastic according to two young people who moved to London.

Yet there were major structural shortcomings in the quality of the accommodation and safety of the tower block. The limited and unsafe housing conditions had been laid bare. As housing becomes more expensive, it has become the site of a class struggle - parental wealth is crucial for people to access homes, housing options for those on out of work benefits have been decimated, many serve as second or fourth homes are rented out to those who are reliant on the rental market. Many people with disabilities live in social housings that make them liable to death when lifts are out of order.

Grenfell reveals the dishonesty of popular depictions both of poverty and of those who reside in social housing. The lists of the dead and the missing that emerged in the days and weeks after the fire make for difficult and painful reading.

Poverty propaganda rests upon the notion that people experiencing poverty are workshy. The divisive and damaging caricature of the 'welfare' cheat, faring well on benefits, obscures the facts of everyday struggle where low paid and insecure work is now a significant cause of poverty in the UK. Everyday ordinary workers who keep London functioning lived in Grenfell and many like them lived in social housing up and down the county. (p, 790)

It was filed up of ordinary people.

### Poverty propaganda and stigma as class power

This section draws together some of the issues outlined above and reflects on both the impact and purpose of poverty propaganda and the ubiquitous stigma attached to poverty.

```ad-quote

Poverty propaganda is given voice, and hence power, though the mainstream media, in ways that hard evidence about poverty or the grind of day-to-day life in low paid, insecure work that fails to take people away from poverty, either far enough or for long enough, to make a real difference to their lives, very rarely is. It is most often the affluent and the powerful (and in many cases those who have the power to resolve poverty or extend the condition to more and more citizens) who hold the cards about how poverty is presented in public arenas. The voices of those with first hand experience are very rarely heard or where they are, they are moulded, shaped and represented in particular ways.

```

Evidence suggests that people experiencing poverty frequently feel ignored and not listened to and powerless to challenge decisions made about their lives - being denied the economic benefits of Capitalism or not being taken seriously was a factor for people's decision to leave. People are not oblivious to the unfairness of their life chances (p, 791).

This is sharply shown with the disconnect between poverty and wealth as it is revealed that residents had concerned about the safety of the tower block. They had concerns and these concerns were never acted upon. The real causes of poverty and its caricature, as well as the importance of low paid and insecure work rarely features in the public and political debates. In some sense, punishing and cruel policies can be wrought on those experiencing poverty. (p. 792)

The power of stigma, as it has been developed and used to negatively label those experiencing poverty and disadvantages, plays a significant role in fostering a climate of distrust and a propensity to distance oneself from people at the lower end of the income scale, promoting a view of disadvantaged people as 'the other.'

[[Imogen Tyler]] has talked about the power of 'resource stigma power' - a mechanism for the exercise and imposition of power..

```ad-quote
Despite widespread understanding of the unfairness of life conditions amongst those who are economically marginalised, poverty propaganda is so powerful and effective at manufacturing confusion about the root causes of deepening structural inequalities, that it aids the deepening of gross structural inequalities to be both perpetuated over time and tolerated as being inevitable and just and deserved. As such, poverty propaganda is a mighty political tool that orchestrates widespread consent for a political system that affords punishing life opportunities for significant numbers of its citizens whilst continuing to bolster the weight and strength of the cushions that protect the few.
