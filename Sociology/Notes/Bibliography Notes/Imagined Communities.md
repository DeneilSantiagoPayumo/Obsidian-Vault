Benedict Anderson - [[Nations and nationalism]]
Chapter 1 and 8

---

## Introduction

Anderson argues that the inflow of nationalism has only massively increased over time.

2

Every successful revolution has defined itself in national terms - history, grounded from the past.

Eric Hobsawm argues that "Marxist movements and states tended to become national not only in form but in substance ... there is nothing to suggest that this trend will continue."

3

Many new UN members find themselves challenged by sub-nationalism and want to leave it.
The reality is plain - the end of nationalism is not remotely in sight.

4

Anderson will argue and put forth:
1. Tentative interpretations of nationalism
2. That the creation of these artefacts was due to discrete historical forces, becoming modular, transported into a variety of social terrain
3. That these artefacts have aroused such deep attachments.

5

Concepts and paradoxes:
1. The objective modernity of nations to the historian's eye vs their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists
2. The formality universality of nationalist as a social-cultural concept (everyone has a nationality)
3. The political power of nationalism vs their philosophical poverty

This difficulty is that one thinks of Nationalism-with-a-big-N and classifies it as an ideology. It belonged rather with kinship and religion, not fascism.

6

In an anthropological spirit, Anderson proposes the definition of an imagined political community - inherently limited and sovereign.

Called imagined - smallest nations will never meet or know most of their members.  Even areas like Javaneese villages know they are connected to people they have never seen, but they are stretched a lot.

7

Called limited because even the largest of them has finite boundaries beyond which lies other nations - no nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind.

Called sovereign because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. Coming to maturity when religion was confronted with the pluralism as such, and the allomorphic between each faith's claim and stretch.

Called a community because the nation is conceived as a deep horizontal comradeship - that makes people willing to die for it.

## Cultural Roots

Anderson discusses the tomb of the fallen soldier - can you imagine anything like Marxists doing that?

11

Who expresses their child's conception and birth without dimly apprehending a combined connectedness, fortuity, and fatality in a language of continuity.

In West Euro, the 18th century marks the dusk of religious modes of thought - bringing modern darkness, disintegration of paradise, absurdity of salvation - what was required was a secular transformation of fatality.

What was needed was a secular transformation of fatality into continuity, contingency into meaning

12

Anderson proposes that nationalism must be understood by aligning it ... with the large cultural systems that preceded it - the religious community and dynastic realm.

## THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY

13

All the great communities conceived themselves as cosmically central through the medium of a sacred language linked to a superterrestrial order of power.

Yet such communities had a character distinct from imagined communities of modern nations - confidence in the sacredness of their language and ideas about membership.

14

The Indian is ultimately redeemable - by impregnating nation with white 'civilized' semen, and the acquisition of private property.

If the sacred silent languages were the media through which the great global communities of the past were imagined, the ideograms of Chinese, Latin, or Arabic were emanations of reality.

There is no idea of a world so separated from language that all languages are equidistant ... in effect, ontological reality is apprehensible only through a single privileged system of representation.

The whole nature of man's being is sacredly malleable. 

15

Truth-languages, imbued with an impulse largely foreign, the impulse towards conversion.

It was the possibility of conversion through the sacred language that allowed people to become pope, and a Manchu son of Heaven (despite both being English)

This led communities like Christendom imaginable - the actual scope could not be explained by sacred script.

The fundamental conception about social groups were hierarchical and centripetal.

The astonishing power of the papacy is comprehensible in terms of a trans-European Latin-writing clerisy and a conception of the world of the bilingual intelligentsia.

16

For all of this power, their unselfconscious coherence waned away.

First, was the effect of exploration of the non-European world.

17

He looks at a passage of Marco Polo that finds the start the territorialization of faiths - looks at 'our', the description of the Christian faith as 'truest.'

18

Second was the demotion of the sacred language - print-capitalism helped do this.

Febvre and Martin estimated that 77% of the books printed before 1500 were in Latin ... but Latin's hegemony was doomed after future books were printed in French. Latin ceased to be the language of a pan-European high intelligentsia.

After 1640 - less books in Latin, more in vernacular languages.

19

## THE DYNASTIC REALM

In fundamental ways, serious monarchy lies transverse to all modern conceptions of political life.

Paradoxically enough, the ease with which pre-modern empires and kingdoms were able to sustain their rule over immensely heterogenous and often not even contiguous populations for long periods of time.

One must remember that these antique states expaned through sexual politics.

20

Through general principle of verticality, dynastic marriages brought together diverse populations under new apices.

In realms where polygamy was sanctioned, complex systems of tiered concubinage were essential to the integration of the realm - royal lineages derived their prestige from miscegenation.

21

During the seventeenth century, the automatic legitimacy of sacral monarchy began its slow decline in West Euro. Charles Stuart was beheaded in 1649, and in 1789, monarchy became a model - Tenno and Son of Heaven became emperors.

In 1887, he (Chulalongkorn, Siam Rama V) instituted that the requisite principle of succession-by-legal-primogeniture - bringing to the throne an erratic homosexual who would certainly have been passed over in an earlier age.

22

As a result dynastic states made up the majority of the membership of the world's political system but ... many dynasts had for some time have been reaching for a 'national' cachet as the old principle of Legitimacy withered silently withered away.

## APPREHENSIONS OF TIME

It would be short-signed to think of the imagined communities of nations as simply growing out of and replacing religious communities and dynastic realms - a fundamental change was taking place ... to 'think' the nation.

We must take a look at the visual representation of the sacred communities.

A characteristic feature of such representation is something misleading analogous to 'modern dress'.

(Author looks at stain glass windows and paintings)

What seems incongruous today appeared natural to the eyes of medieval worshippers.

The figuring of imagined reality was overwhelmingly visual and aural.

24

Our own concept of simultaneity has been a large time in the making ... in ways that have been yet to be well studied, with the development of the secular sciences - a conception of important that we find it difficult to probe the genesis of nationalism.

Why this transformation should be so important for the birth of the imagined community of the nation can best be seen if we considered the basic structure of two forms of imagining which first flowered

25

Europe in the eighteenth century; the novel and the newspaper.

Consider the novel -

![[Pasted image 20231016142636.png]]

What links A to D?
Two conceptions:
First, they are embedded in 'societies' and these societies are sociological entities of such firm and stable reality that their members can be described as passing each other on the street, without ever becoming acquainted, and still be connection.

26

Second, A and D are embedded in the minds of the omniscient readers - watching all three play their roles at the same time ... actors who may be largely unaware of one another.

The idea of a sociological organism moving calendrically through homogenous, empty time is a precise analogue of the idea of a nation, conceived as a solid community moving steadily down (or up) history.

Let's examine four fictions from different cultures and different epochs:

First, the Anderson examines a Filipino novel.

27

He notes how a dinner party is being discussed by hundreds of unnamed people - in different parts of Manilla, conjuring up an imagined community
The casual progression of this house from this house to the exterior gives a confirmation of the solidity of a single community, embracing characters moving through calendrical time.

He notes the tone.

28

The Filipino author writes to them with ironical intimacy as though their relationship is not problematic.

Now, let's compare this Noli with The Story of Forante and Laura in the Kingdom of Albania - composed as early as 1838.

Its setting, a medieval Albania, is removed in time from the Binondo of the 1880s - whereas Ritzal (the previous writer) delbierately sprinkles his psanish prose with Tagalog for satirical effect, Balagtas unselfconsciously mixes Spanish phrases into his Tagalog quatrains simply to heighten the grandeur and sonority of his diction. Most strikingly is the handling of time, the in media res with almost half of the 399 quatrains are accounts fo Florante's childhood, student years in Athens, and subsequent military exploits given by the hero in convo with Aladin.

We learn of Florante and Aladin's pasts through their conversing voices, not by the structure of the epic.

29

In 1816, seventy years before the writing of Noli, Jose Joaquin Fernandez de Lizardi wrote a novel called El Periquillo Samiento (The Itching Parrot), a Latin American work that is 'a ferocious indictment of Spanish administration' - the essential form indicated by this:

Anderson writes about the description of the novel's content.

30

We see the national imagination at work here in the movement of a solitary hero through a sociological landscape of a fixity that fuses the world inside the novel with the world outside - the tours of hospitals,, prisons, remote villages, monasteries, Indians - clearly bounded of colonial Mexico.

The succession of plurals - a social space full of comparative prisons, representativeness of *this* colony.

The author then looks at the opening of the Semarang Hitam, a story written by a young Indonesian communist-nationalist

32

In this world, we enter a world full of plurals: shops, offices, carriages, gas lamps. We are plunged immediately into calendrical time and a familiar landscape: one of us may too have walked through them.

A solitary hero is juxtaposed to a socioscape described in careful general detail. There is a hero that is never named - there is no doubt about the reference. Our young hero is a young man who belongs to a collective body of readers of Indonesians, an imagined community - that he does not need to specify this community by name, as it is already there.

The imagined community is confirmed by the doubleness of our reading: he does find the corpse, but imagines it from the print in a newspaper - he thinks of the representative body, not the personal life.

33

What is the literary convention of the newspaper? We might find famine in Mali, a murder, a coup in Iraq ,,, but why are these events so juxtaposed? All of these happen independently. The arbitrariness of their inclusion shows that the linkage between them is imagined.

This derives from two related sources: the first is calendrical coincidence, the date at the top of the newspaper provides the connection. If Mali disappeared, then we don't assume Mali has died, but only that the character Mali moves along quietly.

The second source lies in the relationship between the newspaper, as a form of book, and the market. It has been estimated that more than 20 million volumes were produced in Europe between teh publication of the Gutenberg Bible and the close of the fifteenth century.

34

In this perspective, the newspaper is merely an 'extreme form' of the book - a book sold on a colossal scale, but of ephemeral popularity.

35

The obsolescence of the newspaper creates an extraordinary mass ceremony.

It's a ceremony that substitute morning prayers, performed in silent privacy, replicated simultaneously by thousands, repeated at daily intervals throughout the day,

36

In summary:
The very possibility of imagining the nation only rose historically when, and where, three fundamental cultural conceptions, lost their grip on men's mind.

First, scrip language offered privileged access to ontological truth, that brought sodalities of Christendom.
Second, was the belief that society was organised around high centres - monarchs who were persons apart from other human beings and ruled by dispensation
Third was a conception of temporality in which cosmology and history were indistinguishable, the origins of the world and of men identical.

Combined, these ideas rooted human lives firmly in the nature of things, giving certain meanings to the everyday fatalities of existence.

The slow decline of these certainties under the impact of economic change, discoveries, the development of rapid communication, drove a harsh wedge between cosmology and history.

### Patriotism and Racism

In the preceding chapters, we have delineate the processes by which the nation came to be imagined, modelled, adapted and transformed. This has been concerned with social change and consciousness, but it is doubtful whether social change or transformed consciousness do much to explain the attachment that people feel for the inventions of their imaginations.

It is useful to remind us that nations inspire love, cultural products as well as fear and hatred of the Other and racism.

142

On the other hand, it is hard to find analogous nationalist products expressing fear and loathing - it is astonishing how insignificant the elements of hatred is in these expressions of national feeling even in the case of colonized people.

143

The author describes the patriotism in a poem written by Ritzal as he awaited execution at the hands of Spanish imperialism.

The nationality of the tyrants goes unmentioned but this patriotism is expressed in their language.

Something of the nature of this political love can be deciphered from how languages describe its object: either in vocabulary of kinship or that of home, denoting something to which one is naturally tied.

In every natural there is something unchosen - nationness is assimilated to skin-colour, gender, parentage and birth-era: because they are not chosen they have a halo of disinterestedness.

144

Family has been conceived of disinterested love and solidarity, and if historians, diplomats, politician's, and social scientists are at ease with national interest the whole point of the nation is that it is interestless, as it can ask for sacrifices..

The great wars of this century are extraordinary not in the scale of which they permitted people to kill, but those persuaded to lay down their lives.

Dying for one's country assumes a moral grandeur to which it is felt to be fundamentally pure. Ironically, it may be that Marxist interpretations of history are felt as representations of ineluctable ncessity.

We return to language:
First, one notes the primordial nature of languages, no one can give the date for the birth of any language. Languages thus appear rooted beyond almost anything else in contemporary societies. Nothing connects us affectively to the dead more than language: Earth to Earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust: a ghostly intimation of simulaneity across homogenous empty times.

There is a special kind of contemporaneous community which language alone suggests: national anthems, for instance.

Nationalness has an aura of fatality, showing that the nation was conceived in language and one could be invited into it. Even the most insular nation accept the principle of naturalization no matter how difficult it is to subsume it.

146

Seen as both a historical fatality and as a community imagined through language, the nation presents itself as simultaneously open and closed. This paradox is well illustrated in the shifting rhythms of these famous lines on the death of John Moore during the battle of C.

The author describes the poem.

The lines celebrate a heroic memory with a beauty inseparable from the English language - yet both Moore and his eulogist were Irishmen, and there is no reason why a descendant of Moore's French or Spanish foes can not fully hear the poem's resonance.

147

Egypt, Greece and Judaea are united with the Holy Roman Empire but the unification across thousands of years and miles is accomplished within the particularity of Browne's seventeenth-century prose.

148

If every language is acquirable, its acquisition requires a real portion of a person's life: each new conquest is measured against shortening days. What limits one's access to other language is but one's own mortality. Hence, a certain privacy to all languages.

Such epithets (a rage at Vietnamese 'inscrutability' and 'obscure despair: gooks, ratons,') incredibly racist ... but developments in this form are mistaken in arguing that racism and anti-semitism derive from nationalism - and thus fascism tell us more about nationalism than any other episode.

A word 'slant' from 'slant-eyed' does not simply express an ordinary political enmity. It erases nation-ness by reducing the adversary to his biological physiognomy, substituting Vietnamese into a nameless sludge of Korean, Chinese, Filipino

149

The fact of the matter is that nationalism thinks in terms of historical destinies, while racism dreams of eternal contaminations, transmitted from the origins of time through an endless sequence of loathsome copulations: outside history. Jews forever jews no matter what passport they carry.

Dreams of racism have their origins in ideologies of class rather than those of nation: claims of divinity among rulers, blue or white blood, breeding among aristocracies. No rurpsie that the putative sire of modern racism:

150

Antisemitism manifest themselves not across national boundaries but within them, not justifying foreign wars as domestic repression and domination.

When racism developed outside Europe, it was associated with European domination for two reasons:
1. The rise of official nationalism and colonial Russification,  

Nationalism was typically a response on the part of threatened dynastic and aristocratic groups to vernacular nationalism.

Colonial racism was a weapon: generalizing a principle of innate, inherited superiority on which its own domestic position was based to the vastness of the overseas possession.

One is tempted to argue that the existence of late colonial empires shore up domestic aristocratic bastions.

2. The colonial empire permitted sizeable numbers of bourgeois and petty bourgeois to play aristocrat off centre court.

In each colony one found this grimly amusing tableau vivant: poetry against mansions, houseboys and so on.

151

This tropical gothic was made possible by the overwhelming power that high capitalism had given the metropole, often even in formal institutional terms.

In Europe, one had the "First Army" - recruited by conscriptions on a mass, citizen, metropolitan base; conceived as the defender of the heimat; dressed in utilitarian khaki: armed with latest affordable weapons.

Outside Europe one had the "Second Army" recruited from local religious or ethnic minorities on a mercenary basis, conceived as an internal police force.

152

Another instructive indication of the aristocratic or pseudo-aristocratic derivation of colonial racism was the typical 'solidarity among whites' which linked colonial rulers from different national metropoles.

This solidarity reminds one of Europe's nineteenth-century aristocracies, mediated through each other hunting-lodge, spas, ballrooms, brotherhood of officers and gentlemen.

Pronouncement of certain colonial ideologues aside, it is remarkable how little that dubious entity of reverse racism manifested itself in the anticolonial movements. There is a sense in which the Javanese word Londo meant not only Dutch but Whites. The derivations itself shows that for Javanese peasants who scarcely ever encountered any whites but Dutch, the two meanings overlapped

153

One can find without difficulty analogies on the other side of the globe - Spanish-speaking Mexicans trace their ancestries not to Castilian conquistadors but to half-obliterated Aztecs, Mayans, Toltecs and Zapotecs.

It may appear paradoxical that the objects of these attachments are imagined - but there is always an element of fond imagining.

What the eye is to the lover - of that particular ordinary eye he or she is born with - language - whatever language history has made his or her mother-tongue - is to the patriot.
