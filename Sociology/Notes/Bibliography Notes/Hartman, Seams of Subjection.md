Main points:
- "Hartman explains that scenes of enjoyment were actually social rituals that reinforced the dialectic of power. For example, in slave autobiographies like Solomon Northrup's Twelve Years a Slave, even the most ostensibly benign, Quotidian forms of coercive cruelty-for instance slaves' being compelled to dance, fiddle, and laugh before their masters-were symbolic re-enactments of the original act of transforming free persons into slaves." (684). Symbolic tool of the master class to force African Americans to have fun. Simulated contentment.
- Social struggle in everyday action, symbolic: work slowdown, feigned illness, night-time visit to lovers. Dancing and other pleasurable activities.
- Discourse of seduction - ensnaring sexual agency for weak, dependent slave women - seduction obscures the brutal fact of sexual exploitation and asymmetries of power in the master-slave relation. "The appeal to mutual bonds of affection between masters and slaves was linked to the presumption that any sexual relations between them were always reciprocal and consensual. Rape was not just considered unlikely - it was legally unimaginable. Seduction and the ambiguous guise of affection were used to obscure the actual violence of slavery and ensured that the common practice of raping slave women was an offense that was neither recognized nor punishable by law." (685)
- Emancipation wasn't enough to be rid of racial subjugation: freedmen were adrift in racist lands, extension of civil rights to freedmen, replacement of the whip with lynching, black codes, the contract system...

Hartman, in an interview:
"I had read Marx and [Orlando] Patterson, so I understood the limits of political emancipation as well as the distinction between manumission and emancipation and the disestablishment or abolition of slavery. The other major concern was theorizing violence: not just spectacular instances of violence, but the ordinary or quotidian violence that structures everyday life. The Marxist narrative of modes of production or the Foucauldian account of modes of power seemed inadequate when accounting for slavery. Taking seriously the issue of chattel slavery or racial slavery in the settler colony threw a wrench into those explanatory frames." 

Term "exploited worker" and "unpaid labourer" failed to describe slavery:
"They failed to describe the fundamental violence of slavery; the particular modes of accumulation, extraction, and reproduction in racial slavery; the dual existence of the enslaved as subject-object; the state of social death; the hierarchy of the human; and the fungibility of Black life."

How can we feel slavery in the present?
"The fungibility and disposability of Black life. The state-sanctioned murder of Black people. The radically restricted life chances of Black people. That is the world I knew and experienced, but thinking along these lines was untimely and certainly unwelcome. On the one hand, multiculturalism and the post-racial society were the hegemonic frame at the time, and on the other hand, the tremendous violence of the state and its carceral machinery targeted Black people as predators and criminals and made incarceration and premature death the expected horizon. [President Bill] Clinton’s liberal establishment was dismantling the welfare state and building the carceral complex."

"There was a common sense understanding that the violence of slavery solely concerned the object status or denied humanity of the enslaved. But enslaved people were also recognized as human in slave law and statutes. The enslaved existed as subject and object—as property and as human—and their humanity was another site of violence."
