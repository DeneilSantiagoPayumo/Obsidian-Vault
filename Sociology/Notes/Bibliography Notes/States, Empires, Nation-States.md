What is Political Sociology? pp 25-44 [[The State, What Is It and Who Rules It]]

## States, Empires, Nation-States

States can be described as a central set of institutions from which political relations - including authoritative rule making and control of political violence - extend to cover a territory.

Two different ways of constructing a state have been prominent: empires and nation-states. The difference can be captured by the relationship between the character of rule, direct or indirect, and its relationship to group membership or identity. Empires rest on extensive relation of indirect rule without a corresponding sense of shared cultural and political membership.

Nation-states are interesting - this coincidence of relations and political organization is the product of nationalism and the nation-state. Those contained within national borders share language, cuisine, and even reproductive practices: as the borders change, everything does.

In all their (Japan, US, Africa) different forms, political systems were based on imperialism as a system of indirect rule.

Conquest and settlement became what fuelled further conflicts and transformation - Haitian revolution, American revolution.

### Direct and Indirect Rule

Organized rule appears in settings that Michael Mann described as "social cages" - the containment of human beings behind clear, fixed, confined social and territorial boundaries. As states emerge through the exercise of central control over local systems of inequality, competition creates. There are two ways of exerting that control.

indirect rule - co-opt local and regional powerholders without utterly transforming their bases of power. A would-be ruler would have no choice but to bargain with authorities of competing centres ([[Charles Tilly]])

These systems rest on bargains between the central ruler and those now-local notables.

Systems of indirect rule involve a trade-off between lower administrative requirements on the centre and a lack of control over and visibility into conditions in each locality - by depending on a local notable to collect taxes, they are relieved of building an apparatus for tax collection but must depend on local notables to provide honest accounts and to deliver the expected tax revenue at the appointed time.

There were some alternatives: systems of exchange and loyalty that characterised feudalism. Kings gave lords title to land and the associated population, repeating this relationship with lords to gentry and so on. These rearrangements took place in multiple ways: elaborating shared identities, asserting force violently.

These rearrangements created regimes from monarchies, theocracies, republics and so on.

### Culture and the Consolidation of Power: Tolerance and Nationalism

Karen Barkey studies the Ottoman Empire. She characterised those who constructed the empire as formidable builders of networks within and across the ethnic, religious, and political identities found in the terrain between a collapsing Roman Empire and the Safavid Empire) was home to Jews, Christians, Muslims and so on. They organized for conflict, wanted control and consulted with sages, respected mystics. This practice of networking shaped an empire considered stronger because of its diversity. As long as communities subordinated to Islam, they could do anything they wanted!

This is one method. This solution might be strained by the need of rulers to insure the loyalty of those who served them and the solidarity over whom they ruled. The Dutch relied on family ties and this was threatened as empires grew in scale and scope.

[[Benedict Anderson]] traced the origins of nationalism in such a rift in the social networks that bound empires together. He takes the perspective of a talented creole: these assumptions of who could or could not be promoted to the highest offices created benefits of social closure.

The Creoles had the same relationships to arms, disease, Christianity and European culture as the metropolitans - they had the means for asserting themselves. In such a definition, peripheral elites and masses could unite to unravel the ties of indirect rule.

Cultures of nationalism developed first on the peripheries of empires, but the project of building a people then travelled back to the political centres or metropoles where rulers faced new threats of legitimacy as [[Habernas]] describes the "bourgeois public sphere" - this new domain of public discourse, centred on shared concern for an economic system built on private property, created political mobilization.

### The Construction of the Modern Nation-State

The emergence of the nation-state as a dominant form of political order can be traced through a number of the first global empires. Benedict Anderson investigated the Spanish Empire but similar sequences were unfolding in the Dutch Empire and so on. Merchants and more united in a conflict to throw off Spanish rule - and they wanted to learn how to gain consent and obedience of those over whom they wanted to rule.

[[Michel Foucault]] argues that this can be understood in terms of the emergence of new modes of governing - those that focused on the management of things and property to the management of populations, biopolitics. As state administrative structures developed, they were sustained by new kinds of trained personnel that allowed the state to collect taxes based on property and trade. The modern census documents everything.

The need to manage the population was clear to the Dutch elites who gained control as a result of the rebellion against the Hapsburg Empire. These empowered Protestants invented new ways of harnessing religious belief to maintain political order - a house of discipline, that had forced labour, corporal punishment and so on. Even an ascetic religion like Calvinism could invent strategies for maintaining collective discipline within the church.

In Japan, rulers wanted the obedience of the disadvantaged and the loyalty and control of the samurai warriors who played a role in securing the domination of the emperor. The cementing of centralized rule entailed transformations in the cultural selves of those with the most potential to disrupt the new system of rule.

The incentives to find alternatives to domination increase as state leaders attempt to extend and intensify systems of direct rule - marked by new techniques for mapping, counting and penetrating into the economic and social lives of their subjects. it did so at the cost of widespread resistance, extensive bargaining, the creation of rights and perquisites for citizens.

### Shaped by War, Trade, and Liberation

The effort of building any kind of state always involves multiple projects including the management of domestic populations and of foreign relations, both economic and military, perhaps taking the form of factional politics within the central state, where tax collection can create more powerful armies.

With a secure and controlled boundaries, states can set other dynamics in motion - the expansion of trade organized through imperial relations or global markets. Just as the potency of social cages is grounded in a combination of interdependence, loyalty, and lack of opportunity for exit, the same kind of dynamics are replicated at large and global scales in the consolidation of imperial systems.

One of the forces holding together these concepts was the idea that taking a subordinate role in an imperial regime outweighed the costs - benefits might take the form of participation in systems of trade, access to more powerful medical technologies and so on. These calculations were always subject to revision and contestation.

Many of these changes were key elements of the emergence of the modern nation-state: the linking of administrative power to a cultural sense of membership or nationhood, the increased capacity for war-making and the linking of national belonging to principles of popular sovereignty.

The growing cultural power of nationalism drove other changes in the relationship between metropolitan powers and their settlements - it operated in a still harsher way to structure relationships between imperial powers and provinces in the face of significant differences in physical appearance and cultural practice,

Colonialism was based on an understanding of colonizer and colonized as different and unequal - a brutal collision of practices of domination and cultural standards that generated harsh new cultural models.

This emphasis on cultural and physical differences opened up new political possibilities - local elites and masses are on the same side of that divide. [[Franz Fanon]] traced the psychopolitical damage inflicted on the colonized - the violence of the colonized unifies the people, separatist and regionalist. Colonialism reinforces and differentiates these tribes. This sharpening of the boundaries of identity through colonial rule is intensified by the mobilization in the struggle for liberation which reinforces the notion of common cause, national destiny, and collective history into every consciousness.

Powerful cultural assumptions about citizenship flow along the ideological networks formed within imperial systems.

Commentators from other imperial traditions made note of the strangeness of this effort by the Americans to enforce this ideal. America developed a model that differed from other imperial traditions while falling short of democratic tutelage. Assumptions about the potential lead to differing standards of education and government in many countries, such as the Philippines!

Because the systems of political order and membership *within* the metropolitan nation-state often differed *between* the state and its colonies, military and ideological force has to be marshalled to maintain these networks.

### Politics and the Path of Social Change

The revival of a language of American Empire should remind us that the advantages and disadvantages of different forms of political order shift with time and the calculation of a changing cast of political actors.

By highlighting the notion of indirect rule, direct rule and membership, it's not hard to see how these processes are played out in contemporary politics - Scotland voted on a proposal to leave the UK but was failed. Contemporary politics activates cleavages that are not completely erased by earlier processes of moving from indirect to direct rule, reinforced by the construction of an overarching sense of national belonging.
