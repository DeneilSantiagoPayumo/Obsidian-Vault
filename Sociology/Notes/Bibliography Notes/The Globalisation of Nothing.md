### Nothing: A Brief (No Need to be Length) Introduction

#### What were the key points of this chapter?

Nothing here is employed as to mean "generally centrally conceived and controlled social forms that are comparatively devoid of distinctive substantive content." (xi)

Four types of nothing are dealt with here: non-places, non-things, non-people, and non-services.

There is a general something-nothing continuum and more specific subcontinua: places-non-places, things-non-things, people-non-people, services-non-services.

The basic argument is that globalization and nothing ... Go hand in hand. By definition, it is easier to globalize that which is centrally conceived and controlled ... In addition, it is far easeir to globalize largely empty forms than those that are loaded with content ... The main reason is that which has much content also offers  much that has the potential not to fit into, even to conflict with, aspects of other culture around the world; the more the content, the greater the chance that some phenomenon will not fit or be accepted." (xii)

We've got glocalization - now grobalization, in which growth imperatives push organisations to expand internationally.

"The main reason lies in the fact that the loss to be described here exists in a structural sense ... But it is not subjectively felt as a loss by the people who are so attracted to nothing. For one thing, they may have few, if any, encounters with what is defined here as something, with the result that they cannot possibly be aware of a loss in their contacts with nothing. For another, they may be aware of the loss, but feel that it is of little significance in comparison to the advantages of nothing." (xv)

First three chapters - devoted to a presentation of what is meant here by nothing.
Chapter 4 will focus on globalisation and subdimensions.
Chapter 5 presents the actual argument.
Chapter 6 presents an example.
Chapter 7 deals with the issue of loss.
Chapter 8 discusses what can be done.
Methodological issues are discussed there.

"Nothing refers to a social form that is general conceived, controlled, and comparatively devoid of distinctive substantive content. This definition carries with it no judgement about the desirability or undesirability of such a social form, or about its increasing prevalence." (3)

Example - Credit card, literally nothing is involved at the extreme: card just arrives. Let's assume a telephone call is made - this offers complexity, but is really just done through scripts. The nature of the card is determined by a computer program.

"More generally, a credit card can be seen, in this context, as a relatively empty form. That is, in itself it is little or nothing - a small rectangular piece of plastic with a few names, numbers, dates, words, a logo, and maybe a hologram. There is little of distinctive substance inherent in the card itself ... Little to distinguish one card from any others. And, of course, the nature and design of the card is a product of the central offices of a credit card bank, as is control over how the card is used." (4)

"To put this more generally and theoretically, nothing and something (and everywhere in between) are social constructions. In other words, being something or nothing is not inherent in any places, thing, person, or service. The latter are transformed into something or nothing by what people do in, or in relationship to, them. And whatever is done in, or in relationship to, them can be defined in these pages as nothing and the definitions of those involved in, or with, them who are likely to define them as something." (13)

Nothing is nothing. What does this mean:
1. No phenomena exist at the furthest extreme of the nothing end of the something-nothing continuum
2. There are some people who find meaning in this phenomena.
3. Some people struggle mightily to transform nothing into something.

### Chapter Two: Conceptualizing Nothing (and Something)
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

Essentially, something is associated with uniqueness whereas nothing is a lack of uniqueness, something generic and interchangeable.

Something <-> Nothing:
Unique to Generic
Local Geographic Ties to Lack of Local Ties
Specific to the Times to Time-less
Humanized to dehumanized
Enchanted to disenchanted.

```ad-example
title: With pizza (36)
1. Those enchanted chilies with walnut sauce are loaded with distinctive substance, while that disenchanted Domino's pizza is lacking much of the way of distinctive substance. There is aw long term trend away from meals characterized by encahnted foods to those composed entirely of disenchanted foods like microwave meals and Domino's pizza. The decline in meals made (especially from scratch) and eaten at home and the corresponding rise in premade dishes brought home from the local market, home delivery of pizza, and meals eaten out in fast-food (and other chain) restaurants aree all indicators of this dramatic change in our eating habits.
2. Enchanted foods have their advantages (a magical dining experience) but so too do disenchanted foods (the ease of obtaining that pizza)
3. And both haave their disaddvantages. Homemade chilies with walnut sauce are vaialable to only a few. Home-delivered pizzas are available to many, but they could hardly be seen as offering the kind of magnificent dining experience associated with those chilies.
4. FInally, and returning to the first of our continua since no new ones follow, the enchatned tends to be unique (homemade sausages vary from area to area, time to time, and even family to family), wheraeas the disenchanted tends to bve generic (Domino's pizza is the same from one time and place to another).

```

Evidently, globalization spawns nothing phenomena than something phenomena.

### Chapter Three:  Meet the Nullities
#### What are therefore the main arguments of this chapter?

Something to Nothing:
Unique to Generic
Local Geographic Ties to Lack of Local Ties
Specific to the Times to Time-less
Humanized to dehumanized
Enchanted to disenchanted.

##### 1 Non-Places (and places)

[[Manuel Castells]] - spaces of places moving to spaces of flow "Spaces of places tend to be unique settings characterized by rich geographic ties and an array of characteristics with deep ties to specific points in the locale's history while areas defined by flows tend to be generic, to lack geographic tie, s and to have a time-less quality ... Spaces of places are more likely to be something because they have the stability to develop a distinctive substantive base, but flows lack such stability and therefore tend to be relatively devoid of such substance." (40-41)

We can examine the non-places with the decline of the diner and growth of the fast-food restaurants. Diner's are the 'something' variant whereas fast food is cold and impersonal. Non-places are characterized by flows whereas places are concrete geographic settings.

###### The Principle of McDonaldization

Fast-food restaurants are structure din a way that generally prevents them from becoming great good places.

These structures stem from these principles (44-45):
1. Efficiency - the discovery of the optimum means to whatever end is chosen (such as the drive through window, thus limiting interaction and conversation)
2. Predictability - ensuring products and services are the same from one time and place to another. People do not want to congregate in places that are seemingly predictable.
3. Calculability - quantity rather than quality. Fast-food restaurants want the experience of their customers to be fast and cheap aand don't care about the quality
4. Non-human technology - drive-through windows, technologies, sensors,  thus creating control
5. Dehumanization - interactions are determined by scripts, superficial relationships.

##### 2 Non-things (and things)

What about the non-things offered in non-places? "A non-thing is centrally created and controlled and is lacking in distinctive substance."   (55). Non-things are everywhere we look, and are a pervasive presence in our lives. They occupy so much - they are literally with us 24/7.

The author compares a Big Mac and a Culatella ham. Same principle.

"In sum, just as we live in a world increasingly characterized by non-places, it is also one in which most of what we consume are non-things. But, as pointed out above (and indicating a greater proliferation of non-things than non-places), there are infinitely more things than places and much of what is sold in places as well as non-places are non-things. Thus, it could be argued that the proliferation of non-things (versus things) is an even more important development than the expansion of non-places (rather than places)." (59)

##### 3 non-people (and people)

How can people be a non-person? "Of  course, a non-person is a person, but one who does not act as if he or she is a person, does not interact with others as a person, and perhaps more importantly not treated by others as a person." (59-60)

The author juxtaposes a Disney costume actor and a bartender.

1. Bartenders tend to be unique, have unique personalities, no centralised organisations controlling their actions. A Disney cast member is not. There is very little distinctive.
2. Taverns and their bartenders tend to have deep ties to their local urban neighbourhood whereas Disney World has very little geographic ties, clientele is national and employees dawn all over the world. 
3. Bartender tied to a specific time. Disney characters are timeless, or at least the individuals are.
4. Bartenders develop relationships with customers and Disney employees don't.
5. Genuine enchantment is far more likely to develop between the customers than Snow White and visitors. "In fact, the theme park is one of the key sites in which simulated enchantment is produced and the relationship that exists between cast members and visitors is but one example of that. However, the efforts to produce  simulated enchantment are highly rationalized and are therefore better described as being disenchanted. The irony is that Disney World proclaims itself the "Magic Kingdom." There is, of course, magic there, but it  is of the simulated and disenchanted variety. Nothing militates more against "genuine" magic than simulation and disenchantment.

##### 4 non services (and services)

"The 4 idea of a non-service closely parallels the preceding discussions of non-people and is hard to disentangle form it. Ultimately, of course, it is non-people who are more likely to provide non-services, although it is increasingly likely that even people provide services that approach the nothing end of the continuum. And, of course, non-services are more likely to be offered in n on-places and to involve non-things, but as is true in the preceding point, non-services are also increasingly likely to be found in places and to involve things." (63)

The author juxtaposes waiters in gourmet ships versus waiters on cruise ships.

##### Nothing (and something)

"The simple fact is that it is difficult for things, people, and services to survive in non-places; they do not seem to fit with non-places.

First, people who consume in non-places are generally looking for non-things ... 

Second, in non-places consumers do not expect to encounter people, at least those who are full-fledged human beings, as employees. They expect either largely to serve themselves or to receive minimal assistance from non-people

Third, and relatedly, customers do not expect service and the clerk who offers it is not likely to be rewarded by the consumer. That is, customers are likely to brush off, or even react negatively to, offers of assistance. More important, the personalized service that is offered is not likely to lead to higher sales...

There is a kind of vicious, self-reinforcing process here...
(66-67)"


### Chapter Four: Globalization

"We start with a definition of *globalization* as "the worldwide diffusion of practices, expansion of relations across continents, organisations of social life on a global scale, and growth of a shared global consciousness."" (72)

Glocalization - the integration of global and local.

"Glocalization can be defined as the interpenetration of the global and the local resulting in unique outcomes in different geographic areas. The concept of grobalization, coined here for the first time as a much-needed companion to the notion of glocalization, focuses on the imperialistic ambitions of nations, corporations, organisations, and the like and their desire, indeed need, to impose themselves on various geographic areas. Their main interest is in seeing their power, influence, and in some cases profits grow (hence the term grobalization) throughout the world. Grobalization involves a variety of subprocesses, three of which - capitalism, Americanization, and McDonaldization..." (73)

This distinction is that they are focused on power systems, Marxism or [[Max Weber]] 's conception of modernity. Glocalization however is emphasised with postmodern social theory - local realities, distinctive fashion, and more.

(77), Glocalization:
	1. The world is growing more pluralistic. Glocalization theory is exceptionally sensitive to differences within and between areas of the world.
	2. Individuals and local group groups have great power to adapt, innovate and manoeuvre within a glocalized world. Glocalization theory sees individuals and groups as important and creative agents. 
	3. Social processes are relational and contingent. Globalization provokes a variety of reactions - ranging from nationalist entrenchment to cosmopolitan embrace - that feed back on and transform grobalization, that produce glocalization.
	4. Commodities and the media, arenas and key forces in cultural change in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries, are *not* seen as (totally) coercive, but rather as providing material to be used in individual and group creation throughout the glocalized areas of the world.

(77), Grobalization:
	1. The world is growing increasingly similar. Grobalization theory tends to minimise differences within and between areas of the world.
	2. Individuals and group have relatively little ability to adapt, innovate and manoeuvre within a grobalized world. Grobalization theory sees larger structures and forces tending to overwhelm the ability of individuals to act and react, let alone act back on the global.
	3. Social processes are largely one-directional and deterministic. Grobalization tends to overpower the local and limits its ability and react, let alone act back on the global.
	4. Commodities and the media are the key forces and areas of cultural change and they *are* seen as largely determining the self and groups throughout the grobalized areas of the world.

Glocalization: hybridization, creolization, hybridization.
Grobalization can be separated into Capitalism, Americanization, McDonaldization

**Capitalism**: Capitalist fuels the majority of non-places, non-things, non-people, non-services, and are related to globalization (US' desire to expand democracy). Not much has been written since everyone has written about it.

**McDonaldization**: The process by which the principles of the fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate society, *efficiency*, *calculability*, *predictability*, and *control*. It can be applied to all systems, and the principles that lie at the base have been exported to the rest of the world. It is a transnational process, a powerful force in the globalization of nothing.

It generates a set of advantages and models. There is also deMcDonaldization - increasing problems of McDonalds, being forced to close restaurants, fire employees and more. But Capitalism is still closely related to it.

**Americanization**: defined as the "propagation of American ideas, customs,  social patterns, industry, and capital around the world." (85). For example, Irn Bru vs Coca Cola, American film industry vs France and Britain, grammar (see Western eroticization of Chinese culture)

Why does it create nothing?
1. "First, there is simply much more Americanization than any of the competing grobal processes. As the world's greatest power, especially economically, the United States simply produces more of virtually anything that is on offer around the globe than any other organisations." (89)
2. "Second, American exporters are more likely to be able to afford to use the world's advertising and marketing systems to disseminate their products. Furthermore, advertising and marketing are themselves American specialties..." (90)
3. "In order to cater to a global market, American exporters are more likely ... To conceal the roots of these exports and to transform them into ever-emptier forms..." (90)
4. "The United States .... Is everyone's "second culture." That is, even when people are able to distinguish their own culture from American exporters, they are likely to be quite comfortable with things American. (90)

"In fact, overall, it is capitalism that is the most powerful force in the grobalization of nothing. To the degree that it can be separated from capitalism, Americanization is a more powerful force than McDonaldization. Furthermore, both capitalism and Americanization are more multidimensional forces than  McDonaldization. That is, they are more likely to bring with them both something and nothing ... The power of Americanization comes from tis strength in all of the sectors being discussed here - cultural, economical, political and institutional. " (92)

The attacks on this aren't quite declines: capitalism is expanding, anti-Americanism is strong but strong capitalist forces oppose it, a slowdown of McDonalds does not mean forces of rationalization will oppose it. Also, grobalization is a major development - states can't force out of it.



### Chapter Five: Grobalization-Glocalization and Something-Nothing

Elective affinity - there is not a necessary, law-like causal relationship between these elements. Rather the development and diffusion of one go hand in hand towards the other.

"The main reasons for the strong elective affinity between grobalization and nothing are basically the flip-sides of the reasons" (100).

"Why is there comparatively little connection between grobalization ands something? First, there is simply far less demand throughout the world for most forms of something, at least in comparison to the demand for nothing."

"Above all, there is a far greater demand throughout the world for nothing than something. This is the case because nothing tends ... To be less expensive than something with the result that more people can afford the former than the latter. Large numbers of people are also far more likely to want the various forms of nothing because their comparative simplicity and lack of  distinctiveness makes them relatively easy to appreciate. In addition, as pointed out earlier, that which is nothing, largely devoid of distinctive content, is far less likely to bother or offend those in other cultures. Finally, because of the far greater sales potential, much more money can be, and is, devoted." (101)

Nullities are easier to extract from the given locality and export to the other.

It's easier to mass-produce empty forms of nothing than rich forms of something. This is easier to conceive, eases the way towards the proliferation of the model, and the economics of the marketplace demand that massive amount of nothing that is produced be marketed and sold on a grobal basis. Economies of scale. Stock market that demands corporations produce and sell nothing to increase sales and profits from one year to the next. Corporations are encouraged to continually expand.


Glocalization too contributes towards nothing - tourism, production of native shows that are transformed into nothing to satisfy grobal tour operators and tourists. These performances are designed to place the tourists and put off as few of them as possible.

Glocalization of something still remains - derived from the global, but these tend to be costly. Glocal forms of nothing are loaded with distinctive content - but this means that consumers will find them harder to understand and appreciate, or find them offensive.

Why is there an explosion?:
1. An increasing amount of organizational and industrial capacity, entities producing nothing are no longer highly centralised
2. Media and its influence have grown enormously
3. Several of the global flows - mediascopes, financescapes, operate with nothing.

There is a strong link here to [[Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy]] - technoscapes, mediascapes, financescapes. (111-113)

### Chapter Six: Large-Scale Consumption Sites on the Internet: (135)

1. First, the Internet in general, and the large-scale consumption sites on it in particular, are powerfully affected by grobalization. That is, all of those entities that are interested in expanding their influence and increasing sales throughout the world have devoted considerable money and expertise in seeking to use the Internet to achieve their objectives.
2. The Internet can serve as a powerful agency for glocalisation, allowing local entities to play a central role so grobal inputs become glocal.

(136)

For corporations on the internet to work, operations must be effiient, predictable and calculable. The unequivocal trend stems from the basic character of the Internet in general - great care must be taken in building a website so that the site operates efficiently, predictability and calculability.

### Chapter Seven: A Few (by Necessity) Concluding Thoughts on Nothing (and Its Globalization)

The positive side of Nothing: (141-142)
1. We would need to start with the perception, and in at least some cases that the reality, that nothing is comparatively inexpensive.
2. Convenience - Lunchable, Disnsey World
3. Efficiency in how quickly they can be produced and consumed, promises easy handling for businesses and consumers
4. Monumental abundance of consumption

The negative side of Nothing:
1. There is less room for real things - "We end up with a world in which that which has, from time immemorial, been of great importance and meaning to people is either disappearing or turned over, in whole or in part, to nothing. This impoverishment of the world is paradoxically coming at the same time that the (developed) world is awash in an unprecdented number and variety of (non) places, things, people and services ... We nevertheless are deprived of the distinctive content that has always characterized places, things, people and services." (143)
2. Alienation and exploitation are too work-related, Emile Durkheim has othing to do between a gap between objective and subjective culture (cultural products versus the ability to create those products). Weber's theory of rationalization may hold evidence but it has little relevance to consumption and little to help us understand loss amid affluence. 
3. It is clear that it is possible to associate many, if not all of [examples of nothing] with the idea of loss. (144)
4. "However we can distinguish between the objective loss (there are gains, as well) being discussed here and people's feelings about those phenomena that involve such a loss. The point here is that something is lost when we go from personal loans to credit card loans ... That which is centrally conceived and controlled and lacking in distinctive content, there is a tendency to lose that which is locally conceived and contrled and is brimming with distinctive content. Thus, there is an objective, material loss that can be defined subjectively in many different ways. That is, the subjective definition need not be, indeed often is not, in accord with the objective circumstances." (149)

Why do people not notice? People have no experience of something, or that they are aware but the advantages outweigh the advantage.

Making something out of nothing: large-scale consumption sites tend to offer little or nothing in the way of interaction with the result that the ability to transform them into something that is limited.

Economic link: there is an inverse relationship between income and nothing.
- those with money can still afford to acquire various forms of something.
- Those below a certain income level cannot afford what is characterised here as nothing, can't buy mcdonalds or anything
- Affluence and prosperity must be reached before it can afford nothing (few ATMs, fast food)
- Even the wealthiest people consume nothing (salesperson at Gucci, service of a waiter at Morton's steakhouse)

### Chapter Eight: Concluding Thoughts on Globalization (and Nothing)

1. Globalization does not represent one side in the central conflict. It is far too broad a concept... (168)
2. The other side of the traditional view of that conflict is relegated to secondary importance in this conceptualisation. That is, the local, to the degree that it continues to exist, is seen as increasingly insignificant and not a key player in the dynamics of globalization ... It is difficult to find anything in the world untouched by globalization (169)
3. "Americanization ... Is likely to be resented ... Some are likely to react negatively to the growth of forms heavily saturated with Americanism within the context of their own cultures and societies. Of course, there is a large element of subjectivity in these judgements ... Empty forms ;... May be resented not only in themselves (for their emptiness), but also because they seem so American."

We can expand this analysis:
1. Public - consumers of police services - standard police practices
2. People - consumers of church goers - churches develop techniques
3. Voters  consumers of political system - principels most stable way to deal with the public.

Brands cannot be thought of nothing or something - they are centrally conceived and controlled, but also are made up of something.

"Thus, the central points to be made her are that a major reason for the existence of brands is to deal with the problem of nothingness in the world of consumption and that branding has grown exponentially because of the tremendous expansion of such nothingness." (180)

To grobalization - there is nothing we can do. People like that nothing. But we have to see what something is possible. There is a defense of ever-shrinking remnants of something at the local level, expand production of forms.

---

Problems:
1. Weight of the continua
2. Problem is traceable to the complexities in that any given phenomena will not stand in the same place in the continua
3. None of this is carved into stone.
4. Rational forms of nothing? Nope.
5. Consumers as judgemental dopes? Nope.
