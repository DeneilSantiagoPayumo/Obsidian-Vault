We need to think about power broadly rather than narrowly - in three dimensions rather than one or two.

Dahl's critique was straightforward.
The existence of a ruling elite can be strictly tested only if:
1. The hypothetical ruling class is a well-defined group
2. There is a fair sample of cases involving key politician decisions in which the ruling class run counter to the other likely group that might be suggested.
3. In such cases, the preferences of the elite regularly prevail.

He wanted to critique this Marxist ideas - power was seen as relative to several, separate single issues and bound to the local context of its exercise, the question being: how much power do the relevant actors have with respect to selected key issues in this time and place, key issues being those that affect large numbers of citizens?

Power was here conceived as intentional and active, measured by studying its exercise - conflict between interests. It claimed that since different actors and different interest groups prevailed, there is no overall ruling class and power is distributed pluralistically.

[[Schumpeter]] argued that democracy should be seen as the institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote - too unambitious, elitist, its conception of equality of power to narrowly drawn. Power, argued by [[Bachrach]] and [[Baratz]] had a 'second face' unperceived by the pluralist and undetectable by their methods of inquiry - power was not solely reflected in concrete decisions, the researcher must consider the chance that some person or association could limit decision-making to non-controversial matters, influencing community values and procedures and rituals.

Thus "to the extent that a person or group ... creates r reinforces barriers to the public airing of policy conflicts, that person or group has power."

How was the researcher to investigate such influencing? They stated that there must be observable conflict if their second face of power was to be revealed, if not - consensus on the prevailing allocation of power.

[[Gramsci]] viewed that in the contemporary social formations of the west, it was culture or ideology that constituted the mode of class rule secured by consent by means of the Bourgeoisie's monopoly over the ideological apparatus.

In this interpretation, Gramsci speaks of a psychological state.

In an alternative interpretation, Gramsci's hegemony has a material basis and consists in the co-ordination of the real, or material, interests of dominant and subordinate groups. Ideology cannot be spread on a mass scale. The consent of wage earners to the capitalist organization of society consists of a class compromise where neither the aggregate of interests of individual capitals nor the interests of organized wage-earners can be violated beyond specific limits.

Consent understood thus is then the real interests of those consenting - conditional, with limits and beyond limits, with crisis.4

[[Bringing the State Back In]] - if ordinary domination so consistently hurts the well-defined interests of subordinate groups, why do subordinates comply? Why don't they rebel or resist?
1. The premise is incorrect and subordinates rebel covertly
2. Subordinates get something in return for their subordination
3. They get esteem or identity, becoming implicated in exploitive systems
4. Subordinates are unaware of their true interests
5. Force and inertia hold subordinates in place
6. Resistance and rebellion are costly
7. All of the above

I am an idiot... that was just the introduction.

## POWER: A RADICAL VIEW

### The One-Dimensional View
This is the pluralist view. To speak of a pluralist view is to imply that the pluralists conclusion are already built in their concepts, approach and methods - but it is not and can create non-pluralist conclusions.

Their view yields elitist conclusions when applied to elitist decision-making structures, and pluralist to pluralist and so on.

[[Dahl]] - A has power over B to the extent he can get B to do something that B would not do. There is a difference between actual and potential power - it is the latter that is central to this view of power.

The stress of their conceptions is on concrete, observable behaviours - studying actual documents. Thus the pluralist methodology methodology studied actual behaviour, stressed operational definitions and turned up evidence.

The focus on observable behaviour in identifying power involves the pluralist in studying decision-making as their central task - for Dahl, power can only be examined after a series of concrete decisions.

19

Conflict here is assumed to be crucial - conflict between preferences exhibited in actions and thus to be discovered by observing people's behaviours. Interests are to be understood as policy preferences, a conflict of interest is equivalent to a conflict of preferences.

This one dimensional view of power focuses on behaviour in the making of decisions on issues over which there is an observable conflict of subjective interests seen as express policy preferences revealed by political participation

### The Two-Dimensional View

[[Bachrach]] and [[Baratz]] argue that it is restrictive and gives a misleading sanguine pluralist picture of American politics - power has two faces, one that is embodied in concrete decisions.

Power is exercised when A participates in the decision making that affect B. Power is also expressed when A devotes their time to creating socio-political values and practices that limit the scope of the political process to public consideration of issues only to A. TO the extent that A succeeds in doing this, B is prevented from bringing any issues detrimental to A.

Their central point - to the extent that a person or group creates or reinforces barriers, that person has power.

They use power in two forms:
A general way to refer to all forms of successful control by A over B, earning B's compliance. They label one of these types 'power' - the securing of compliance through sanctions.

Their typology of power embraces coercion, influence, authority, force and manipulation - coercion exists where A secures B's compliance by threat of deprivation. Influence exists where A resorts to an overt or tacit threat of deprivation, causing B to change his course of action. With authority, B complies because he recognises that A's command is reasonable. With force, A achieves his objectives by stripping him of the choice. Manipulation is a sub-context of force, compliance is forthcoming in the absence of recognition on the complier's part...

They claim that pluralist view unduly emphasises the importance of initiating, deciding and vetoing - taking no account of the fact that power might be exercised by confining the scope of decision-making to relatively safe issues. They also insist that in cases where B fails to act anticipating his action, nothing has occurred - not decisions.

For the two, it is important to identify potential issues which nondecision-making prevents from being actual: important issues may be actual. They and the pluralist both stress on observable conflict.

24

Whereas the pluralist considers as interests the policy preferences exhibited by the behaviour of all citizens who are assumed to be within the political system, they consider the preferences exhibited by the behaviour of those who are partly excluded from the political system in the form of overt or covert grievances.

Therefore, this view involves a qualified critique of the behavioural focus of the first view and it allows for consideration of the ways in which decisions are prevented from being taken on political issues over which there is an observable conflict of interests.

### The Three-Dimensional View

There is no doubt that the two-dimensional view of power represents a major advance over the one-dimensional view: it incorporate into the analysis of power relations the question of the control over the agenda of politics ...

In the first place, its critique of behaviourism is too qualified ... too committed to behaviourism ... to the study of overt, actual behaviour, of which concrete decisions in situations of conflict are seen as paradigmatic. ... it gives a misleading picture of the ways in which individuals ... groups and institutions succeed in excluding potential potential issues from the political process. Decisions are choices made by individuals between alternatives whereas the bias of the system can be mobilized ... in ways that are not chosen or the intended result of their choices,

The defenders of the status quo may be so secure and unaware of potential challengers.

The bias of a system is chosen by the socially structured and culturally patterned behaviour of groups and practices of institutions which may be manifested by individual inaction.

The first counts: the phenomenon of collective action is manifest but not attributable to particular individual's decisions or behaviours. Second, there is the phenomenon of systematic effects where the mobilization of bias results from the form of organization.

The second count of which this is inadequate is in its association of power is with observable conflict. This insistence will not do for two reasons:

The first is that two of the types of power may not involve such conflict, mainly manipulation and authority.
The second is that it is unsatisfactory to suppose that power is only exercised in situations of such conflict. A may exercise power over B by getting him to do what he does not want to do, but he exercises his power over him by influencing his wants.

This ignores that the most effective use of power is to stop conflicts from arising - power as they conceptualize it only shows up in cases of actual conflict.

The third count is closely linked to the second - its insistence that nondecision-making only exists where there are grievances which are denied entry into the political process in the form of issues. If it assumed that people feel no grievances then they have no interests that are harmed by the use of power. What is a grievance - an articulated demand, an undirected complaint, a vague sense of deprivation? Is it not the supreme use of power to prevent people from having such grievance?

Therefore, the three-dimensional view involves a critique of the first two. This can occur in absence of conflict.

### The Underlying Concept of Power

One feature that all three views of power share is their evaluative power: each arises out of and operates within a political perspective. Power is very value-dependent.

Let's consider power by Talcott Parsons - Parsons seeks to 'treat power as a specific mechanism operating to bring about changes in the actions of other units ... in the processes of social interaction' - what is it that is specific about this mechanism, what criteria of significance does Parsons use to identify a particular range of affecting as power?

![[Pasted image 20231101172054.png]]

The power of A over B is the right of A to make decisions which take precedence over those of B in the interest of the effectiveness of the collective operation as a whole.

He ties this power to authority, consensus and pursuit of collective goals, disassociating it from conflicts of interest and coercion and force. This power depends on the institutionalization of authority - the generalized medium of mobilizing commitments or obligation for effective collective action.

[[Hannah Arendt]] argues that power is:
![[Pasted image 20231101172231.png]]

It is:
![[Pasted image 20231101172240.png]]

She ties it to tradition and vocabulary, disassociating power from the 'command-obedience relationship' and 'the business of dominion' - power is consensual, needs no justification, is inherent in political community and just needs legitimacy.

33

In Parson's case the linking of power to authoritative decisions and collective goals serves to reinforce his theory of social integration as based on value consensus by concealing the range of problems that concerned 'coercion' theorists.

Arendt cares a lot about the conceptualization of power. "Tyranny ... is therefore the most violent and least powerful of forms of government"; "where power has disintegrated, revolutions are possible but not necessary...", "violence can always destroy power ... what can never grow out of it is power ... power and violence are opposites ... violence appears where power is in jeopardy"

1st place - persuasive redefinitions of power that are out of line with the central meanings of power, focus on the 'power to' not 'power over', power indicates a capacity, a facility, a ability, not a relationship: power is exercised over people and therein disappears the interest of studying power relations.

The point of these definitions reinforce certain theoretical positions but...

Parson objects to seeing power as zero-sum, arguing that the use of power may achieve objectives which all desire. Arendt argues members of a group acting in concert are exercising power - all cases of co-operative activity will be identifiable as cases of 'influence' but not of 'power.'

### The Three Views Compared

The virtues of the decision-making are obvious - pluralists studied actual behaviour. By doing this, they reproduce the bias of the system they were making. Dahl tells us a good deal about the diversity of decision making power - these issues are different and therefore no set of individuals or single elite has decision-making power.

Decision-making process is responsive to the preferences of citizens because the politicians anticipate the result of future elections. Therefore, Dahl pictures pluralist politics as diverse and open.

He never examines cases of penetration by a dissatisfied group. The thesis that indirect influence gives control over leaders is inaccurate - indirect influence can serve the influence of the elite.

This two dimensional view reveals to confining itself to studying situations where the mobilization of bias can be attributed to individuals' decisions that have the effect of preventing currently observable grievances from becoming issues. For example, when studying the racist politics in Baltimore, the two-dimensional study amounts to an account of various decisions made the mayor. Rather, the analysis is superficial because it confines itself to studying individual decisions, not how the inactivity of leaders served to keep blacks out of Baltimore politics.

The three dimensional view offers the prospect of a serious sociological and not merely personalized explanation of how political systems prevent demand from becoming political issues.

It does not follow that because it is difficult to show that power has been exercised that, we can conclude that is not.
On close inspection the locution of 'exercise of power' and 'exercising power' is problematic in two ways: it carries an individualistic and intentional connotation. The second way is that it conceals an ambiguity - suppose that A can normally affect B, his action y, is also sufficient to B to do what he would not otherwise do. Suppose that A and A1 (another partner like A) both act in relation to B simultaneously and B changes his actions - B's actions are overdetermined and both A and A1 have affected B by exercising power but the result is the same.

It is pointless to ask which of them produced the change of course as both of them exercised power, yet one cannot say that any of them made a difference to the result.

But what if A does make a difference: A, by doing x, actually gets B to do what B would not to do. X is an intervening cause that distorts the normal course of events  - by contrast A's intervention can be said to make a difference to the result. Let's call this sense of exercising power the effective sense.

Let's turn to the analysis of what is involved in identifying an exercise of power - an attribution of the exercise of power involves the double claim that A acts in a certain way and that B does what he would not otherwise do. In the case of an effective exercise of power, A gets B to do what he would not otherwise do.

...

This is so boring...

...

In brief we need to justify our expectation that B would have thought or acted differently and we need to specify the means or mechanism by which A has prevented to prevent B from doing so.

It attempts to find a way to explain things that did not happen - why was the issue of air pollution not raised as early or as effectively in some American cities as it was in others. His object is to discover why many cities and towns in the US failed to make a political issue of their air pollution - he shows that differences in the treatment of pollution cannot be attributed solely to differences in the actual pollution level.

...

He describes how pollution control is a good example of a collective good whose costs are concentrated on industry where opposition will be strong and support weak since its benefits are diffuse. These political issues tend to promote other collective issues.

Crenson's general case is that there are politically imposed limitations upon the scope of decision making, directed by the process of non-decision-making. Pluralism is no guarantee of political openness or popular sovereignty and neither the study of decision making will tell us anything about these groups that may have been shut out of a town's political life.

His analysis lies on the two-dimensional to three-dimensional level. It is a study of nondecision-making but advances beyond it, interpreting nondecision-making behaviourally, it is non-individualistic and considers institutional power, it considers which demands are prevented and prevented from being raised.

### Difficulties

Let's allude to the difficulties of the three-dimensional view.

In the first place, justifying the relevant counterfactual is not easy. The value judgement  of being poisoned is scarcely disputable. Second, the empirical hypothesis that if those citizens would not be poisoned is more than plausible 

Sometimes it is difficult to justify the relevant counterfactual - what about the exercise of power, strive for justice and equality, the cultural relativity of values? Is not this assumption ethnocentrism? 

We should examine how people react to opportunities.

In the first place, an exercise involves inaction rather than observable action. It the second place, it may be unconsciousable, but the latter suggests that nondecisions are decisions. In the third, power may be exercised by collectivises like groups or institutions.

Inaction - non-event, how can this be identified empirically? We can identify the fact that failure to act in a certain way may have consequences.

Unconsciousness - how can power be exercised without the person being aware, One may be unaware of the real motive of one's action. One may be unaware of how others interpret one's action. One may be unaware of how others interpret one's action. One may be unaware of the consequences of one's action.

The third difficulty is that of attributing an exercise of power to collectivises - when can social causation be characterised as an exercise of power, how and where the line is to be drawn between structural determination and an exercise of power on the other.

### Conclusion

The one-dimensional view of power offers a clear-cut paradigm for the behavioural study of decision-making but it takes over the bias of the political system and is blind of which the political agenda is controlled.

The two-dimensional view points the way to examining that bias and control but conceives of them too narrowly, lacking a sociological perspective.
