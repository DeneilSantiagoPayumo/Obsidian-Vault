## State Formations

This is a basic typology rather than a formal definition of the key elements of a state structure, including the modern state - an ideal type as [[Max Weber]] may have made.

The state's most notable characteristic is that it is a territorial form of political organization - a demarcation that exists only as a vague and general separation between people. The legal demarcation of state territoriality is a unique development in the evolution of political society.

The state is a sovereign entity. To possess sovereignty is to possess supreme coercive power, to possess it within a defined territorial boundary. The state therein is "the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory."

The state is an abstraction and needs the government to call the state into the actual exercise of sovereign territory. State forms of government are unique as they are the sole exerciser of sovereignty within the state's territory. Subordinate governments exist but they remain subordinate to the authority of the central government.

The state uses law to exercise its authority.

To these basic structural characteristics of territoriality, sovereignty, centralized government, and coercive law are added to ideology of legitimation - no state can survive without some operative myth to legitimize it. It is characteristic of all states that the legitimizing ideology is framed in terms of some myth of foundation by which they are formed.

Also - class stratification. It is unique to states - the active principle of social and economic ordering, control, and regulation that must occur through some system of permanent social stratification in any but the simplest of societies - the state cannot be understood apart from the class system.

Look at simple societies - no centralized government, no sovereign authority, no legally defined territory, and no system of codified law. No private property either.

Therefore, there is no class system.

Governance of such place could only operate through mechanisms of kinship of gens, clans, with rules of justice always and everywhere customary rather than statutory. Custom is the pre-state equivalent of law, the sacred and immemorial mores of a people.

Pre-state societies are composed of distinct parts. In certain cases, anthropologists call these societies segmentary.

The concept is important in understanding the formation of the modern state. It was only in the destruction of the segmentary character of medieval society that the formation of a territorial sovereign authority became possible. Clearly, state sovereignty cannot exist where real authority rests with subordinate social units. These states are still in the state building process and face the same dilemmas that the modern Western state faced in overcoming the forces of their own society.

Theories of pristine state formation are of two types: states emerge through integration or warfare. Class domination however constitutes the ultimate coercive basis of all primary and secondary states. This does not mean anything. All we do know is that state societies are class stratified and that the state is profoundly implicated in the class system.

The crucial importance of social class in the existence of the state can best be seen through a comparative analysis of the different forms of state that have existed over historical time. We focus on four: ancient city-states, ancient empire states, modern city-states and the modern Western or "nation-state".

Let's review the role of class and ideology in the states of the Near East.

The basis of early state formation was the city, the empires arising as purely secondary formation - so important the city that it constitutes the most important type of clearly definable premodern state.

The Egyptian state - the Pharaoh was God on earth. It defined the role they played - the king was to maintian harmony between the social and
