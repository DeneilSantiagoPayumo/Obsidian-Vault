# 'Unruly Places': Inner-city Comprehensives, Middle-class Imaginaries and Working-class Children.
## Article Introduction

```ad-summary
The White Paper on Education (2006) re-emphasises the importance of parents within education policy and, in particular, the key role of parental choice. However, this article argues that parental choice is an inequitable process in which privileged parents are far more likely to have and exercise choice than their less privileged counterparts. The consequences are geographies of schooling which are highly class differentiated. Compounding these inequitable geographies of schooling are invidious representations of inner-city comprehensives as unruly places, characterised by poor performance and bad behaviour. Drawing on Rob Shield’s conceptualisation of ‘places on the margin’ and the voices of working-class students, this paper attempts to present a different perspective on inner-city comprehensives from those represented in dominant middle-class imaginaries.

This paper examines the heavily politicised space of educational choice and London secondary schooling from the perspectives of the working-class students who have to go to the inner-city comprehensive schools that the White middle class reject.

The authors scope out:
- [[Butler and Robson]]'s study of the London white middle classes that share a common relationship to each other that are exclusive, and constantly fear about the failings of the state educational system.
- [[De Certeau]] (1984) writes about the differences in strategies of the powerful and powerless: practices capable of producing the outcomes desired and the less efficacious tactics of the disadvantaged.

This article follows, in addition to studying the less powerful tactics of working class citizens, also study the educational strategies of the middle-class families.

"Relational aspects of social class are foregrounded as Black and White working-class children deal with the punitive consequences of being positioned within middle-class imaginaries as 'the other' to a middle-class norm." (1192)

How do supposedly unruly working-class students understand these practices of avoidance, stigmatisation and exclusion? This paper illustrates how some children are able to develop counter-spaces of representation that challenge dominant representations of inner-city comprehensives and present more sophisticated and nuanced accounts.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

The geographies of schooling are a newly emerging field that have not been discussed.

### How is the article organised?

N/A. Author does not discuss organisation.

### What are the key takeaways?

This paper attempts to understand alternative spaces of representation that challenge 'the way things are' in our educational world - working against 'doxic acceptance' and the 'theodicy of privilege.'

[[David Sibley]] (1995) reminds us that power is expressed in the monopolisation of space, both educational and geographical, relegating weaker groups in society to less desirable places (1193). We can extend this to geographical and educational context - what are these educational places, whom do they exclude, how are these prohibitions maintained.

The intention is to understand how children, the working-class losers in the educational game, operate in the sphere of secondary schooling. What creative responses are they to generate?


## Methods and Data Sources
### How was this data collected? (p, 1993)

Fieldwork was conducted in 8 primary schools across 2 London education authorities and the 19 secondary schools to which their pupils moved.

It was conducted through 454 10-11 year old children focus groups that discussed questions like their impressions of local secondary schools, how they choose that school, and how they felt about getting in or not to their school.

We explored their fear and fantasies, and observed the strategies they employed to make sense of the anxieties.

Then they selected a sample of 45 children and followed them into their respective secondary school. These children were all interviewed at least twice.

"The social class of the children was determined through parental occupation."

### What, if any are the pitfalls behind how the data was gathered? Does the author address this?

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Middle-class fear

[[Manuel Castells]] (1977) writes about the ways in which the contradictions of class society are expressed concretely in the inner city through the formations of residential spaces and housing zones. (194)

Schools in relative proximity had very different success and failure profiles. They were thus demonised.

```ad-quote
title: 1194
"All 77 focus groups brought up the issue of demonised schools, using a wide range of derogatory terminology to describe them; terms that conjured up images of excreta: of 'crap', 'rubbish' and 'shit'. Processes of what we have called demonisation and idealisation (Lucey and Reay, 2002a) were endemic across all the focus group interviews and played a key part in children's understandings of and relationship to secondary school markets."


```

These need to be understood on interconnecting levels: structural and social as well emotional and individual. Social class, patterns of immigration, racism and geographic location connected powerfully with individual and group processes.

Location within the borough was key in determining who ended up in a demonised school.

"Oversimplification, stereotyping and labelling were all evident in the vast majority of the interviews we carried out with middle-class parents and children." (1193) Children developed these non-empirical, *gestalt* constellations of good and bad places.

"Once the children in our study had moved on to the schools they had earlier deemed to be "not good enough" or even "total rubbish", they invariably engaged in a complex psychic and spatial recoding of 'demonised' educational places. Most striking was their constant struggle to preserve a sense of themselves and their schools as "good enough." (1195)

### Re-representing 'Unruly Places'

(below, 1196) 

This section focuses on five students who went on to the 'demonised' secondary schools in our study. These schools represented second and in some cases their third choice. These schools were at or near the bottom of LEA league tables - undersubscribed. One school was in special measures while another closed down and opened under a new name.

Shaun: "Sutton Boys isn't the best school in the area but it ain't the worst. I'd say it's like in the middle ... Other kids diss it, but they don't really know what it's like."

We can see here a complex and at times contradictory interweaving of ambivalence, defensiveness and pride. 

Lindsey: (in response to being asked about the average child) "A mixture of a lot of things, a bit loud but sometimes a bit quiet and successful, maybe, I hope." (in response to being asked about it having a lot of rough kids) "Yes but I don't think that's right because I'm not from a very good background because around my area there's always police up there and there's lots of violence and drugs but we've got a nice flat. We live in a block of flats that's very unhygienic and scruffy but inside we've got a nice flat so you can't say rough just from the outside."

Here we have a repositioning and opening up of spaces of representation. Lindsey expresses a reflexive understanding that disrupts stereotypes and also reveals the "partiality of dominant representation of 'place-images' (Shields, 191) that work to conceal the complex heterogeneity that characterises schools in areas with a multiplicity of ethnicities and myriad gradations of poverty and affluence jostling side by side." (1197)

Jordan, Kirsty and Mustafa went t the same comprehensive and were incredibly scared - that it is full of drugs, gang leaders and violence:

After a year at Chiltern all three children constructed a complex nuanced picture of their school that included good as well as bad aspects.

"They were engaged in a tactical rehabilitation of places the middle class avoided. Yet, there was a strong recognition of the stigma associated with going to a sink school and, at times, an abhorrence mingled with fascination at the deviant behaviours of a small minority." (1197)

"Combining the two [Working classness and educational success in inner-city working-class schooling] generates psychic costs, involving individuals not only in a considerable amount of academic labour but also a degree of psychic reparative work if they are to avoid what Bourdieu terms "the duality of the self" ... for Bourdieu, the combination of working-class background and educational success often generates a habitus divided against itself, both deeply ambivalent and consigned to successive allegiances and multiple identities." (1198)

Here, children reframe their schools to transform their stigmatised properties and recalibrates them in order to overlook stigmatised properties. These children try to challenge hegemonic representation of educational success. There are similarities with [[Loic Wacquant]] and [[Wilson]] (2005) write with the Black ghetto-dwellers in Chicago: they are evolving and striving against formidable odds to survive but they still remain the losers in the educational game.
