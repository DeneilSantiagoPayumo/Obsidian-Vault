## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
The coloniality of power is understood by Anibal Quijano as at the constituting crux of the global capitalist system of power. What is characteristic of global, Eurocentered, capitalist power is that it is organized around two axes that  Quijan terms "the coloniality of power" and "modernity." The coloniality of power in
the basic and universal social classification of the population of the planet in terms of the idea of race, a replacing of relations of superiority and inferiority established through domination with naturalized understandings of inferiority and superiority. 

In this essay, Lugones introduces a systemic understanding of gender constitcolonial/modernity in terms of multiple relations of power. This gender system has a light and a dark side that depict relations, and beings in relation as deeply different and thus as calling for very different patterns of violent abuse. Lugones argues that gender itself is a colonial introduction, a violent introduction consistently and contemporarily used to destroy peoples, cosmologies, and communities as the building ground of the "civilized" West.

Colonialism imposed a new gender system and introduced many genders and gender itself as a colonial concept.

How do we understand heterosexuality as not merely normative but consistently perverse when violently exercised across the colonial modern gender system? How do we understand heterosexualism as tied to a violent domination that marks the flesh?

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The Coloniality of Power

"[[Quijano]]  understands that all power is structured in relations of domination, exploitation, and conflict as social actors fight over control of "the four basic areas of human existence: sex, labour, collective authority and subjectivity/intersubjectivity, their resources and products" (20012002,1)." (190)

This struggle for sexual access, he argues, defines the domain of sex/gender. But this assumes the global, Eurocentric, capitalist understanding of what gender is about.

"The coloniality of power introduces the basic and universal social classification of the population of the planet in terms of the idea of 'race'. The invention of race is a pivotal turn as it replaces the relations of superiority and inferiority established through domination ... it makes conceptual room for understanding historical disputes over control of labour, sex, collective authority and intersubjectivity as developing in processes of long duration, rather than understanding each of the elements as predating the relations of power." (190).

This classification was imposed on the entire planet, constituting an all encompassing phenomenon. It permeates all control of sexual access, collective authority, labour and such - all control over sex are articulated over it.

The cognitive need of capitalism include measurement, quantification, externalisation to control the relation among people, nature, property, means... And thus "this way of knowing was imposed on the whole of the capitalist world as the only valid rationality and as emblematic of modernity." (192)

Quijano restricts gender to the organisation of sex, its resources, and products - presupposing whom controls what and who became constituted as resources. Dispute over control of sex is a dispute among men about men's control of resources - men do not seem understood as the resources in sexual encounters, women are not thought to be disputing for control over sexual access. THe differences are thought of in how society reads reproductive biology.

### Intersexuality

The assignations reveal that what is understood to be biological sex is socially constructed - from the late nineteenth century till WW 1, reproductive function was considered a woman's central characteristic. Now, there are a large number of factors - chromosomes, gonads, external morphology, internal morphology, hormonal patterns, phenotype, assigned sex and self-identified sex.

XY infants with 'inadequate' penises must be turned into girls because society believes the essence of manhood is the ability to penetrate a vagina and urinate while standing. XX infants with 'adequate' penises, however, are assigned the female sex because society and many in the medical community believe that the essence of womanhood is teh ability to bear children rather than the ability to engage in satisfactory sexual intercourse.

Intersex individuals are frequently surgically and hormonally turned into male or females. The law itself does not recognise that either.

Sexual dimorphism has an important 'light side' characteristic of the colonial and modern gender system, with those in the dark side not understood in the same way. Intersexed individuals were recognised in many tribal societies prior to colonization without assimilation to the sexual binary.

Thus, for Allen, the inferiorization of Indian females is thoroughly tied to the domination and transformation of tribal life. The destruction of the gynocracies is crucial to the "decimation of populations through starvation, disease, and disruption of all social, spiritual, and economic structures" (42). The program of degynocratization requires impressive "image and information control." Thus "recasting archaic tribal versions of tribal history, customs, institutions and the oral tradition increases the likelihood that the patriarchal revisionist versions of tribal life, skewed or simply made up by patriarchal non-Indians and patriarchalized Indians, will be incorporated into the spiritual and popular traditions of the tribes" (42).

Among the features of the Indian society targeted for destruction were the two-sided complementary social structure; the understanding of gender; and the economic distribution that often followed the system of reciprocity. The two sides of the complementary social structure included an internal female chief and an external male chief. The internal chief presided over the band, village, or tribe, maintaining harmony and administering domestic affairs. The red, male, chief presided over mediations between the tribe and outsiders (Allen 1986/1992, 18). Gender was not understood primarily in biological terms.

Allen has not only enabled us to see how gender is in terms of the organization of the economy and of collective authority, but she has also revealed that the production of knowledge is gendered, as is the very conception of reality at every level. Allen supported the questioning of biology in the construction of gender differencesand introduces the important idea of gender roles being chosen and dreamt. Allen also showed us that the heterosexuality characteristic of gender relations is produced, mythically constructed. But heterosexuality is not just biologized in a fictional way; it is compulsory and permeates the whole of the coloniality of gender in the renewed, large sense. In this sense, global, Eurocentered capitalism is heterosexualist. I think it's important to see, as we understand the depth and force of violence and the dark sides of the colonial/modern gender system,  that this heterosexuality has been consistently perverse, violent, and demeaning, turning people into animals and turning white women into reproducers of "the (middle or upper) class."

### The Colonial/Modern Gender System

"Those changes were introduced through slow, discontinuous, and heterogeneous processes that violently inferiorized colonial women." (201)

"Indeed, beginning from that characterization [of white bourgeois women being weak in body and mind] white bourgeois feminists theorized white womanhood as if all women were white. It is part of their history that only white bourgeois women have consistently counted as women so described in the West ... They were also understood to be animals in a sense that went further than the identification of white women with nature, infants and small animals." (202)

Colonized females had none of the privileges that bourgeois white women had. Erasing any history, white feminism wrote white women large. They did not understood intersectional terms and presumed a sisterhood.

"Erasing any history, including oral history, of the relation of white to non-white women, white feminism wrote white women large. Even though historically and contemporarily white bourgeois women knew perfectly well how to orient themselves in an organisation of life that pitted them for very different treatment than nonwhite or working-class women." (203)

"Historically, the characterization of white European women as fragile and sexually passive opposed them to nonwhite, colonized women, including female slaves, who were characterized along a gamut of sexual aggression and perversion, and as strong enough to do any sort of labour." (203)

"The light side constructs gender and gender relations hegemonically, ordering only the lives of white bourgeois men and women and constituting the modern/colonial meaning of men and women. Sexual purity and passivity are crucial characteristics of the white bourgeois females who reproduce the class and colonial and racial standing of bourgeois, white men ... Banning of white bourgeois women ... From most control over means of production." (206)

"The gender system is heterosexualist, as heterosexuality permeates racialized patriarchal control over production, including knowledge production and over collective authority. Heterosexuality is both compulsory and perverse among white bourgeois men and women since the arrangement does significant violence to the powers and rights of white bourgeois women and serves to reproduce control over production and white bourgeois women are inducted into this reduction through bounded sexual access." (206)

That is the light side of the gender system that constructs gender and gender systems hegemonically. The other side, we get the reduction of animales, anafemales and the "third gender" - reduction to animality, forced sex with white colonizers, deep labour colonization.
