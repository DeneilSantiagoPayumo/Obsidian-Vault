## The Poverty of Philosophy.
These extracts where an attempt to instil doctrinal cohesion into the League of the Just as it turns into a communist league. Proudhon rejected Marx as he found him too dogmatic. In this book, Marx criticizes Proudhon's economic policies, his attempts to use Hegel's dialectics, and refutes Proudhon's view of the uselessness of strikes.

### First Observation
M. Proudhon distinguishes himself from other economist in multiple ways:
"Economists explain how production takes place in the above-mentioned relations, but what they do not explain is how these relations are produced."

He takes these relations for principles, and puts into order these thoughts.  M. Proudhon's material is the dogma of the economist - the moment we cease to pursue the historical movement of production relations, the moment we want to se in these categories no more than ideas, spontaneous thoughts, that we are forced to attribute to this to reason.

Impersonal reason is forced to turn heads or tails. For Hegel, we give the formula: -affirmation, negation and negation of the negation. Instead of the ordinary individual with his ordinary manner of speaking and thinking, we have nothing but this ordinary manner in itself - without the individual.

It is surprising that for everything, in its abstraction, presents itself as a logical category. If you let drop little by  little that encompasses the individuality of a house, you end up with nothing but a body - the limits of the body, nothing but a space and finally the dimensions - pure category.

Thus, by making abstractions and analysis, these things are the embodiments of logical categories. 

[Section cut]

If one finds logical categories the substance of all things, one has found in the logical formula of movement the absolute method.

In this method, Hegel speaks: 'Method is the absolute, unique ... force, which no object can resist.'

This method is the abstraction of movement, following on movement in abstract condition. How does reason tend to affirm itself in this category?

This is the business of reason itself. Once it has posed itself as a thesis, it splits up into contradictory thoughts - the struggle therein between these two antagonistic methods composing the dialectic method.

Apply this method to the categories of political economy, and you have the metaphysics of political economy - the economic category that everybody knows. Yet Mr. Proudhon has yet not risen above the simple thesis and antithesis. 

## Second Observation

Economic categories are only the theoretical expressions, the abstractions of the social relations of production. These definite social relations are closely bound with productive forces, and with men acquiring new productive forces, men change their mode of production and social relations.

The men who establish their social relations in conformity with their material productivity produce principles, ideas and categories. These ideas are as little eternal as the relations they express - transitory products. 

There is a continual movement of growth in productive forces, of destruction in social relations.

## Third Observation

The production relations of every society forms a whole. 

Mr Proudhon considers economic relations in social phases, resulting from each other like the antithesis from the thesis - despite that, the only drawback is that when he comes to examine a single one of these phases, he cannot explain it without having recourse to other relations of society, forgetting that these new social forces are the same age as the firth.

This to arrive at the constitution of value, the basis of economic evolutions, he could not do it without the division of labour, competition and so on. In constructing the edifice of an ideological system, the limbs of the social system are dislocated - limbs of society converted to many different societies. how can one formula of movement explain the structure of society?

### Fourth Observation

The good and bad side, advantages and drawbacks, form the contradiction in every economic category.
The problem to be solved thus - to keep the good side, while eliminating the bad.

Direct slavery is just a pivot of bourgeois industry as machinery, as without slavery we have no cotton, it is slavery that gave the colonies their value - colonies that created world trade, and it is world trade that is the precondition of large-scale industry.

Thus slavery has always existed among the institutions of the people. Modern nations have been able only to disguise slavery in their own countries, but they have imposed it without disguise upon the New World.

Hegel has no problems to formulate: only dialectics. 
What constitutes dialectical movement is the co-existence of two contradictory sides, their conflict and fusion into a new category. The very setting of the problem of eliminating the bad side cuts short the dialectic setting.

## Fifth Observation

From the movement of the process of dialectic movement reducing the simple process of opposing the good to the bad, these categories suddenly lose spontaneity, no longer decomposed into categories.

Let us admit with M. Proudhon that real history is the historical sequence in which ideas ... have manifested themself.

Each principle has had its own century to manifest itself. The principle of authority ha the 11th century, individualism - eighteenth century. It was the century that belonged to the principle and not vice-versa. When we are forces to examine what men were like in the 11th, their needs, modes of production, we ask what were the relations between man and man that created these conditions. To answer this, you must draw up the real history of men, by the moment you present men as the actors, you arrive at the real-starting point.

## Sixth Observation

If we concede that economic relations are eternal principles ... we shall concede further that these laws, principles, categories ... slumbered 'in the impersonal reason of humanity.' So great is the force of contradictions which function and which make M. Proudhon function that he is forced to deny the successive appearance of social relations.

Human reason does not create truth, only unveil it. Such truths it has unveiled are incomplete and contradictory - therefore, economic categories are incomplete and contain only the germ of contradiction. Economic relations, which realize on earth these incomplete categories, are consequentially contradictory in themself, presenting two sides: good *and* the bad.

To find the complete truth is to annihilate the contradiction.

```ad-quote
title: Quote from Hegel (Vol. 1, p. 133)
collapse: closed
"At first, society states a primary fact, puts forward a hypothesis ... whose antagonistic results develop in the social economy ... the deduction of ideas, splits up into two currents, one of useful effects, the other of subversive results. To bring harmony into the constitution of this two-sided principle ... society gives rise to a second ... followed by a third; and progress of social genius will take in this manner."

```

As antithesis was turned into an antidote, the thesis becomes a hypothesis. Human reason, having incomplete vision, encounters at every step new problems - every new thesis which discovers in absolute reason (and is the negation of the first thesis) becomes a synthesis, which it accepts rather naively as the solution of the problem. It perceives that all its theses and syntheses are merely contradictory hypotheses.

Hypotheses are made only in the view of an aim. The aim of social genius (in M. Proudhon) was to eliminate the bad, so why does the social genius aim at equality rather than inequality? This could be due to M. Proudhon's ideal which *is* equality,  and assumes therein that all economic relations are invented purely for equality. 

Henceforth the good side of an economic relation is that which affirms equality, the bad side that negates it and affirms inequality. Every new category is a hypothesis of the social genius to eliminate the inequality created by the preceding hypothesis.

In short, equality is '*the primordial intention, the mystical tendency, the providential aim* that the social genius has. *Providence* is what makes M. Proudhon move moreso than reason.

But providence means nothing. It is a rhetoric form of paraphrasing facts.

It is a fact that Scotland acquired value by development of the English that created new outlets for wool. To do this, arable land had to be transformed. For this to occur, the estates must be concentrated - tenants driven, small holdings destroyed. Therefore, through transformation property in Scotland has resulted in the driving out of men by sheep.

The tendency towards equality belongs to our society - to say now that former centuries with different needs and means of production worked for equality is to misunderstand them. Economists know very well that the very thing that was for the one a finished product was for the other but the raw material for new production.

Suppose (as M. Proudhon assumes) that social genius produced feudal lords with the providential aims of transforming the settlers into responsible and equally-placed workers and you will have effected a substitution of aims and of persons worthy  of providence in order to give itself the pleasure of driving men by sheep.

## Seventh and Last Observation

Economists have a singular method of procedure: there are only two kinds of institutions, artificial and natural. The institutions of feudalism are artificial, those of the bourgeoise are natural institutions. When modern day economists suggest that these relations are natural, they imply that the relations of which wealth is created developed in conformity with the laws of nature, Therein, these relations are eternal laws.

Feudalism also had its proletariat - serfdom. Feudal production also had two antagonistic elements, designed by the 'good side' and 'bad side' of feudalism. It is the bad side that produces the movement that makes history through struggle, assuming the benefits of feudalism patriarchal life of towns, the condition of domestic industry and so on... creates a problem of eliminating the shadow of history, the serfdom, anarchy, privileges, that would've halted the development of the bourgeoise.

After the triumph of the bourgeoise, there is no question of the 'good' or 'bad' side of feudalism - the bourgeoise took possession of the productive forces, and old economic forms, the corresponding civil relations - were smashed.

Therefore, feudal production must be considered a mode of production founded on antagonism - for true analysis, it must be shown how wealth was produced in antagonism, how the productive forces were developed as the same time as class antagonisms, how the 'drawback' of society kept growing. This is better than saying that laws are eternal, corresponding to a definite development of men.

The bourgeoise begins with a proletariat which is a relic of the proletariat of the feudal times. The bourgeoise, over time, develops its antagonistic character - bosoming a new proletariat, a modern proletariat, creating a struggle. If all the members of the modern bourgeoise have the same interests as they form class as against another class, they have antagonistic interests.

As the more antagonistic character comes to light, the economists (bourgeoise representation) come into conflict with their own theory.

We have:
1. Fatalist economists, indifferent to the drawbacks of bourgeoise production, those like Adam Smith that represent a bourgeoise which works only to purge 'feudal taints', only passing 'accidental suffering', having no other mission than showing how wealth is acquired in relations, forming these relations for law. Poverty is merely the pang. 
2. The romantics belong to our age: in which the bourgeoisie is in direct opposition to the proletariat, where poverty is engendered as in great abundance as wealth. They take a disdainful glance at the human machines who manufacture wealth.
3. The humanitarian schools therein sympathizes with the bad side, easing its conscience by deploring the distress of the proletariat, counselling workers to be sober, advising the bourgeoise to put a reasoned anchor into production.
4. The philanthropic school is the humanitarian school calculated to perfection, denying the necessity of antagonism, elevating men, realising theory so far it is distinguished from practice. It is easy to make an abstraction of the contradictions that are met - this theory becoming idealised reality. They are more bourgeois than others.

Just as the economists are the scientific representatives of the bourgeois, the socialists and communists are theoreticians of the proletarian class, as the proletariat is not developed enough to be a class, and not assumed a political character, its productive forces not developed enough to catch a glimpse of the way in which we could emancipate ourselves.

## On Strikes

A general rise in wages can never produce a general rise in the price of good. As the relation of manual labour to fixed capital is not the same in different activities, industries will employ a greater mass of capital and fewer workers. in the opposite case, where the price of good is not lowered, profit will rise highly. As machines don't earn wages, some industries will be less effected by wage increases.

The rise and fall of profits and wages expresses merely the proportion in which capitalist and workers share in the product of a day's work, without influencing in most instances the price of the product.

In England, strikes have given rise to the new machines - machines are the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialized labour.

Large-scale industry concentrates a crowd of people unknown to another where competition divides their interest, but the maintenance of wages, this common interest, unites them in a common though of resistance - combination. Combination therefore stops competition among workers. If the first aim was the maintenance of wages, they combine into groups as capitalists start to repress them.

Economic conditions have transformed the mass of the country into workers - creating common situations, common interests. The mass is thus a mass as against capital, but not yet for itself - the struggle, in which the mass becomes united.

In the bourgeoise we have two phases to distinguish: that in which it is a class under the regime of feudalism and absolute monarchy, overthrowing feudalism and monarchy to make society into a bourgeois society.

An oppressed class is the vital condition for every society founded on the antagonism of classes - the emancipation of the oppressed class implying the creation of a new society. For the new oppressed class to emancipate itself, it is necessary that the productive powers already acquired and that existing social relations should no longer be capable of existing side by side.

Does this mean that after a fall of Capitalism there will be a new class domination culminating in a new political power? The condition for emancipation of the working class is the abolition of every class. The working class will substitute for the old civil society. Meanwhile, the antagonism between the proletariat and bourgeoisie is a struggle of class against class. Is it surprising that a society founded on the opposition of classes should culminate in brutal contradiction, the shock of body against body. It is only in an order of things where there is no more classes and social evolutions should cease to be political revolutions.

# Moralizing Criticism and Critical Morality
This article was written in refutation of Karl Heinzen, a 'true socialist' who propagated the idea of a republic based on humanity. Marx points to the importance of classes in any social analysis and explains in what sense the proletariat must act as allies of the bourgeoisie in the next upheaval.

Mr. Heinzen exclaims that this "communistic narrow mindness" divides men into classes according to their handicraft. Marx left the possibility that 'humanity' is not determined by class or wealth - common sense transforms the class distinction into the 'length of the purse' and the class antagonism into trade quarrels.

It is possible that particular individuals are not influenced in their attitude by the class to which they belong. These nobles have at least joined a class, but Mr. Heinzein sees all classes melt away against the idea of 'humanity.' These narrow-minded communists see not only the political distinction of prince and subject, but also social distinction of classes - (Can a prince really rise above princedom?)

It is known that after the July Revolution, the Bourgeoise in its September laws, make 'the incitement of class against class', to which imprisonment and fines were attached. In the process of inciting class against class, German writers are incarcerated in fortresses.

The well-meaning Mr. Heinzen only fears that the communists are 'seeking to assure the princes a revolutionary', as though radicals are in secret alliances with the Catholics; French liberals, democrats and legitimists, Mr. Heinzen the communists with the princes.

Germany has her own Christian-Germanic plague: seeking to establish its political power when in all developed countries the bourgeoise is engaged in the most violent struggle with the working class.

In this country, where the political poverty of monarchy still exists with semi-feudal orders and conditions, there exists on the other hand, the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the working class - the bourgeoisie finding itself in a relation of antagonism to the proletariat before it has established itself politically as a class.

Workers know that the bourgeoise must not only make them more concessions than absolute monarchy, but that the bourgeoise will create against its will the conditions for the unity of the workers.

## Manifesto of the Communist Party. 
Page 246

A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism.
1. Communism is acknowledged by all European powers to be a power.
2. It is high time [they should] ... publish their views.

### Bourgeois and Proletarians
The history of society is the history of class struggle.
In early epochs of history, we find a complicated arrangement of society into various orders.
The modern bourgeois society has sprouted class antagonism.

The discovery of America, rounding of the Cape ... lead to a revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.

Feudal systems didn't suffice for growing demand, thus the manufacturing system took its place. Markets kept growing, demand kept rising - modern industry has established the world-market for which the discovery of America paved the way.

Each step of the bourgeoise was accompanied by a political advance of that class: an oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility. The Bourgeoise has played a big part - putting an end to feudal relations, tearing itself from feudal ties that bound man to his natural superiors. It has converted the physician, lawyer, priest, poet into paid wage-labourers.

The bourgeoise cannot exist without revolutionizing the instruments of production, and relations of production, and relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of thoughts and opinions are swept away.

This need of a constantly expanding market chases the bourgeoise over the surface of the globe. The bourgeoise has through its exploitation of the world-market given a character to production and consumption in every society. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life-and-death question for all civilized nations, nations that work up indigenous raw material or raw material drawn from the remotest zones. Our engless demands wants of products from distant lands and climes, we have growing forces of production - creations of individual nations become common property.

The bourgeoise by the rapid improvement of the instruments of production has grown, drawing all nations into civilization.

It has subjected the country to the rule of the towns, creating enormous cities. It has made the country dependant on the towns, barbarians on civilized societies, the East on the West. It has centralized politics - independent provinces become lumped into one nation.

The bourgeoise through means of production and exchange, was firstly generated in feudal society - when at a certain stage in the development of the means, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already productive forces.

What stepped in was competition and a constitution adapted to it.

Something similar is happening. The bourgeoise cannot control our world.

There is too much civilization, too much subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeoisie society. The conditions of bourgeoisie are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them - so they do away with this through the enforced destruction of productive forces, or the conquest of new markets.

The weapons with which bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are turned against the bourgeoisie itself.

The proletariat is a class who live only so long as they find work. These labourers who sell themselves are a commodity, exposed to the fluctuations of the market.

The work of proletariats have lost individual character and charm - an appendage of the machine. The cost of production of a workman is restricted to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance and for the propagation of his race. The price of a commodity and of labour is equal to its cost of production.

Modern industry has converted the workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Labourers are organized like soldiers. They are enslaved by the machine and by the Bourgeoise.

The less skill implied in labour, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women: differences of ages and sex have no social validity for the working class. No sooner does the bourgeoisie receive his wage does he end up losing his money through the portions of the bourgeoisie: the landlord, shopkeeper, pawnbroker.

Thus, the middle class sink to the proletariat as their capital does not suffice for the scale modern industry is carried on.

The proletariat goes through stages of development - beginning struggle with the bourgeoise, carried on by individual labourers, the workpeople of a factory, operatives of one trade, in one locality, against the individual bourgeoise who exploit them - they smash instruments of production, set factories ablaze.

They are an incoherent mass scattered over the country. They may unite to form more compact bodies, which at this stage they do not fight their enemies but the enemies of their enemies (the landowners, monarchy, the petit bourgeoisie).

With the development of industry, the proletariat grow in number and are more concentrated. Conditions of life are more equalized. The machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour. Competition among bourgeoisie and improvements of machines make their livelihood more precarious, so thus the workers begin to form combinations, club together to keep up the rate of wages.

The fruit of their battle lies in the union. This organizes the proletariats into a political party. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle: with the aristocracy, portions of the bourgeoisie whose interests become antagonistic to the progress of industry, to foreign countries - appealing to the proletariat. In this case, the bourgeoisie furnishes the proletariats the weapons for fighting the Bourgeoisie.

Entire sections of the ruling class are precipitated into the proletariat, providing it with elements of enlightenment and progress.

When the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution within the ruling class - it will cut a portion of itself to join the revolutionary class. The proletariat is the special and essential product - the lower middle class, who fight the bourgeoisie to save their existence, are reactionary as they roll back the wheel of history.

Their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property. 

The struggle of the proletariat is first national: but in the general phases, we trace the struggle of the proletariat. Every form of society has been based on antagonism - in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to itself that it can continue it slavish life - the serf raised himself to membership in the commune, as the petit bourgeoise did to the bourgeoise - the modern labourer sinks deeper into the conditions of his own class, becoming a pauper.

When it becomes evident that the bourgeoise is unfit to assure us we won't become slaves, we will rise.

### Proletarians and Communists

The theory of the communists may be summed up in a single sentence: abolition of private property.
Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property - the property of the petty artisan and small peasant?
Modern bourgeois private property.
Does wage-labour create any property? No, it creates capital.

Capital is a social power. When capital is converted into common property, personal property is not turned into social property, it just loses its class-character - its social character.

The price of wage-labour is minimum age. The wage-labourer then just reproduces a bare existence. 

In bourgeois society, living labour is but a mean to increase accumulated labour. The past here dominates the present, in a communist society, the past dominates the past. In bourgeois society, capital is interdependent and has no individuality while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.

The abolition of this state is called by the bourgeois abolition of individuality and freedom.

Private property work will not cease - for if done so, bourgeois society would have long gone to the dogs, as those who work have nothing and vice versa.

What about the family? It is based on private gain - stopping the exploitation of children.

What about education? Education is under the trap of the ruling class, the hallowed co-relation of parent and child disgusts Marx as to rescue children from articles of commerce and instruments of labour.

Women then are just seen as a mode of production, that creates tools of production.

The working men have no country. The proletariat must acquire political supremacy, become the leading class of the nation, and *be* the nation.

## Socialist and Communist literature 

Feudal socialism - vocation of the aristocracies of France and England was to write against modern bourgeois society.
The aristocracy was obliged as, to gain sympathy, formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class.
This arose feudal socialism - in being pointed out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalist forget that they were exploited under different circumstances. In showing this, that under their role the modern proletariat never existed, they forget that the modern bourgeoise is the necessary offspring of their own society.

In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class.

Petty-Bourgeois Socialism - feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie. In countries where modern civilization has become fully developed, a new class of petit bourgeoise has been formed - fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie. The individual members of this class are constantly being hurled down into the proletariat by actions of competition.

In France, where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population, writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use, in their criticism of the regime, the standard of peasant and petty bourgeoise.

This school of socialism dissected the hypocritical apologies of economists, the concentration of capital and land in a few hands, the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat...

In this positive aims, this form of Socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange, and with them old property relations and the old society.

True Socialism - Socialist literature, consisting of bringing new French ideas into harmony with ancient philosophical consciences.

These ideas were annexed through translation - the German literati reversed this process, writing philosophical nonsense beneath French original.

The French socialist therein was emasculated, ceased in the German hands to express the struggle of one class.

Man in reality belongs to no class, has no reality only exists in the realm of philosophical fantasy.

By this, the long wished opportunity was offered to 'True' Socialism by confronting the political movement with socialist demand., preaching to the masses. German Socialism forgot whose silly echo it was.

While 'True' Socialism served the government as a weapon for fighting the German Bourgeoise, it directly represented a reactionary interest - the interest of the German Philistines. 

To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany.

Conservative socialism - economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class.

The socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers resulting from them - the existing state of society minus revolutionary and disintegrating elements. A bourgeoisie without a proletariat.

A second and more practical form of this socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement by showing only a change in the material conditions of existence can save them. By changing the material conditions no means understands the abolition of the bourgeois relations of production.

The bourgeois is a bourgeois - for the benefits of the working class.

Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism
The first direct attempts of the proletariats to make their own ends failed, owing then to their undeveloped state. The literature that followed had a reactionary character.

The founders of these systems see the class antagonism but the proletariat in their infancy offer a spectacle without any initiative or political movement.
Capitalism has not yet allowed them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.

The proletariat, as the most suffering class, is the only class existing for them - they want to improve the conditions of every member of society, and so appeal to society at large.

They wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, paving the way for the social gospel.

In proportion as the modern class struggle develop and take shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest, and these attacks, lose all practical value. The originators of these systems form mere reactionary sects, holding fast by the original view of the master.

### Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition parties

The communists fight for immediate aims and of the future.
They never cease to instil into the working class the recognition of this hostile antagonism.
They support every movement..

## Critique of the Gotha Programme

*So, the Gotha program is a letter written to the Social Democratic Worker's Party of Germany, discussing their program for a forthcoming party congress. They planned to unite with the General German Workers' Association to form a party.

In this section of his manifesto, Marx is talking about democracy.
The German Worker's party is striving for 'a free state'

It is not a goal for workers to make the state 'free', freedom consists in transforming the state from an agency superior to society into one subordinated to it - today, state forms are free to the extent they limit the 'freedom of the state'.

The German Workers' Party reveals that its socialism is not true, treating the state as 'an independent entity' with its own 'foundations in ideas, morality and freedom.'

Present-day society is Capitalist, existing in all civilised countries, modified through the historical development of each country - the state changing with each country's borders. At the very least, all of these states are based on modern bourgeois society.

So what transformation will the state undergo in a communist society?

Between capitalist and communist society, there is a period of transformation of one to the other - correspondingly, a period of transition where the state can be nothing else but the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The political demands of [the German Worker's Party] are nothing but the democratic litany known over: universal suffrage, legislative initiative, civil rights, echoes of the bourgeois People's Party. These public demands, should they not be exaggerated, have already been realised but the state they belong to is not in the German Empire but in Switzerland or the US. A 'future state' of this is a 'present-day state', outside its bounds.

But the German Worker's Party wants to work within 'the present-day national state', else most of its demands would be meaningless since you demand only what you haven't gotten yet, these demands are only appropriate in a democratic republic. 

What they mean by 'state' is the governmental machine, the state as an organisation, distinguished through the division of labour. The German Worker's Party demands 'equal and elementary education.'

But this underlies a misconception - can education be *equal* for all classes, or are they demanding that the upper classes reduce their education? Their other demands, 'free tuition' and 'attendance' exists already in Switzerland and the US for elementary school, so therein the upper class *can* cover their costs of education from general tax receipts. They should at least have demanded technical schools in conjunction with elementary school. Additionally, education *by* the state is objectionable as the state should have no interference with the people's education. This program is infested by this servile belief in the state, a compromise in the faith of democracy removed from Socialism.

Other misconceptions: 'freedom of conscience' - everyone should be able to stick to their religious needs, but the workers' party should have done more to suggest that Bourgeois 'freedom of conscience' is nothing other than the toleration of all possible types of religious unfreedom of conscience.

'Normal working day' - in no other country has the workers limited themselves to a vague demand.

'Limitations on female and child labour' - the standardisation must already have limitations on female labour else they become injured. They should have said so. They also should've been clear on the age limit of the 'prohibition of child labour', as a general prohibition is incompatible with the existence. An early combination of productive labour with instruction can transform society.

'State supervision of industry in the factory, workplace and home.' - should be taken for dereliction of duty only for the inspectors.

'Regulation of prison labour' - there is no intention to make common criminals competitive by treating them like animals.

'An effective law of liability' - what does this even mean? These laws would only come about *after* their rights have been infringed.
