## THE FORETHOUGHT

Here lies many things which ... may show the strange meaning of being black.
The meaning is not without interest to you ... for the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the colour line.

I have sought here to sketch ... the spiritual world in which ten thousand thousand Americans live and strive. First, in two chapters I have tried to show what Emancipation meant to them, and what was its aftermath. In a third chapter I have pointed out the slow rise of personal leadership and criticized candidly the leader who bears the chief burden of his race today.

The other two chapters I have sketched swift outline the two worlds within and without the Veil, and thus have come to the central problem of traniing men to life.

I have in two chapters studied the struggles of the massed mill of the black peasantry ... in another I have sought to make clear hte rpesent relations of the son of master or man.

I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may view fainly its deeply recesses - the meaning of its religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls.

## CHAPTER 1: OF OUR SPIRITUAL STRIVINGS:

There is an unasked question - they [white people] approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way [...] instead of saying directly, How does it feel to be a problem? They say, I know an excellent colored man in my town.

And yet, being a problem is a strange experience
Till one girl, a tall newcomer, refused my card.
Then it dawned upon me with a certain suddeness that I was different from the others ... shut out from their world by a vast veil.

I had ... no desire to tear down that veil ... I held all beyond it in common contempt and lived above it in a region of blue sky and great wandering shadows.

I would never decide (how to wrest the prizes from them): whether by reading law, healing the sick, telling the wonderful tales.

With other black boys the strife was no so fiercely sunny: their youth shrunk into tasteless sycophancy, or into silent hatred of the pale world about them and mocking distrust of everything white or wasted itself in a bitter cry.

The Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil and gifted with second sight ... a world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world.

It's a peculiar sensation, this double consciousness ... one ever feels his twoness.

The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife ... to merge his double self into a better and truer self. In this merging he wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He would not Africanize America - America has too much to teach the world, and he would not bleach his Negro soul for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world.

He simply wishes to make it a possibility for man to both a Negro and an American ... without being cursed and spit upon.

This ... is the end of his striving: to be a co-worker in the kingdom of culture, to escape both death and isolation and use his best powers and latent genius.

The powers of body and mind in the past have been strangely wasted, dispersed or forgotten.

The black man's turning hither and thither in hesitant and doubtful striving has often made his very strength to lose effectiveness - it is not weakness, it is the contradiction of double aims. The double-aimed struggle of the black artisan ... on the one hand to escape white contempt for a nation ... on the other hand to escape white contempt for a nation of mere hewers of wood and water ... on the other hand to plough and nail and dig for a pvoerty stricken horde ... could only result in making him a poor craftsman.

By poverty and ignorance of his people the negro minister or doctor was tempted towards quackery and demagogy and by criticism of his lowly tasks, towards ideals that make him ashamed.

The would-be black savant was confronted by the paradox that the knowledge his people needed was a twice-told tale to his white neighbours.

This innate love of harmony and beauty that set the ruder souls of his people a-dancing and a-singing raised but confusion and doubt in the soul of the black artist; for the beauty revealed to him was the soul-0beauty of a race which his larger audience despised.

To the Negro, slavery was indeed the sum of all villainies, the cause of all sorrow, the root of all prejudice; Emancipation was the key to a promised land...

The first decade was merely a prolongation of the vain search for freedom, the boon that seemed ever barely to elude their grasp.

As the time flew, however, he began to grasp a new ideas. The ideal of liberty demanded for its attainment powerful means, and these the Fifteenth Amendment gave him.

The ballot ... the means of gaining and perfecting liberty.

Slowly but steadily, in the following years, a new vision began gradually to replace the dream of political power ... the ideal of 'book-learning'; the curiosity, born of compulsory ignorance, to know and test the power of the cabalistic letters of the white man.

The journey at least gave him leisure for reflection and self-realization, self-respect.

He began to have a dim feeling that, to attain his place in the world, he must be himself, and not another.

For the first time he sought to analyze the burden he bore upon his back, that dead-weight of social degradation partially masked behind a half-named Negro problem.

To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardship - the weight of his ignorance, of life, of business, of the humanities.

Men call the shadow prejudice and learnedly explain it as the natural defence of culture against barbarism, learning against ignorance, purity against crime, the 'higher' against the 'lower races.' To which the Nego cries Amen! ... this strange prejudice as is founded on just homage to civilization, culture, righteousness, and progress, he humbly bows and meekly does obeisance.

But before that nameless prejudice ... he stands helpless, dismayed and speechless ... there rises a sickening despair that would disarm and discourage any nation save that black host to whom 'discouragement' is an unwritten word.

The facing of so vast a prejudice could not but bring the inevitable self-questioning, self-disparagement and lowering of ideals which ever accompany repression and breed in an atmosphere of contempt and hate.

So dawned the time of Sturm und Drang: storm and stress, the bright ideals of the past - physical freedom, political power - ... have waxed and waned. Each alone was incomplete. To be really true, all these ideals must be melted into one. The power of the ballot we need in sheer second defence. The freedom to think, love, aspire and so o.

The darker ones come even now not empty-handed, there are no truer exponents of the pure human spirit of the Declaration of Independence than the American Negroes.

Merely a concrete test of the underlying principles of the great republic is the Negro problem.
