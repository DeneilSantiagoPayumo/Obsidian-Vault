# Borrowed identities: Class(ification), inequality and the role of credit-debt in class making and struggle.
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Class analysis has re-emerged as a pertinent area of enquiry. This development is linked to a growing body of work dubbed cultural class analysis, that utilises Bourdieu’s class scheme to develop rich understandings of how culture and lifestyle interacts with economic and social relations in Britain, generating inequalities and hierarchies. Yet cultural class analyses do not properly account for the way individuals resist their relative class positions, nor the role of unsecured credit in facilitating consumption. This article contributes to this area by examining how unsecured credit and problem debt influences consumption and class position amongst individuals with modest incomes. Drawing on 21 interviews with individuals managing problem debt, this article details how class inequality emerges through affective states that include anxiety and feelings of deficit. It also shows how these experiences motivate participants to rely on unsecured credit to consume cultural goods and engage in activities in a struggle against their class position, with the intention of enhancing how they are perceived and classified by others. The findings indicate that cultural class analyses may have overlooked the symbolic importance of mundane consumption and goods in social differentiation. This article further details how these processes entangle individuals into complex liens of debt – which lead to over-indebtedness, default, dispossession and financial expropriation – illustrating how investigations of credit-debt can better inform understandings of class inequality, exploitation and struggle.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

This article contributes to these debates by exploring inequality as a domain of experience. They champion a relational mode of analysis, but expand on this framework by addressing how unsecured credit influences consumption and class positions.

These experiences motivate participants to rely on unsecured credit to consume cultural goods and engage in activities in a struggle against their class position, with the intention of enhancing how they are perceived and classified by others.

Cultural class analyses in the past may have overlooked the symbolic importance of mundane consumption and goods, and this article aims to explore narratives beyond poverty - separate modalities of debt and insights into the high proportion of unsecured debt held by those outside lower income groups.

### How is the article organised?

The first section explores emergent paradigms in British class analysis, summarising their rich accounts of cultural consumption.

The second details how these might benefit from an appreciation of credit-debt and class struggle.

The third section outlines the study methods used and data collection process. 

The fourth section marks this article’s empirical contribution by tracing the links between perceived inequalities and credit use amongst the participants. 

The fifth section discusses the links between inequality, credit and financial expropriation by credit issuers, after which a conclusion is presented.

## Methods and Data Sources
### How was this data collected?

The debt charity StepChange was approached - a free-to-customer provider of specialist problem advice and solutions in the UK. In-depth face-to-face interviews were carried out.

9 women, 12 men ranging between 30 and 72 years, and a mean of 50.2

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Emergent paradigms in British class

This briefly underlines the trajectory of thinking about class:

1. [[Pierre Bourdieu]] - notion of capital encourages thinking about consumption.
2. [[Mike Savage]] - CCSE that regards inequalities as cumulative, caused by different kinds of capital accumulation in which advantaged classes secure their advantages.
3. [[Bennett et al]] explore embodied cultural capital and finds through bodily practices of eating and clothing, individuals access 
4. [[Mike Savage]] et al touch on this, detailing how those with higher volumes of capital sometimes viewed the cultural practices they regarded as inferior as indicative of pathological identities
5. Others discussed how homes, bodies and clothes of the working class are made to seem some greater pathology of disgust - [[Skeggs]] [[Imogen Tyler]] whereas those who have accumulated high volumes of economic capital are assumed to have done so meritocratically.

**Class struggle, reflexivity and the role of credit in consumption**

It overlooks a body of research showing how people struggle against, deflect and resist practices of othering. The focus on measuring differences in cultural consumption has obscured the role of financial resources.

Bourdieu recognises that all groups aspire to possess that which the group ahead already has, and that it's not surprising why credit is so important. Credit is a resource that can be used by individuals to imitate the consumption of other classes in order to subvert schemes of classification.

The proliferation of credit has made it possible for many people to simulate the consumption of a class despite not belonging to or maintaining it.

### 'Balancing out' living standards: Credit and its use in overcoming feelings of deficit.

[[Mike Savage]] notes that class positions are closely tied up with personal relationships and divorce can act as a catalyst for downward mobility and anxiety about one's place in the world. (1424)

Credit can be used to mitigate feelings of deficit and downward mobility triggered by relationship breakdown. (1424)

'Balancing out' of living standards is also apparent in some participants' social interactions when eating out with friends and families ... eating out forms an activity that can signal someone's economic and cultural capital. Consequently, an inability to eat out or eat at a specific type of restaurant can play into an individual's self-perception.' (1425)

### "I'm better than him': Credit and struggles with schemes of classification

"Many participants articulate perceptions of schemes of classification linked to consumption, whereby homes, cars, clothes, holiday resorts, goods and possessions are used to place an individual's class position." (1425)

We can see similar processes in participants' acquisition of cars. According to Stokes and Hallet, cars are perceived as a mobile 'status symbol' because of their 'ability to place people on a number of scales of social positioning.' (1427).

The key here is how this altered positioning reconstructed his sense of self and self-worth in a positive way. (1428)

### "Discussion: Borrowed identities and changing class positioning

[[Bennett et al]]  assertation that consumption patterns "contribute to the marking of social position and schemes of social classification" (1428) The data further reveal how unsecured credit can be utilised to consume goods, accumulate possessions and engage in activities to influence social positions.

These processes can enhance an individual's stores of capital: (p, 1429)
1. First, as participants indicate, credit emancipates individuals individuals from fixed income and fixed patterns of consumption ... making it possible to maintain consumption of a class from which they do not wish to fall
2. Second, these credit practices can signal 'privileges and advantages in users' 'social life'... which would not be possible if it were inaccessible. As Bourdieu puts it, conspicous forms of consumption are often an 'excellent investment in social capital'
3. Third, because these practices can inculcate styles of life that alter self-perceptions and dispositions, this suggests that credit-debt is a transformative force.

The capital-based approach to class - as the crystallisation of inequalities and accumulation of advantages.

There can be some consequences:
Serious consequences of the promotion and use of credit for the practices specified here, as high personal debt levels can increase risk of default - citing relationship breakdown, poor health, redundancy and reduced incomes as factors triggering default.

Participants' experiences are characterised by multiple form of 'financial expropriation' by financial institution, highlighting how the economic advantages of those working in the financial sector are partly incumbent on the dispossession and extraction of value from other individuals.
