# Review Essay: Foucault's *Discipline and Punish* An Exposition and Critique
David Garland, 1986
1975

[[Michel Foucault]]
[[States and Social Control]]

Prison as area where modern techniques of control are revealed:
Approach to imprisonment that conceives it as social control
Relegates penal institutions to strategies of control and classification.

"It offers a history which is similarly limited-relating penal institutions to strategies of control and classification but neglecting to show how these institutions have been shaped by changing forms of mentality, sensibility, and culture; giving prominence to the structures of power and knowledge but little attention to the agents and events that produced." (849)

## Fundamental concepts: Power, Knowledge, the Body

**Body**: the idea that the human body is the ultimate material that is seized and shaped by political, economic and penal institutions: the successful subjugation of bodies. Sometimes through force, sometimes through the soul.

"This self-controlled" body is brought about by exerting an influence on what Foucault calls "the soul"' which in turn directs behavior. In this sense, strategies of power have their real, operative impact at the point where they come in contact with the bodies of their subjects: there is "a micro-physics of power" where power has its bodily materiality and effects." (852)

**Power**: various forms of domination that operate wherever social relations exist, not as property. Social life takes place across a multiplicity of fields of forces that are sometimes connected. How are they organized and what forms do they take? "Power is a pervasive aspect of social life ... Thought of as productive in effect rather than repressive and as acting "through" individuals rather than "against" them." (853)

**Knowledge**: control depends on an understanding of its forces, possibilities. The more is known, the more controllable it becomes.


**Discipline** as "an art of the human body", conceived of as an object and target of power that can be controlled.

Organizational principles - army that did most to develop the art of distributing individuals in space, monastery (set rhythms, repetition).

**Normalizing deviance** - corrective, concerned to induce conformity. "It involves assessing the individual in relation to a desired standard of conduct: a means of knowing how the individual performs, watching his movements, assessing his behaviour, and measuring it against the rule. Surveillance arrangements and examination procedures provide this knowledge, allowing incidents of nonconformity or departures from set standards to be recognized and dealt with. And since the object is to correct rather than punish, the actual sanctions used tend to involve exercises that in themselves help bring conduct "into line"." (859)

**Panopticon** - an architectural form that renders individuals subject to the knowledge and power of central authorities, constant visibility and vulnerability induces self-control.

**Discipline and democracy**: generalization of discipline that made possible the generalization of democratic constitutions and expansion of liberal forms of freedom.

**Discovery of "the criminal" and "criminology**: information about the criminal not previous available, individualize the offender and determine the relationship. This creates the criminal.

"It "made" delinquents in a literal sense by creating the conditions for recidivism: offenders were so stigmatized, demoralized, and de-skilled in prison that after their release they tended to re-offend ... Second, the prison produced the delinquent in a categorical sense ... By creating in the course of the practice, the category of "the individual criminal"." 

There is a carceral continuum that persists throughout the world. Penal law is a hybrid system combining principles of legality with principles of normalization.

"Within this overall framework, the process of punishing is not essentially different from that of educating or curing ... Legal punishments come to be regarded as more legitimate and less in need of justification ... The legal restriction and limitations that once surrounded the power to punish - tying it to specific crimes, determining its duration, guaranteeing the rights of those accused, etc. - tend to disappear. Penal law in effect becomes a hybrid system combining the principles of legality with the principles of normalization." (865)

Power relations productive and not repressive?

Punishment as a "power-knowledge" mechanism. Institutions of punishment play an important role within wider social and political strategies - power operates and is literally materialized.

## Critique

### Historical Perspective

Historical perspective fails to supply evidence.
Creation of a criminal class as a political strategy? No evidence.
Argument only makes sense in France 1840s and 1850s, not the late 20th century."
What is the carceral era? No evidence to show that these methods have displaced other non-disciplinary sanctions.

### Sociological perspective

Punishment is a form of power itself. However:
"The force of this theoretical preconception is such that Foucault refuses to accept that there are elements of the penal system which malfunction and so are not effective as forms of control or else are simply not designed to function as control measures in the first place." (873)

What was penal policy shaped by? Justice, economy, vengeance, forgiveness, charity, evangelism - punishment becomes different from control.

"These punitive aspects [of penal systems] are often seen as reinforcing the control elements of the system, but there is psychological and penological evidence to show that punitiveness is actually a very inefficient and temporary form of control. It may even be that part of the reason why our penal institutions are poor at exerting control and modifying the conduct of offenders is precisely because they are punitive in form." (874)

Better explanations:
-  [[Emile Durkheim]] in satisfying a desire to inflict punishment upon lawbreakers and have them dismissed.
- Penal system needs a sanction that can incapacitate the recalcitrant and take dangerous individuals out of circulation
- Investment too costly to get rid of.

Demand criss-cross. There are values other than power and control that has consequences.

How do social values exist and are transformed?

Norms of conformity, obedience and behaviour control - why not literacy, cleanliness, health, responsibility, independence?

Discipline is necessary for self-control, but forms the basis for a regulatory network through the norms of health, security and welfare. Avoids such questions.

**Not part of the article**

Other criticisms: why is it important to resist power and domination? Who is dominating or subjugating whom? Who is resisting to whom? Power can be possessed but Foucault does not provide a framework for resistance. Foucault writes from the perspective of the colonizer. 


### [[Judith Butler]] [[Gender Trouble, Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]
"Butler examines how the theoretic division between a socially constructed gender and a presumed biological sex, ultimately constitutes the illusion that the subject’s gender is grounded in a fixed and binary biological essence, that can be found in its pure form, unhampered by patriarchy, deep in the female psyche or in the distant past. According to Butler this belief is sustained by psychoanalysts, but also by feminists, who discursively constitute ‘women’ as the subject of their feminism. She finds this emancipatory tactic exclusionary and self-defeating, as it would uphold the heterosexual matrix, in which femininity and masculinity serve as the mere extensions of ‘male’ and ‘female’, and in which other identities cannot endure. According to Butler, gender should not be seen as a biological fact or internal state of ‘being’, but rather as an enacted performance and active way of ‘doing’ that makes us believe that it exists. Butler claims that ‘the various acts of gender create the idea of gender, and without those acts, there would be no gender at all’. This leads her to the radical conclusion that ‘there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is performatively constituted by the very “expressions” that are said to be its results’." (QueerEurope)

"By redefining gender from a passive and natural ‘state of being’, to an active and performative ‘way of doing’, Butler adds an important insight to Foucault’s genealogy of modern power. She upholds Foucault’s position that modern power is productive, while simultaneously transcending the idea that bodies are merely docile victims of the modern powers by which they are produced. And although Butler acknowledges that gender is always performed within a limiting and ‘highly rigid regulatory frame’, she clearly indicates that there are possibilities to destabilize and resist this order. Butler notes that subversive gender performances, such as cross-dressing, travesty, drag and parody, can be used to undermine the essentialist belief that there is a ‘true gender identity’, and she furthermore suggests that labels such as ‘queen’, ‘butch’, ‘dyke’ and ‘queer’ can be discursively reappropriated, to destabilize the heterosexual matrix. Hereby, Butler offers concrete tools for agency and resistance, and although she oversteps Fraser’s demand for a clear normative framework, she delivers something even more radical – an anti-normative framework and continuous call for subversive action."
