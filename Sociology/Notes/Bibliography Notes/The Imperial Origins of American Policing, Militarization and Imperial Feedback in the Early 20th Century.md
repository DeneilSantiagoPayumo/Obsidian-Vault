# The Imperial Origins of American Policing: Militarization and Imperial Feedback in the Early 20th Century 
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
In the early 20th century, police departments across America’s cities enhanced their infrastructural power by adopting various tactical, operational, and organizational innovations. Based upon a nested cross-city analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, including a negative binomial regression analysis of the determinants of militarization, thisstudy reveals that these innovations constituted an early form of militarization resulting from imperial feedback. Local police borrowed tactics, techniques, and organizational templates from America’s imperial-military regime that had been developed to conquer and rule foreign populations. Imperial feedback occurred as a result of imperial importers, many of them veterans of America’s imperial-military apparatus, who constructed analogies between colonial subjects abroad and ra-cialized minorities at home. The study identifies an early form of police militarization, reveals the imperial origins of police militarization,and offers a potentially transportable theory of imperial feedback thatstands as one among other possible routes to police militarization.

### How is the article organised?


### What are the key takeaways?

I propose one answer through a study of transformation of local civilian policing in early 20th-century America.

Local civilian police departments in the United States had been established in the mid-19th century, modelled after the London Metro Police of 1829, but these early police departments were powerless and corrupt.

Then - the reform era. This is when city police departments reorganized, shifted focus and increased their capacities through a range of new organizational forms, increasing their power capabilities.

- First, the reform era marked one of the earliest instancesof police militarization. Crucial changes instituted by police reformers in this period were in fact borrowed from the military, in effect transforming local civilian institutions into more militaristic ones.

- Second, in making the changes, police reformers did not just draw from the “military” per se but also more precisely from America’s imperial-military regime. Many of the innovations did not only have military origins but rather imperial and colonial origins, thereby constituting a case of imperial feedback.

- Finally, this feedback and hence militarization occurred through the work of imperial importers who were most often but not exclusively military veterans and who typically deployed overseas methods in order to manage perceived threats to social order from racialized minority populations.

In short, I find that local civilian policing militarized in the early 20th-century United States due to feedback from imperialism abroad conjoined with racial analogization at home.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### AN "ARMY FOR EMPIRE"

"In sum, the exigencies of empire at the turn of the 20th century **led to the formation of a new imperial-military regime better oriented toward the needs of colonial conquest and counterinsurgency**. This was an “army for empire” that because of its imperial experience was significantly different from the military that had fought in the Civil War (Cosmas 1998; Birtle 2009). And it was through these experiences that it innovated on multiple fronts, eventually becoming the globally oriented, highly capable, and modern force that later entered World War I (United States Marine Corps [1940]1990, p. 2; Kaplan 2001). **In many ways, this “military” was synonymous with empire.** This is why, in this period, the military must be thought of as part of an imperial-military regime, rather than just a “military” in itself."

(Innovations include military intelligence to survey non-whites, "open order" operations of small units.)

(Changes include professionalisation, military operations and tactics, organizational levels).

### FROM EMPIRE TO POLICING

#### The Organizational and the Cultural: Centralization and professionalization (1203-1206)

This point was to make police chiefs more autonomous, shield them from corruption and create chains of command and distinct jurisdiction that would enhance power capabilities.

"While police reformers turned to the new imperial-military regime for models of centralization, they also turned to it as they aimed to discipline and train their forces, thereby “professionalizing” them. They pushed for in-creased pay, higher standards and criteria for employment, and heightened discipline. They instituted new testing procedures and training programs, setting up, for instance, police academies and schools."

#### Operations and Tactics: Counterinsurgency

"Police reformers imported tactical and operational innovations - increasing their surveillance powers using the Bertillon system of criminal identification, fingerprinting and intelligence units using novel data-collection and records systems..." (1206)

A man named Vollmer did a majority of these innovations - "pin mapping" which marked places where crimes had occurred to track criminal's movements, predict future criminal activity, and better distribute his new mounted police unit ... Imported this technique from the Philippines too. (1209)


### EXPLAINING IMPERIAL FEEDBACK

#### Theoretical Overview

"Qualitative and quantitative analyses below reveal an entirely different factor at work: field homologies. Similarities between, on the one hand the peripheral-colonial field (the colonial or imperial space abroad where the new methods were initially invented and used) and, on the other, the domestic or metropolitan field (the site within the imperial metropole for which the methods are imported). On the one hand, peripheral fields like colonial societies share underlying characteristics. They are racially hierarchical, with colonizers (settlers, officials, soldiers, merchants, etc.) monopolizing power and privileges. And they are legitimated by racial ideologies constructing the colonized as “uncivilized,” incapable of self-government, "irrational," "childlike," and "degenerate" ... In this context, colonizer perceive the native population to be prone to criminality and disorder, and thus a persistent social and moral menace , or inherently violent and verging upon revolution ... This is why colonialism has often generated novel modes of coercion and other methods of social control: precisely to manage these perceived or real threats." (1211-1212)

Why?

Well:
1. "First, when domestic fields are more homologous with the structure of peripheral fields, the methods developed in the latter are most likely be transferred to the former." (1212)
2. "Second, imperial importers will most likely be veterans because they have the most direct knowledge of colonial methods. But imperial importers might also be nonveterans. Many imperial-military operations, forms, technologies, and techniques are modular: they can be picked up and used by others across different contexts. Nonveterans might learn about them from media, colleagues, or extended networks such as professional organizations." (1212)

#### Preliminary Analysis

The plausibility of this theory for explaining militarization: (1213)
1. First, regarding veterans - August Vollmer was not the only veteran of the imperial-military apparatus.
2. Second, it is clear that some cities were becoming more homologous with peripheral fields in this period and that police chiefs generally sought out new policing methods to manage.

Racial analogization followed from these field homologies - they were threats, job stealers, innate criminals, drugs, prostitutions and more. Programs were made to 'uplift' and 'civilize' the states, or attempts were made to regulate vices like opium and alcohol.

"In these police reformers' view, racial minorities required a strong police response just as the colonial state had to suppress colonized population abroad." (1215)

### QUALITATIVE CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS

Berkeley is selected because it was seen as a leader in militarization.

#### Veterans and Field Homologies in Berkeley, Philadelphia, and Savannah.

"Imperial feedback also occurred in Savannah. First, a veteran served as police chief. William G. Austin had been in the 7th Calvary Regiment of thearmy, fought in the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890, and been mobilizedfor the Spanish-American War before becoming chief in 1907. Second, Savannah was structurally homologous with peripheral fields: nonwhite res-idents in Savannah made up almost half of the population in 1900 and be-came the majority by 1910 due to migration, as African-Americans came to the city from the rural districts of the state. Austin became police chief during this new migration, and he responded by militarizing the department. He put the department “on a military basis” and instituted new measures to “discipline” his force (Report of the [Mayor of Savannah, GA][RMS1907], p. 53; Savannah Morning News [SMN], January 31, 1907, p. 16). He restructured the promotion and pay structure according to that which“ prevails in the United States army” (RMS1907, p. 53). He also adopted counterinsurgency techniques from the army, reorganizing the mounted and foot patrols by creating a new mounted force modelled after military units. The new mounted force, consisting of a “body of well drilled men,” would survey vast swaths of unknown territory, such as the “outlying areas of the city,” and, “in case of an emergency...be quickly assembled and moved rapidly from point to point”(RMS1908, p. 42;SMN, January 23, 1907, p. 12).

### QUANTITATIVE DATA AND MOUNTED POLICE

The evidence amassed above shows that (1) the militarization of ostensibly civilian police in the United States extends back to the early 20th century (thus further back than dominant historiography and popular discussionsof policing portray), (2) many of the militarized methods by which police were reorganized originated in America’s imperial-military regime, and (3) these militarized methods were initially introduced at home through imperial im-porters (military veterans or not) who classified urban changes in terms ofracialized threats homologous with colonial threats overseas. The significance, possible limits, and scope of the analysis warrant further discussion.

Existing Scholarship and Significance

```ad-quote
title: 1238
Imperial feedback is notonly the product of imperialism producing veterans who apply skills at homebut rather of a conjuncture between imperialism on the one hand and domestic racial dynamics on the other. Imperialism might have made new methods available, but whether or not they werefirst adopted and institutionalized by local police forces also had to do with domestic factors, in thiscase, shifting urban race relations brought on by new demographic shifts and internal migration that rendered domestic sites more analogous withcolonial sites.

The military was properly anim-perial military, and its specific operations and strategies were aimed not atgeneral warfare but more specifically at counterinsurgency and the mainte-nance of order in colonies, that is, at racialized subject populations. Further-more, many of the changes of the Root reform period within the military structure, even if they did not have to do directly with counterinsurgency, were prompted by America’s imperial ventures. The need to professionalize and centralize,forinstance,becameallthe more evident to officials and states-men only because of the imperial experience and the new imperial needs. Thisis why, as historians note, some of those reforms had been suggested decades earlier but were not implemented. They were only implemented in responseto imperial imperatives (Cosmas 1998, pp. 4–15; Clark 2017, pp. 188–96)

The second reason for why empire must be taken into account when theorizing police militarization in the early 20th century is that empire helps account for the timing of militarization. If empire was irrelevant—or forthat matter, if militarization was inevitable without empire—then the po-lice in Berkeley, Savannah, Philadelphia, and many other cities should have militarized much earlier than the first decade of the 20th century. It should have militarized, for instance, immediately after the Civil War. Yet the ev-idence in this article shows that police only militarized under specific historical conditions, that is,after military methods had become available through the imperial experience (and then, more specifically, in those cities where imperial importers facedfields homologous to peripheral fields). Therefore, empire along with domestic racial dynamics — helps explain why police militarization emerged in the early 20th century. By the same token, it helps explain the temporal variation across cities in the adoption of militaristic methods.

An altogether different interpretation is that empire is not important for understanding police innovations in the early 20th century because local police would have adopted militarized methods anyway, regardless of imperialism. Evidence for this alternative argument lies in the fact that, once the militarized reforms were adopted by innovator cities like Berkeley, they became available for all other departments who did eventually adopt them.This alternative interpretation would thus see the reform movement andBut this alternative interpretation would be incomplete. As with any functionalist argument, it fails to specify the mechanisms or processes by which putatively functional needs were met. Put differently, functional imperatives can be met in various different ways—through a variety of possible “functional substitutes” —and hence there were likely different routes or paths topolice militarization. In the early 20th century, it could have happened with-out empire. In some cities it did: once the innovating cities like Berkeley adopted the militarized forms and techniques, they were made available for other cities to adopt them later, in the second phase of the reform period. And those cities might have adopted them for other reasons besides havingveterans as chiefs orfield homologies. They could have adopted them dueto status competition or other mechanisms of emulation specified in theoriesof diffusion, for instance (Dimaggio and Powell 1983).The evidence in the present analysis shows that the crucial origin did infact have to with empire. It was empire that made new methods, operations, and techniques available to be adopted by police in thefirst place. Therefore, even if we believe that police militarization was a necessary and inevitable outcome, understanding the role of the imperial-military regime in police re-form allows us tofill in the black box between functional imperatives and out-comes, that is, to pinpoint the initial pathway toward militarized policing. Only by analyzing imperial feedback, therefore, can we answer the question with which we began: how and why has the civilian police become militarized historically? Even if it appears inevitable today, how exactly did it hap-pen and through what processes? Much in the same way that, according to Weber, the Protestant ethic helps explain the origins of capitalism but notits spread around the world, empire helps explain the origins of the early 20th-century round of police militarization even if it does not explain policemilitarization later.
