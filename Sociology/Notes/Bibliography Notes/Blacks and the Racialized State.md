Blacks typically support more government guarantees of rights and increased spending than whites. Other data shows that in general African Americans differed from whites in their support for a central state. For them, markets were unreliable because property rights could be ignored by powerful whites who could confiscate black property - local and state governments were historically even more racist than national government. Even with all of its failures, the national government has been seen as the arena of last resort for blacks.

While blacks supported a strong national government, they were not blind to the fact that many individuals exercising state power were white supremacists.

## History

The U.S government is considered to be one of the weakest central government in the West due to the division of powers making it difficult than in European parliamentary systems where the executive and legislative branches tend to be controlled by one party with a mandate.

[[Richard Bensel]] wrote in *Yankee Leviathan* that the strengthening of the American state occurred with the advent of the Civil War - both the Confederate States of American and the Union responded to the needs of war making by strengthening the central state apparatus of their respective polities.

Reconstruction of the South was the greatest attempt to build up the government in western history up to that time - they tried to remake the southern economy into one that was subservient to the North and an economy that was modernized.

Reconstruction radicals, black and white, were able to implement programs that greatly expanded health care, aid to the poor, debt relief, and public education in states throughout the South.  In the two decades that followed, growing labour unrest in the North and farmer organizing among both whites and blacks challenged planter rule in several southern states. The response of the south was to wave the bloody flag and launch a campaign that had the goals of ending the political threat from radicalized blacks, prevent any more interracial political coalition of the dispossessed and winning widespread northern support to the race problem.

To do this, they must make a claim that would make any argument for black equality stupid - at best blacks were children and at worst they were brutal savages. 

*Birth of a Nation* - political demonization is part of an American tradition of counter subversion. One of the consequences of this film some argued is that Blacks became a sign of the negative American identity - this new nation (forged in the last 15-20 years) was based on a re-subjugation of African Americans and the political defeat of their white supporters.

This film and book was made to "create feelings of abhorrence in white people".

State support for the film was indispensable in overcoming the denunciation of the film from black intellectuals but also in overcoming the opposition of elite white liberals who saw the film as a vilification of African Americans. Even the president at the time, Woodrow Wilson believed that the film was completely true.

Dixon (the author) won an endorsement from Klan member and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

So thus we have the key elements of racial demonization that persist to this day:
1. The exclusion of African Americans from the polity and the defeat of black power
2. The defining of what it means to be a good American as the opposite of being black
3. A view that whites have been wronged by blacks and the country has returned to its natural favoured states
4. The division of African Americans into 'good' and 'bad' Negroes
5. A strong gendered sexual content to the invoked stereotypes.
6. The use of the mass media to reinforce a message of scientific credibiltiy
7. The process of being endorsed at the highest level of the state
8. The claim that this is what is best for blacks.

The result was that southern separatism remained a strong force in American politics and class alliances were left skewed and weak as interregional rivalries dominated American politics. Southern separatism resisted the development either of a social welfare state and policies that would lead to further national integration and a nationwide class system.

Racism prevented the U.S from having a comprehensive social security system - several mechanisms were used such as selective implementation. The New Deal was contradictory - its relief programs provided aid on a discriminatory basis to urban blacks, yet key insurance, housing, and agricultural programs by a combination of outright exclusion and selective implementation severely limits African Americans' ability to participate as full citizens - also, a bifurcated welfare systems.

[[Skocpol]] describes multiple bifurcations of social policy:
1. The separation of welfare policy from fiscal policy. In Europe, fiscal policy was coordinated with welfare programs to ensure that unemployment stayed low but as the new deal became popular ... presenting a problem for blacks since official black unemployment rate as it has been over 10 percent following 1960s, a consequence being limited economic gains
2. Between means-tested and insurance-type programs: insurance programs were universal in scope. Means-tested created a racial boundary.
3. Boundaries that were inscribed in the social programs of the New Deal mark the third bifurcation of racial separation - programs that were perceived by whites as 'universal' were labelled as insurance programs that had 'worthy' beneficiaries whereas the means-tested programs that did have a significant minority clientele were viewed as having a recipient pool that was 'undeserving' were labelled as 'welfare' programs. 

The New Deal had built into them racial exclusions that barred African Americans from receiving full social benefits. They also faced disability due to New Deal programs and implementations: the Agricultural Adjustment Administration encouraged the throwing off of sharecroppers as land-owning planters made more by not farming the land, disadvantaging blacks who were overwhelmingly vulnerable sharecroppers.

This policy combined with mechanization pushed off land that contributed to the migration of blacks out of the South.

The problems that blacks had with new Deal policies were caused by their lack of political power - only representing 2 percent of the new Democratic coalition (Walter Dean Burnham). This would change with the migration to the cities of North and slow enfranchisement of southern blacks. This lack of power would set in place the structures that would deepen black disadvantage and limit African American ability to live as full citizens.

## New Deal Housing Policy

The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) was the first of major New Deal housing programs aimed at the urban workers who were critical to the Democratic party's electoral coalition. A similar program, the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act was aimed at the other critical part of the Democratic coalition.

It helped change lending practices by allowing the loans to be fully amortized.

It also introduced some practices that led to decay in the cities and institutionalized segregation. It introduced the policy of redlining. It was a system that divided metropolitan areas to zones - (best zones that are green (A), blue that are desirable (B), yellow that are declining (C) and red that are hazardous (D))

The criteria was racist - to be an A zone neighbourhood, the neighbourhood had to be homogeneous and American. Any neighbourhood that had an 'infiltration' of Jews could not be either. All black neighbourhoods then became D zones that were not eligible for HOLC because of their rating. This made it difficult for even affluent minorities to buy property and maintain neighbourhoods.

Restrictive financing had many bad effects: it was biased against urban architecture (such as row houses) and the racial, religious, and architectural preferences would combine to shift loans from building in the cities to the suburbs, encouraging the transfer of the white middle-class population of those cities to the suburbs whilst accelerating the decay of central cities.

Racial segregation was encouraged because the use of restrictive covenants in deeds prevented even the black middle class from leaving the cities for the most part.

## The Federal Housing Authority

The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) codified and extended the aforementioned practices on a massive scale. This enabled millions of Americans to buy their first homes, seen as a gigantic welfare program for the middle class. It reduced the size of needed down payments.

It also accelerated racial segregation and inner-city decay: it continued the practice of redlining: 60 percent of an evaluation was the economic stability of the neighbourhood from 'adverse' influences. Urban areas were disfavoured and multi-unit residences had less loans than single family ones. Black people were marked against.

Thus state policy has an enormous impact on racially shaping private markets. The credit maps produced by these practices had a self-fulfilling prophecy: neighbourhoods that were redlined were denied the resources necessary to maintain themselves regardless of the qualities of the residents.

It became clear that the housing needs of the poor needed to be addressed. Thus led to the Public Housing Program.
