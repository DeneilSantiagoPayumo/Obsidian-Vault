# Subjects of Sex / Gender / Desire

## Article Introduction

"In other words, the political construction of the subject proceeds with certain legitimating and exclusionary aims, and these political operations are effectively concealed and naturalized by a political analysis that takes juridical structures as their foundation." (5)

Feminism is constrained by the representational discourse in which it functions - there is not a seamless category of women, and these domains of exclusion reveals the coercive consequences. (7) The suggestion that feminism can seek wider representation for a subject that it itself constructs has the ironic consequence that feminist goals risk failure by refusing to take account of the constitutive powers of their own representational aims. (8)

To trace the operations that conceal what is a juridical subject of feminism is the task of a feminist genealogy of the category of women.

### The compulsory order of Sex / Gender / Desire

There is a split in Feminism by the distinction between sex and gender - whatever biological 'stuff' sex has, gender is culturally constructed.

There are problems: can we refer to a given sex or gender without inquiring into how it is given, and what *is* sex? Does sex have a history or histories? Is there a history of how the duality of sex was established? Are the binary options a construction? Are the natural facts of sex produced by scientific discourse in the service of social and political interests?

```ad-quote
"If the immutable character of sex is contested, perhaps this construct called "sex" is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all." (10)

"As a result, gender is not to culture as sex is to nature; gender is also the discursive / cultural means by which "sexed nature" or "a natural sex" is produced and established as "prediscursive," prior to culture, a politically neutral surface *on which* culture acts." (11)
```

Gender is this an apparatus of cultural construction that disguises sex.

### Gender and Identity

[[Simone de Beauvoir]] suggests that "one is not born, but, rather, becomes one" - gender is constructed, variable and volitional. One is under a cultural compulsion to become a woman and it does not come from sex. There is nothing in her account that guarantees that the "one" who becomes a woman is necessarily female - there is no recourse to a body that has not always been interpreted by cultural meanings; hence, sex could not qualify as a prediscursive anatomical facility. Indeed, sex, by definition, will be shown to have been gender all along. (12, paraphrased)

The body itself is a construction, as are the myriad bodies that constitute the domain of gendered bodies - bodies cannot be said to have a signifiable existence prior to the mark of their gender; the question emerges: to what extent does the body come into being in and through the marks of gender?

Feminist efforts to identify the enemy as a singular in form mimics the strategy of the oppressor instead of offering a differing term. The insistence upon the unity of the category of women has effectively refused the multiplicity of gender.


What can be meant by identity and what grounds the presumption that identities are self-identical? How do these assumptions inform the discourses on gender identity?

It would be wrong to think that a discussion of gender proceeds prior for the reason that "persons" become intelligible through becoming gendered in conformity with recognizable standards of gender intelligibility.

To what extent do regulatory practices of gender formation and division constitute identity, the internal coherence of the subject and the self-status?

The very notion of "the person" is called into question by the cultural emergence of those "incoherent" or "discontinuous" gendered being who appear to be persons but fail to conform to the gendered norms of cultural intelligibility by which persons are defined.

Intelligible genders are those which in some sense institute and maintain relations of coherence and continuity - themselves thinkable in relation to existing norms of continuity prohibited by laws that seek to establish expressive lines of connection among biological sex and culturally constituted genders.

```ad-quote
"The notion that there might be a "truth" of sex ... is produced precisely through the regulatory practices that generate coherent identities through the matrix of coherent gender norms. The hetero-sexualisation of desire requires and institutes the production of discrete and asymmetrical oppositions between "feminine" and "masculine," where these are understood as expressive attributes of "male" and "female". The cultural matrix through which gender identity has become intelligible requires that certain kinds of "identities" cannot exist" - that is, those in which gender does not follow from sex and those in which the practices of desire do not "follow" from either sex or gender." (23-24)
```

The institution of a naturalized heterosexuality requires and regulates gender as a binary relation in which the masculine term is differentiated from a feminine term, accomplished through the practices of heterosexual gender.

If it is possible to speak of a masculine man and understand that attribute as a happy but accidental feature of that man, it is also possible to speak of a feminine man but once we dispense with the priority of "man" and "woman" as abiding substances, it becomes impossible to subordinate gendered features as so many secondary and accidental characteristics of a gender ontology that is fundamentally intact. "If the notion of an abiding substance is a fictive construction produced through the compulsory ordering of attributes into coherent gender sequences, then it seems that gender as substance, the viability of *man* and *woman* as nouns, is called into question by the dissonant play of attributes that fail to conform to sequential or causal models of intelligibility." (32).

The appearance of a gendered self is produced by the regulation of attributes along culturally established lines, conditioned by the play of attributes that resist assimilation into the framework of nouns and adjectives.

title: The performance of gender
Hence, within the inherited discourse of the metaphysics of substance, gender proves to be performative - that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might said to preexist the deed." (33)
```

### Language, Power and the Strategies of Displacement

Sexuality that emerges within the matrix of power relations is not a replication of the law itself of a masculinist economy - the productions swerve from their original purposes and mobilize possibilities of subjects that expand the boundaries of what it culturally intelligible.

This utopian of a sexuality freed from heterosexual constructs fails to acknowledge the ways in which power relations construct sexuality for women in terms of a 'liberated' heterosexuality. The pro-sexuality movement argues that sexuality is constructed within terms of discourse and power, but the emergence of a sexuality constructed is not a sign of masculine identification.

The replication of heterosexual constructs in non-heterosexual frames brings into relief the utterly constructed status of the so-called heterosexual original.

# 2 Prohibition, Psychoanalysis and the Production of the Heterosexual Matrix

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The origins of patriarchy

Feminists believe that there is an 'origin' to patriarchy. It's important to restructure and define what this is. Some feminists take [[Claude Levi-Strauss]] 's anthropology to believe that there is a natural or biological female who is turned into the socially subordinate woman.

The concept of sex itself is a naturalized foundation for the nature/culture distinction and the strategies of domination that this distinction supports.

[[Marilyn Strathern]] and [[Carol MacCormack]] argue that nature/culture discourse regularly figures nature as female, in need of subordination by a culture that is figured as male, active and abstract. Critics of structuralism like [[Clifford Geertz]] argue that its framework discounts the cultural configurations of nature - what qualifies as nature, is dualism necessary?

If constructed gender is all there is, then there appears to be no "outside", no anchor for a "before".

```ad-seealso
title: Her work on Levi Strauss
collapse: closed
Structuralist discourse tends to refer to the law in the singular, in accordance with Levi-Strauss contention that there is a universal structure of regulating exchange that characterises all systems of kinship.

[[The elementary structures of kinship]] argues that the object of exchange that differentiates kinship relations is women - that the bride and gift opens a channel of exchange that serves a functional purpose of facilitating change and obtains the symbolic purpose of consolidating the internal bonds - the bride functions as a relational term between groups of men, she does not have an identity and reflects masculine identity.

The structural systematicity of his explanation appeals to a universal logic that appears to structure human relations. The questions here concern the place of assumptions in his universal logic and the relationship of that logic to the subordinate status of women within the cultural reality that this logic describes. If the symbolic nature of exchange is its human character, and if that universal structure distributes identity to male persons and a lack thereof to women, then this logic may be contested. To what extent do logical systems require an unnamed, excluded relation subsequently concealed by the logic itself?

The totality and closure of language is presumed and contested within structuralism. for Levi-Strauss, the cultural identity is established through an overt act of differentiation between patrilineal clans.

The incest taboo is the juridical law that is said to prohibit incestuous desires and to construct gendered subjectivities through compulsory identification. But what guarantees the necessity of those laws?

Her task is not to show cultures in which incest taboo does not operate, but instead underscore the generativity of that taboo. Not only does the taboo forbid sexuality in certain forms, but is produces a variety of substitute desire and identities that are not constrained in advance.

If we extend [[Michel Foucault]]'s critique then it may seem that the taboo and desire for mother/father can be historicized to resist the universality of Lacan - creating and sustaining the desire for mother/father as the compulsory displacement of that desire.

If the incest taboo regulates the production of discrete gender identities, production requires the prohibition, then homosexuality emerges as a desire that must be produced to be repressed - it requires an intelligible conception of homosexuality and prohibition of that conception in rendering it culturally unintelligible.

The bisexuality that is said to be outside the Symbolic and serves as a locus of subversion is a construction within the terms of that constitutive discourse, the construction of an outside that is not inside, not a possibility beyond culture but a concrete cultural possibility that is refused and redescribed as impossible. What remains unthinkable and unsayable is not what is excluded, it is the marginalized possibility that calls for dread or the loss of sanction.

The unthinkable is excluded from dominant culture.

... the rest is skipped unless I cover Levi Strauss, Freud or Lacan.
