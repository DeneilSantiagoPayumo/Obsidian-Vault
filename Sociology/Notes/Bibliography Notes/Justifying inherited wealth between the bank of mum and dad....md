# Justifying inherited wealth: Between 'the bank of mum and dad' and the meritocratic ideal
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
How do people reconcile belief in meritocracy with the receipt of unearned economic gifts? Drawing on interviews with first time homeowners who had bought property with familial gifts or inheritances, we find that many downplay the intergenerational privilege associated with gifting by reporting extended family histories of working-class struggle, upward social mobility and meritocratic striving. Interviewees also draw boundaries between their own wealth and the less legitimate wealth of others, or dispute the significance of gifting compared to other inequalities. We further argue that gifting is a site where two competing logics, the ‘domestic’ and family-orientated and the ‘civic’ and meritocratic, collide. While these competing principles appear to be in conflict, we detailhow many labour discursively to bring them into alignment. Here interviewees deploy a humble ‘intergenerational self’to recast familial gifts as evidence of multigenerational meritocratic success. Yet, while some successfully reconcile theseconflicting‘orders of worth’, for others the tension remains unresolved.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

The world's billionaires, only 2,153 people, have more wealth than 4.6 billion people (Oxfam, 2020). The paradox here is that such reliance on intergenerational support has grown at the same time that norms of meritocracy have become entrenched. ([[Mijis]], 2019; [[Mike Savage]], 2015). How do people reconcile belief in meritocratic achievement with accepting large and unearned economic gifts?

### How is the article organised?

We address this question by drawing on 27 interviews with homeowners in London who had recently bought property with financial help. Did they experience any tension with receiving financial gifts?

We draw on the sociology of critical capacities to foreground these explanations, and build on a body of sociological work exploring the negotiation of parental financial group.

Less attention in these literature has been paid on whether people understand parental financial gifts as drivers of inequality.

### What are the key takeaways?

There is widespread discomfort at receiving unearned gifts and interviewees employ distinctive strategies to justify their receipt or mitigate feelings of discomfort: interviewees deploy 'origin stories' that downplay their own upbringings and situate their subjectivity as rooted in working-class or upwardly mobile extended family histories.

This 'intergenerational self' attempts to reconcile these tensions between meritocracy and unearned gifts, deflecting suspicions of ascribed privilege and positioning gifted money as interviewees 'own'.

We find some efforts to downplay housing wealth as a site of wealth inequality, shifting the narrative to other forms: these strategies defuse tensions as they emerge in response to a perceived conflict between value systems - the domestic and the 'general will'


... the main way that respondents justified their own experience of inheritance / gifting was by drawing attention to a particular socialized subjectivity which we call the intergenerational self:

(623-624) for all below.

```ad-quote
"This intergenerational self, in which people understand their social identity not only in terms of their own life experiences, but also in terms of what they have heard about their parents' and grandparents' lives, provided a key means through which many respondents justified or attempted to resolve the tension between receiving unearned capital and adhering to the idea of meritocracy."
```

```ad-quote
A second way in which people justified their own receipt of an unearned financial gift was by contrasting their own economic experience with that of real or imagined others. Here we draw on [[Lamont]]’s (1992) notion of ‘boundary work’ and the various repertoires of evaluation people draw on to symbolically demarcate themselves from others. Specifically, we show how interviewees mobilized a complex combination of political and moral grounds to draw symbolic boundaries between their own inherited wealth and that of others. Crucial here were the narration of particular, meritocratically legitimate, wealth ‘origin stories’ that were then positioned against friends or peers (and sometimes public figures) who had benefited from wealth that was greater, had been acquired through illegitimate family ties, or through other means that were less clearly tied to hard work.

```ad-quote
Finally, some respondents mitigated the tension associated with the receipt of unearned income by resituating questions of wealth inequality and fairness away from housing. Here we found efforts, often quite subtle, to underplay housing wealth as a site of inequality, or of intergenerational gifts as aproblem, and instead to shift the narrative to other forms of inequality orunfairness that were claimed to be more problematic.

## Methods and Data Sources
### How was this data collected?

Consisted of 27 semi-structured interviews lasting between one and 1.5 hours with 21 individuals and three couples who bought their first property in London with financial support.

### What, if any are the pitfalls behind how the data was gathered? Does the author address this?

As intergenerational gifting can be sensitive, it can elicit feelings of guilt, embarrassment and shame. Inheritors are hard to find. The methods chosen were through snowball sampling through friends and interviewers which created a skew towards left-wing political attitudes. Since this diverges from overall attitudes, we employed a professional recruitment company to recruit 14 more interviewees.

Interviewees were asked about their family background, the process of negotiating financial transfers, feelings of receiving help and their opinion on policies concerning inheritance tax.

### Special notes on the method chosen.

A co-production and may be hard to replicate. However it allows respondents to 'reason out loud' about feelings hard to explore. 


## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Making sense of unearned wealth: The intergenerational self

```ad-quote
title: 626
"The 'need to explain' comes, we suggest, from a wide-spread awareness that although receiving money from parents is common, it is also at odds with dominant values of meritocracy."

```

```ad-quote
title: ibid
"Significantly, most interviewees negotiated this tension by deploying various kinds of explanation or justification. The overarching theme flanked such justifications was, following Fivush *et *al*. (2008), the idea of an intergenerational self. This had three distinct but interlinked elements: having 'humble origins' at some point in one's extended family history; a familial narrative marked by hard work and meritocratic achievement; and an internalized familial ethos of frugality and caution."

```

For them, this idea of a 'humble origin' explained how these origins were transformed into economic prosperity. Parental economic support for interviewees were then envisioned as legitimate. Thus, the hard work of previous generations means that a financial windfall in the present does not need to be understood as earned.

It also involved folding narratives of parental work into one's own subjectivity in the present.

```ad-quote
title: 628
"What all three elements of the intergenerational self - that is, 'humble origins', hard work/meritocracy, and an internalzied familial ethos of frugality and caution - had in common was that each served to justify or contextualize the money interviewees had received. On the one hand, the gifted money could be construed as in some way 'their money' ... through the extended sense of intergenerational subjectivity. On the other hand, the money itself could be seen as legitimate, becuase its origins and means of accrual could be demonstrated to lie in (often intergenerational) hard work over time."
```


### The limits of intergenerational self

The ability of the intergenerational self to resolve the respondents' subjectively felt tensions differed in important ways - for a small number of respondents, the intergenerational self appeared effective at eliminating tensions between receiving gifts and a belief in meritocracy. In these cases, it allowed interviewees to fold parental gifts into a story of upward mobility.

Below, paraphrased, 628-629
1. Parental occupation: in places where parents were more objectively working class, interviewees showed less tension.
2. Parental (or grandparental migration) which precipitated the need to 'start again'. For stories of PoC, families expressed legitimacy through an experience of restricted social mobility, exclusion from certain kinds of opportunities, and a sense of having to work 'harder' than white or 'native' peers with equivalent qualifications.
3. Interviewee's parents had divorced, leading to a childhood characterised by downward social mobility for the mother and low family income.

Despite that, there remained a residue of discomfort and conflict regarding these gifts - these interviewees struggled to bridge the gap between the objective privileges they have and the intergenerational story of humble origins they sought to tell.

### Boundaries between self and others

Interviewees justified the receipt of financial assistance in other ways.


```ad-quote
title: 631
One common strategy, often deployed alongside acknowledging awkwardness with some friends was to draw boundaries with *other* friends (or peer group members). The point of contrast here was often those who had benefited from greater wealth, capital that had been acquired through illegitimate family ties, or other means that were less clearly tied to ‘hard work’.
```

Other times, they drew boundaries between themselves and more wealthy or privileged partners. 

The drawing of boundaries between one's own property story and that of wealthier others came up when interviewees were asked to talk about 'the bigger picture' in terms of housing inequality. (p, 631)

When respondents were critical of inheritance tax, they made an attempt to make the logic of family ties and loyalty fit within a recent norm of meritocracy - grounding criticism in the idea that wealthier others would pay tax whereas ordinary families would not. (632)

They positioned their 'modest' gifts as reflecting natural expressions of familial loyalty, love and support as well as unique meritocratic legitimacy in terms of how the capital was accumulated. This reconciliation was aided by boundary-drawing with the aristocracy and super-wealthy. (632-633)

### Downplaying the significance of gifting to inequality

"The final way that interviewees justified financial gifts was to dispute housing wealth as a significant source of inequality. This was done in various ways. Almost all respondents started by acknowledging that inequality was a problem, but then went on to either deny that housing wealth was a central aspect of inequality, assert more powerful sources of inequality, or to discuss wider issues of housing inequality, but downplay the role of intergenerational transfers." (633)

Below, 633-634, paraphrased:
1. People were keen to diminish the significance of intergenerational gifting by contrasting it with a bigger picture of inequality - a denial that the transmission of wealth between generations and the logic of loyalty to kin that implies.
2. In different ways then respondents deployed their 'inequality knowledge' in a way that worked simultaneously blur the significance of gifting and foreground other 'inequality culprits' such as buy-to-let landlords, tax-avoiding global corporations or companies engaged in 'land banking.'
3. Far from being a source of inequality, financial gifts were recognised as a form of 'levelling up' for the less well off on it. Among these interviewees there was a genuine sense of unfairness at the idea that either financial gifts or inherited property may be taxed.


1. Our work contributes by showing the discomfort and moral compromises associated with the receipt of financial gifts that are linked to a wider social discomfort.
2. These social discomforts and tensions can be understood through [[Boltanaski and Thevenot]]'s notion of competing 'orders of worth' - evidence of people identifying conflicting principles at work in their own lives, and trying to justify adhering to one principle or another.
3. This work explains why people see inheritance tax as unfair - grounded in meritocracy, did not see themselves as qualifying for it.
