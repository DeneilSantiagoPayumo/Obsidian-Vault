### Interest Groups Defined

An interest group is a collective political actor that attempts to influence governmental policy decisions - typically formal organisations with a name and membership requirements, but sometimes lacking bounded membership.

A good example is the tea party (you studied this!) - an organization that aimed to further the environmental deregulatory interests of Koch Industries. We restrict our attention to voluntary associations without policy interests such as fraternal, philanthropic or recreational goals.

Government agencies act as interest organisations by participating in coalitions or directly pressuring other governmental units. The National Association of Mayors lobbies on federal policies affecting cities from transportation to police assistance.

Also, SMO - a formal group of activists trying to advance the interests of excluded or powerless people.

### Recent Research: context and structures
Here, context and structures, strategies and actions, influence on policy outcomes.

We've done a lot of studies into interest groups - number of interest groups, how it formed and so on. Interest groups responded 

We used population ecology theory, focusing on institutional context - the rate at which a new type of interest group forms affected by the density of this type within the entire interest-group population. The formation rate will be low when a new type of interest group is scarce as the new type must justify its activities and gain legitimacy. Eventually this new type stops growing because competition resulting from a denser population constrains available resources.

One effort is interest representation - the individual level bias is the tendency for people with higher socio-economic status to participate more than lower-status people in interest-group activities. Second, organizational-level bias occurs when most groups are organized around business and professional interests instead of citizen interests. Business groups have more resources and expertise enabling them to exercise greater policy influence.

Some studied interest-group coalitions using social network analysis: three types of political activities, endorsing the same candidates, donating to the same candidates, supporting the same legislative proposals. Interest groups were split into two coalitions polarized along party lines in primary and general elections but not in legislative debates.

### Strategies and Actions

We focus on their strategies.

Most interest groups deploy a wide range of lobbying tactics. In pluralist theories, most group gain access to policy-makers. Insider groups implement outsider strategies - strategic choice depends on both political context and interest-group characteristic. Groups with access to policy makers pursue more activities targeting those officials. Groups in competitive situations pursue indirect strategies when facing challenges of attracting members. 

Differing EU and US context resulted in diverging research.
Eising (2004) found that groups unable to influence domestic policies mobilized at the EU level.
Grossman argued against overestimating interest-group ability to mobilize at the highest level due to EU-level barriers.
Beyers and Kerremans suggested that choosing an advocacy level is shaped both by EU governance structural opportunities and group embeddedness in immediate context.
Mahoney and Baumartner proposed that future venue-shopping strategy research consider the political opportunity structures within which interst groups operate.

For US:
- Mahoney compared the advocacy strategies of US and European interest-group communities, showing that American and European interest-group communities deploy similar tactics in argumentation, inside lobbying and networking, differing on lobbying approaches, targeting strategies, outside lobbying, and coalition building. US lobbyists are more inclined to block policy proposals, target policy-makers, bring issues to the public whereas Europeans do partial goals. It shows the importance effects of institutional characteristics and issue contexts on group advocacy behaviour.


### Influence

In pluralist theories, interest groups play a key role as they represent popular interests and serve as intermediates between citizens and policy-makers. The legitimacy of pluralism depends on how much influence interest groups wield and how power is distributed among them.

They proposed an equilibrium model of political forces to explain interest-group emergence in democratic polities. People form groups and mobilize politically whenever their interests are threatened, opposing interests counterbalance and constrain one another's influence.

Identifying the conditions shaping group capacity to exercise influence:
Dur and De Bievre:
- Explanatory factors - government institutions (that affect relationship between interest groups and decision makers), group characteristic (resourcefulness, strategies, political positions) and issue-specific factors (depending on an issue's place on the political agenda, how much controversy it ignites).


### Policy Networks

They apply social network methods to identify important actors participating in policymaking institutions, to describe structural relations in policy fights and to explain policy outcomes.

### Lobbying Coalitions

A policy network is a set of actors connected by one or more relations. Actors are organizations, they argue that substantive issues define the boundary of a policy network, which they termed a policy domain, a policy system whose participants are interconnected by political relations. Policy actors socially construct a domain's boundary by 'mutual recognition that their preferences and actions on policy events must be taken into account by the other domain participants.'

Policy network analysis analyse and treat a relation between a pair of interest organizations as the basic unit of analysis. There is a probability of persuading them to make policy decisions favourable to group interests increase when organizations pool their political and material resources - the primary political subgroup within a policy network is the lobbying coalition. By combining finance, expertise and political experience, coalitions can create a divsion of labour.

A winning coalition often makes a more persuasive case for its preferred policy outcome than their opponents do.

### Policy Network Research

A study - community power structure study of a small German city showing how multiplex ties among its elites shaped collective action on community policies.

An organizational state model of national policy domains examined networks in the US national energy and health policy domains - replications included a comparative investigation of labour policy.

German scholars tended to view networks as a distinct governance form, an alternative to strongly centralized hierarchies and deregulated markets for settling policy disputes between the state and civil society. Overloaded governments were compelled to cooperate with interest organizations during policy formulation and implementations.

UK political scientists tended towards more theoretical and narrative accounts of policy networks - conceptualizing the policy community, a self-organizing network encompassing agents of government bureaucracies and pressure organizations. Networks grew prevalent in the British human services sector as governmental ministries, interest organizations and informal actors to make a 'hollowed out state' - using a dialectic change model to explain transformative changes in UK agricultural policy making.

### Future Directions
Let's develop:
1. How changing institutional conditions affect interest-group actions
2. Compare interest groups and policy networks cross-nationally
3. Improve interest-group theory
