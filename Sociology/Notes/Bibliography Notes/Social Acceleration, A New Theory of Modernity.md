# Social Acceleration, A New Theory of Modernity

## A collection of key ideas from the text

"Consideration of the findings of cultural history led to the conclusion that the experience of modernization is practically equivalent to the experience of acceleration." (299)

However, most aspects of societal development forgets this idea that modernization. "The reason for this is above all the “forgetfulness of time” in twentieth-century social-scientific theory, which notoriously preferred “static” models of society and modelled the modernization process (almost entirely according to the analytical pattern of a “comparative statics”) along the dimensions of structural differentiation, cultural rationalization, the individualization of personality, and the domestication of nature." (300)

It is the task of his theory to clear up what underlies such an experience of acceleration materialiser:

"Here the wavelike ebb and flow of acceleration discourse and cultural-critical calls for deceleration already indicate that social acceleration, just like other basic tendencies of modernization such as individualization or differentiation, unfolds in phases, encounters forms of resistance as well as countertendencies, and occasionally produces qualitative shifts in social arrangements by reaching certain thresholds: in this case, speed levels." (300)

Three dimensions of social acceleration: (301)
1. The phenomena of *technical acceleration*, the intentional acceleration of goal-directed processes, where modernity represents a history of the progressive acceleration of transportation and production
2. The acceleration of social change, the escalation of the rate of social change with respect to associational structures, practices and orientations (with respect to fashions, lifestyles, work, family structures)
3. The acceleration of the pace of life - represents a reaction to the scarcity of uncommitted time resources, experienced in stress or experience per unit of time

Five categories of phenomena: (302 - 303 (4) - 304 (5)):
1. Natural geophysical, biological etc speed limits
2. Territorial and cultural and structural areas that have managed to stay idle
3. Action blockages and slowdowns due to unintended side effects, economic recessions, depressive illness, traffic jams and so on.
4. To be distinguished from these are phenomena of intentional deceleration, which appear in two different forms: either as “functional” or “accelerative” deceleration in the sense of individual and collective moratoria or phases of recuperation (as in the four-week retreat of a CEO to the tranquillity of a monastery) that ultimately serve the goal of further increases of speed (for example, in the form of an increased capacity for innovation) or as “ideological” deceleration movements that often have a fundamentalist or antimodernist character and aim at genuine social slowdown or a stalling of the acceleration process in the name of a better society and a better form of life. This idea of deceleration may even be on the verge of becoming the dominant counter-ideology of the twenty-first century
5. The cultural and structural phenomena that embody a tendency toward rigidity. This tendency is the paradoxical flip side of social acceleration - it constitutes the basis for an experience of uneventfulness and standstill that underlies the rapidly changing surface of social conditions ... 'ennui', 'existential boredom', 'end of history.'

The first four can be understood as residual or reactive - they are either processes that have not yet been accelerated, or reactions to prior social acceleration.

A central result of the analysis of the consequences of accelerated social change was that the quantitative increase of speed can cause qualitative shifts in the experience of time. If the structural and cultural practices transpire at a speed lower than the turnover of 3 or 4 generations, then the space of experience remain congruent in the human experience of history. If the inverse happens, then history and life history become temporalized - politics moves from conservative to progressive.

title: Consequences, 305
When the next critical threshold is crossed when the tempo of social change reaches an intragenerational level. As indicators that this is in fact occurring, I pointed to familial and employment relations that in late modernity no longer tend to be stable over an entire adult life but rather lead to a form of life in which the life partner is inconspicuously replaced by the “life period partner” and a serial sequence of jobs takes the place of an identity-constituting profession. This further dynamization can also be demonstrated in less central or even peripheral areas of life: political orientation, car brand, insurance provider, financial institution, telephone number, and newspaper of choice no longer remain unquestionably the same for the duration of a working life. Even where they remain, in fact, unchanged, they fall under the suspicion of being merely contingent. As I argued in part 4, this leads to an altered form of time experience and hence to new forms of personal identity and political self-understanding that have come to be defi ned by the metaphors of flows and fluids. As a result of the erosion of the institutions of the welfare state, the experience of a progressive development along preestablished tracks is gradually transitioning into a perception of undefined situations with high, unforeseeable rates of change. An intragenerational tempo of change thus undeniably raises the question of the temporally specific, so to speak, load-bearing capacity of cultural reproduction and social integration. The consequences of the growing intergenerational divide in lifeworld orientations and everyday practices as well as the ongoing devaluation of experience for the exchange between generations, for the passing on of cultural knowledge, and for the maintenance of intergenerational solidarity have hardly been studied at all.
```

This high rate of change produces a growing pressure to adapt for both individuals and organisations - that one feels as though they're slipping away, or on a down escalator. However, since the conditions of actions and choice are multidimensional there is no longer any resting place.

Further increases in episodes of experience per unit of time has the potential to dramatically alter the pattern of cultural perception and processing of time. "According to this research, contemporary forms of activity like television and computer games produce a novel “short-short” pattern of time perception that stands the subjective time paradox on its head (i.e., displays both rapidly elapsing experiential time and rapidly erased memory traces). The lived events remain episodic. They are no longer linked to each other, to history, and to one’s own individual identity. On account of this, time begins in a certain way to race “at both ends”: during activities, which are felt to be short (and often stressful), it elapses very rapidly, but, at the same, in retrospect it seems to “contract” or shrink because they hardly leave any memory traces behind (as Benjamin argued, we remember with the help of photos and souvenirs). Thus, on the one hand, the days and years seem to “fly” by, while, on the other hand, looking back, we have the feeling that time literally slipped through our fingers. To sum up, the society characterized by the short-short pattern could prove to be one that is just as rich in lived events as it is poor in experience." (307)

Social acceleration is not a process that can be reduced to rationalization, differentiation or economization - it is a self-reinforcing process that is not dependent on external drivers at all ... Because the process of technical acceleration unremittingly tends to transform the established space-time regime, and with it the relationships that individuals have to society, things, and themselves, it also spurs on the logically and analytically independent process of social change. Thus the spread of the automobile or the creation of the Internet, for example, had momentous consequences for movement in space and the social forms of interaction, for communicative structures, for occupational, everyday, and free time practices, and even for associational structures and patterns of identity. Therefore, technical innovations represent a powerful instigator of social change. (308) 

"In short, the “slipping slope syndrome” that subjects people to stress and time shortage is made more acute. The threat of not being able to keep up with change and thus losing out on opportunities produces an immediate pressure to heighten the pace of life or, in other words, to “stay current.” Accelerated social change thus represents a forceful driver of increases in the pace of life." (308)

"The circle of acceleration presented in chapter 6 then comes to a complete
Close when we note how individuals and organizations react to the scarcity of time resources resulting from an increased pace of life by calling for technical acceleration. Because their time becomes scarce, they demand faster connections in transportation and computer technology, shorter waiting times and service times, etc." (309)

title: 313-314 (Politics)
As I concluded from an analysis of its temporal structures, the political project of modernity has perhaps come to its end as a result of the desynchronization of socioeconomic development and political action. Under the pressure of an ongoing contraction of the present, late modern politics becomes situational. It reacts to emerging problems without being able to maintain its claim to shape history and society. The resulting perception of an “end of history” only reflects the end of the history of classical modernity that was centered on, directed toward, and temporalized by the idea of progress. It marks the transition to a condition in which the historical forms previously thought of as noncontemporaneous once again become timelessly contemporaneous alternatives (monarchy, democracy, state formation, state disintegration, colonization, decolonization, constitutional state, welfare state, etc., no longer designate specific historical stages of development). There is a parallel to this in individual life in the experience of a “temporalized” time of everyday practice whose sequential temporal order likewise appears contingent: what occurs when, for how long, in what rhythm, and in which order is increasingly decided in the course of acting itself (that holds true for everyday tasks like shopping, work, relaxation as well as for “life events” like starting to pursue a degree, entering the workforce, having kids, getting married, etc.). Therefore, the perception of an end of history corresponds to the perception of a transition from a life based on a stable identity and the institutional safeguards of the life course regime and organized according to a “lifeplan” to one that is playful, open, and un-predictable, that is experienced as a game or as aimless drifting, depending on individual or cultural temperament.
```

In this way, situational politics of late modernity is reflected in situational identity.

"Today more than ever ignoring deadlines and speed imperatives leads to social exclusion. This is the reason why time appears to be the actual way that structural imperatives and cultural orientations are linked. It explains the way in which the conditions of individual ethical autonomy and maximal social action coordination can be simultaneously fulfilled. Enlightenment concerning the “mute normative violence” of temporal structures is therefore a primary and pressing aim of a critical theory of acceleration. Moreover, time structures also appear to be a privileged site for the genesis, And hence the analysis, of social maldevelopments or suffering- inducing social pathologies , because an illusion of almost unlimited individual freedom is produced by the minimally restrictive ethical code that predominates in late modern society, while, at the same time, an ever greater need for coordination emerges in view of the ever more complex, unsteered, and self-autonomizing interaction chains and the need to fulfill the resulting structural imperatives (roughly, the compulsions of growth and acceleration). So the ethically and politically uncontrollable trend of acceleration does not just exert an increasing normalizing force; it also harbors a growing potential to produce “pathologies of acceleration.” (316)

"Moreover, time structures also appear to be a privileged site for the genesis, and hence the analysis, of social maldevelopments or suffering- inducing social pathologies, because an illusion of almost unlimited individual freedom is produced by the minimally restrictive ethical code that predominates in late modern society, while, at the same time, an ever greater need for coordination emerges in view of the ever more complex, unsteered, and self-autonomizing interaction chains and the need to fulfill the resulting structural imperatives (roughly, the compulsions of growth and acceleration). So the ethically and politically uncontrollable trend of acceleration does not just exert an increasing normalizing force; it also harbors a growing potential to produce “pathologies of acceleration.” (316)

Thus, a progressive dynamization of exclusion-induced suffering, producing fear and anxiety within those who are not yet excluded. It shapes the action orientation of individuals of being 'left behind.' Love and friendship are seen as contingent and personal achievement must be renewed to secure social esteem. Thus, our society becomes restless. Additionally, there will be a restructuring of the order of values as a result of problems with time - putting out fires, for example. (316-317)

People believe therein that because of these short-term expectations, also brought in with the entertainment industry, as well as this feeling of being left behind, it produces the feelings that one no longer has time for any important things in life.

```ad-quote
title: What is our end?
"The first possibility consists in the formation of a new form of institutional facilitation and stabilization of the acceleration process and thus the attainment of a new equilibrium at a higher level of speed." This is not applicable with deliberative-democratic politics. (320)

"Therefore, a second possibility would be the definitive abandonment of the project of modernity, which could lead to the emergence of genuinely “post-modern” forms of subjectivity and a new kind of (sub-)politics ... that would dispense with the claims of autonomy and control and for just this reason be able to affirm late modern manifestations of social acceleration. New modes of perception, new ways to process speed, and new forms of individual and collective self-relations would have to develop, and, by definition, nothing can yet be said about them." (321)

"A third possibility consists in the converse attempt to assert the
modern aspiration to shape human affairs against the self-autonomizing forces of acceleration. As I have shown in chapter 11, this requires that we, as it were, “reach for the emergency brake” to prevent the social tempo from surpassing the threshold beneath which it can still be politically and individually controlled." (321)

But who would do this? What about the crisis of the modern conception of politics?

"From a logical point of view, this abyss is characterized by the final collapse of the antinomies of movement and inertia and the realization of the vision, which has accompanied modernity from the very start, of a frenetic standstill as the flip side of a total mobilization. From an empirical point of view, however, presumably long before that point is reached the abyss will be embodied in either the collapse of the ecosystem or in the ultimate breakdown of the modern social order and its values under the pressure of growing acceleration pathologies and the power of the enemies these foster. It stands to reason that modern society will have to pay for the loss of the ability to balance movement and inertia with nuclear or climatic catastrophes, with the diffusion at a furious pace of new diseases, or with new forms of political collapse and the eruption of uncontrolled violence, which can be particularly expected where the masses excluded from the processes of acceleration and growth take a stand against the acceleration society." (322)

"The time squeeze Linda is experiencing obviously is not so much a consequence of her insatiability and greed, but much more a result of the fact that all the claims made on her time-budget appear to be legitimate, well-justied claims. It is neither unfair nor inappropriate that the students require her teacher to be prepared, nor is it unfair or unjust of the applicants to expect that their applications are read carefully, and certainly, the kids, the lover, and the body deserve attention, too. But when we add up the time needed to properly fulfill all the entries on the list, we arrive at an illegitimate, even an impossible, amount of time which probably exceeds the twenty-four hours of the day by far—not even considering the fact that Linda herself has legitimate claims and expectations to do things she loves to do without anyone making claims on her time-budget, too. All those claims emanate from particular contexts, and they are legitimate in light of those contexts. As a result, the multiplication of contexts and arenas of our daily lives through the process of progressive functional differentiation is one reason for the aggravating mismatch that results in an habitual or dispositional squeeze. What is the role of technology in this?" (27)

```ad-quote
title: Social Class 30-31
In work, underprivileged employees have very little time-sovereignty, pressure is put on them by the boss or by external authorities who regulate their time-budget. It is them they can directly locate as the source of pressure. For Linda, the source of pressure is outside the situation, it is herself she needs to blame. Outside work, work-pressures cease for the former, but everyday time-pressures might weigh even heavier for them, because they cannot easily alleviate it by exchanging money for time, e.g. by taking a cab or a fast train or using professional cleaning services—or high-speed technologies at that. Consequently, there is some justication for saying that for the well-educated and highly qualied elites working in white-collar jobs, the locus of pressure is to a signicant extent internalized, while for many less qualied, poorly paid blue-collar workers, the locus is very often external, i.e. it is their boss or some externally createdsynchronization problem. 

For those who are excluded from the hamster wheels of work by unemployment or disease, the situation is yet again different. Very often, they suffer from the fact that there are no or few direct claims on their time-budget—social exclusion in its most depressing form often is characterized by the fact that no one expects anything from you — while they lack the means and hence the opportunities to form concrete, realizable expectations on time-use themselves. (When you are out of work, isolated and without money, neither the shopping malls nor the musical theater or the gym feel an impact on your time budget.) Hence, the socially excluded are outside the accelerating system of demands and opportunities, or outside the machines of allocation. But this state of affairs is highly problematic too, since it implies that the available time is radically devalued. Therefore, social exclusion leads to a time-problem of a dierent sort: the gap between the abstract list of claims that should be met to lead a respectable life (including all the requirements on capacities and possessions, resources and capabilities, and even documents needed to get a job) and the means to meet them enlarges by the day. The chances to catch up with those who run inside the treadmills of late-modern life decrease progressively if you lack the economic, cultural, social, and bodily capital to even start the race. If those who start from a privileged position run as fast as they can to stay in the game, it becomes a completely rational form of behavior for those who nd themselves far behind from the beginning and without the necessary resources to catch up to never even start to run.

In conclusion, even though the working and living conditions of social groups—and their capacities to use and command time-saving devices and technologies — differ to a highly signicant degree, the mismatch between the temporal requirements on the to do list and the resources at hand reappears in different forms with all of them. The imperatives of speed are not uniform, but they do aect all social groups, milieus, or classes as well as sexes. The social speedgame and its imperatives toward optimization appear to be quite
pervasive.

Put differently, the process of material dynamization driven by the consumption of physical energy leads to a “de-synchronization” in the earth’s atmosphere that results in earth’s warming.

As I have argued at length elsewhere (Rosa 2013: 251–76), the current weakness of Western democracy—which can be seen from both the failing attractiveness it provides for non-Western states in Africa or Asia and the decline in support and credibility it earns in its core countries (cf. Crouch 2004)—basically arises from the fact that the democratic processes of will formation, decision making, and implementation, by their very nature, are inevitably time-consuming. In fact, the more pluralistic and post-conventionalist society gets, and the more complex its networks, chains of transaction, and contexts of action and decision become, the slower democracy proceeds. Thus, while the speed of cultural and economic life and technological change increases, the pace of democracy slows down — and hence, we observe a frightening extent of de-synchronization between politics and the social systems it tries to control or steer. Thus, in the twenty-rst century, democratic governments no longer appear to be a pace-maker of social change; rather, they have shifted to a role of “re extinguisher” and to a mode of “muddling through,” at best; reacting to the pressures created elsewhere rather than shaping our shared world.

In fact, to quite a signicant extent, the speed of nancial transaction has become too high for human agents to understand or steer it at all: it is left to computer algorithms that make prots from exploiting fluctuations within microseconds (see Chapter 4). Alas, this necessarily led to a serious de-synchronization between the financial markets and the “real” or material economy up to a point where these two had little connection with each other.

One of the most striking features of both burnout and depression, is the complete lack of dynamics. For those who fall into the trap of a burnout or depression, time is standing still, the world and/or the self appear to be “frozen,” devoid of motion and signicance (Bschor et al. 2004). This has led researchers like Alain Ehrenberg (2010) to suppose that depression is a stress reaction of a de-synchronized psyche to the speed requirements of modern life. The fact that all over the world, journals and magazines regularly double their sales by reporting on stress, burnout, depression, and exhausted selves on their cover page could serve as an amber light signaling an impending state of de-synchronization even for those who are skeptical of the diagnosing practices of our medical services.

Problems with Rosa:

The moral and political challenges of Hartmut Rosa's theory of resonance.

```ad-error
title: 9-10
To be sure, Rosa takes pains to specify how different conditions can advance or prevent one’s ability to cultivate a sensitivity to resonance, which is an important and persuasive element of his sociological theory. But given the highly subjective nature of resonance, an assumption about the existential experience of others with respect to resonance is morally troubling. A related issue arises with respect to illness and disability. Rosa makes many intriguing claims about various health-related conditions as indicative or symptomatic of impaired relations to the world. Early on, he highlights early twentieth-century medical practitioners who “saw loss of responsivity or capacity for resonance itself as the root of all disease, defining health as an organism’s capacity to resonate with (or respond to) the world,” noting as well more recent claims in neuropsychology that the brain characteristically functions as an “organ of resonance” (Rosa [2019](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR12 "Rosa, Hartmut. 2019. Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World. Translated by James C. Wagner. Cambridge: Polity Press."), 75). With respect to individual conditions or ailments, some of Rosa’s statements are marked as speculative, but they include: (1) the suggestion that “modern ailments of civilization such as asthma may be indicative of an impaired relation to the world” (Rosa [2019](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR12 "Rosa, Hartmut. 2019. Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World. Translated by James C. Wagner. Cambridge: Polity Press."), 55); (2) the statement that “ever-increasing rates of obesity in the modern world seem to obviously suggest a reified relationship to the world oriented toward increase, domination and conquest” and corollary readings of anorexia and bulimia as symptomatic of “loss of world” and “pathological acceleration,” respectively (Rosa [2019](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR12 "Rosa, Hartmut. 2019. Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World. Translated by James C. Wagner. Cambridge: Polity Press."), 61); (3) the notion that sleep disorders are linked to an unwillingness to “let go of the world,” due to a lack of trust in the world’s reliability (Rosa [2019](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR12 "Rosa, Hartmut. 2019. Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World. Translated by James C. Wagner. Cambridge: Polity Press."), 75); and (4) the claim that medications such as Ritalin and Prozac are “meant to make bearable an otherwise intolerable relation to the world” (Rosa [2019](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR12 "Rosa, Hartmut. 2019. Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World. Translated by James C. Wagner. Cambridge: Polity Press."), 62).

In all of these examples, the narrowing of explanatory formula to two fundamental motives or triggers—loss of resonance or susceptibility to alienation—fails to capture the complex causality of suffering and, in other cases, plays into a problematic tendency to pathologize conditions better viewed, if a plural and capacious approach to resonance is the goal, as forms of difference, on the one hand, or indicative of structural problems, on the other. The use of the word “pathology” in sociological critique or critical theory of course forthrightly signals that there is an underlying normative framework. And indeed one of Rosa’s fundamental commitments is to elaborate and avow an idea of the good life, a task which he sees mainstream sociology as problematically avoiding in its “fixation on resources” and “confusion of quantity of resources with quality of life” (Rosa [2019](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR12 "Rosa, Hartmut. 2019. Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World. Translated by James C. Wagner. Cambridge: Polity Press."), 23). And yet there is a difference between avowed normativity and implied normalcy: the suggestion that forms of mental or physical disability are expressive of deficient resonance risks failing to recognize and honor diverse forms of life as they are lived. To take an especially challenging example, it’s hard to know how the non-hearing community might view this book, given the centrality it gives to voice and music as privileged sites of resonance.

It might be the case that some of the speculative observations I have singled out reflect a certain level of abstraction or a more generalized sociological observation, as for example when we say that the culture in general promotes ADHD but then feel very differently about its causes and distinctive qualities when a loved one is diagnosed with it. For Rosa, ADHD is classed among the many indicators of the psychological crisis brought on by acceleration: imperatives of competition, growth, and optimization result in a series of stress and burnout-related disorders that should be “understood as a crisis of exhaustion in the game of escalation” (Rosa [2019](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR12 "Rosa, Hartmut. 2019. Resonance: A Sociology of Our Relationship to the World. Translated by James C. Wagner. Cambridge: Polity Press."), 427). But given Rosa’s commitment to moving beyond the objectivism and quantifying impulse of sociology, it seems imperative to retain an interpretive openness and curiosity toward the many forms of life in contemporary society, to hold off on precipitous judgments about what they might symbolize with respect to acceleration under capitalism. Additionally, forms of life that may present as non-normative, neurodiverse, or disabled can potentially teach us something about resonance, particularly with respect to experiences of time. As Ellen Samuels conveys in her influential essay on “crip time,” precisely because disability can prevent one from living within the expected rhythms of contemporary life, it forces one to open to “new rhythms, new patterns of thinking and feeling and moving through the world” (Samuels [2017](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR13 "Samuels, Ellen. 2017. Six Ways of Looking at Crip Time. Disability Studies Quarterly. 
https://doi.org/10.18061/dsq.v37i3.5824
.")). In words that resonate with Rosa’s own value commitments, she writes: “[Crip time] insists that we listen to our bodyminds so closely, so attentively, in a culture that tells us to divide the two and push the body away from us while also pushing it beyond its limits” (Samuels [2017](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-023-00182-9#ref-CR13 "Samuels, Ellen. 2017. Six Ways of Looking at Crip Time. Disability Studies Quarterly. 
https://doi.org/10.18061/dsq.v37i3.5824
.")).

If a more attuned approach seems required with respect to disability and neurodiversity, a more developed structural analysis seems needed, by contrast, in the passages devoted to obesity, asthma, and medications. These conditions require an analysis that takes into account such factors as socioeconomic standing, the food system, the welfare system, environmental factors, and the power of the pharmaceutical industry. While psychological factors can of course be involved in cases of obesity and in eating disorders more generally, obesity socio-economically speaking has to do with the availability and price of foods for any given individual or community, and the extraordinary influence of corporate actors in the food system, such as advertisers and corn producers in the US. To read a psychology off of a larger systemic force, in this case one of “increase, domination, and conquest,” is to compress a structural condition into a psychological one, through what we might call a socio-psychic fallacy. Again, given Rosa’s extraordinary sensitivity to experiential and psychological perspectives, this seems out of keeping with the value commitments motivating his work. In the case of Rosa's discussions of medications such as Prozac and Ritalin, both experiential and larger systemic forces are also critically at play: big pharma has a lot to do with creating the sense the medication is needed to make the world tolerable. That view could therefore be seen as highly ideological rather than appropriately diagnostic. And yet from the side of those who use and need these medications, it is a scalar leap to imagine that their experiences have to do with a relationship to the conditions of modernity rather than a more immediately felt range of symptoms that may be complexly determined by environmental and biological factors.
