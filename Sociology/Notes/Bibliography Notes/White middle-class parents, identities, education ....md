```ad-abstract
At a time when the public sector and state education (in the United Kingdom) is under threat from the encroaching marketisation policy and private finance initiatives, our research reveals white middle-class parents who in spite of having the financial opportunity to turn their backs on the state system are choosing to assert their commitment to the urban state-run comprehensive school. Our analysis examines the processes of 'thinking and acting otherwise', and demonstrates the nature of the commitment the parents make to the local comprehensive school. However, it also shows the parents' perceptions of the risk involved and their anxieties that these give rise to. The middle-class parents are thus caught in a web of moral ambiguity, dilemmas and ambivalence, trying to perform 'the good/ethical self while ensuring the 'best' for their children.

## Article Introduction

Educational strategies are key to studies. This paper explores how strategies that appear to be 'acting against self-interest' are related to wider senses of identity and identification, and the extent to which these are influenced by class fraction, ethnicity and gender.

[[Andrew Sayer]] argues that the moral dimension of social life not only a basis of social order but also a basis for resistance to the existing order.

We believed that sections of the middle classes engaged in a form of resistance by sending their children to the local urban comprehensive.

Many middle-class parents behave by sending their children to 'comprehensive ' schools, very few in the areas where we have tried to access them seemingly send their children to those schools performing far below the national average according to the five A*-C GCSE economy.

They face moral dilemmas of how to balance ideals against social privilege and tactical imperative for self-advancement: engaged in implicit psycho-social conflicts on weighing up the principled moral and political beliefs against doing 'what's best' for their children.

Tensions: urban comprehensives are uncomfortable and threatening yet this the parents motivations are beset with moral ambiguity.


## Methods and data sources

### How was this data collected?

This paper is the findings of a 30-month Economic and Social Research Council (UK) funded study.

Interview: one parent from 125 white middle-class households. Aimed to capture the diversity of middle-class identifies and the consequences of these differences for dilemmas of choice.

Our target are middle-class parents who are seemingly committed to comprehensive schooling as an educational principle; those who deliberately committed to comprehensive schooling as an educational principle.

Ethnographic interviewing practices that allow for a mix of open ended questions and careful prompting.

~~### What, if any are the pitfalls behind how the data was gathered? Does the author address this?

### Special notes on the method chosen.

#### What is identity and who are the parents in the study?

We take the view that identity is not unitary but both multiple and situated. From this perspective, then, the parents' white ethnicity and class fraction, together with their histories, are crucial. The historical dimension of their experience and its influence is masked by their current social positioning.

(paraphrased below, 263)

We have established three types of 'historical class locations':
1. Established middle class, parents who attended private schools
2. Second-generation middle class, parents who went to grammar school and were the first to achieve higher education
3. A minority were public-sector workers, first generation middle class - went to university and were the first to do so.

Less than one-half of the parents originally were from the North East of England, most are not from Norton. Place and time matter a lot. Additionally, the middle class is small - 8%. It has implications of power relationships and how they see themselves in relation to 'the Other'

The parents could be regarded as centre left politically but not politically active. All talked about having a commitment to the welfare state and importance of state-funded schooling. (p, 264)

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Motivation for choice of the local comprehensive

Most of the parents did make a conscious decision to send their children to a local comprehensive school.

"An issue of greater importance for these parents was that of critical mass and the need for assurance that there are other children at this school 'like us'" (264):

```ad-quote

```

As long as there was people 'like us' then they do not need to work the market.

"Most [participants] talked in terms of a moral agenda with respect to supporting state education but also with an emphasis on the type of adult they would like their children to grow up to be. In doing so the parents are arguably performing the 'good self' or the 'ethical self' ([[Skeggs]], 2005) and are trying to ensure their children do likewise." (266)

Parents also talked about wanting their children to mix with others from different backgrounds to see the 'problems' that some experience. This 'diverse experience' represents a form of capital. "Rather than separate themselves in some 'ivory tower', these parents may be seeking to ensure a useful experience for their children as future citizens while holding true to their own 'good self'" (266)

Overall, "these [choices] are not merely based on a single principle of politics, morality, ethics or pragmatism, but are contingent upon their child's happiness and academic success. At times, standing by this decision is difficult if their child falters in her - or in fact more probably his - academic progress." (267)

### Risks and anxieties

"In spite of their children to experience diversity, one area of risk lies in the association with 'the Other', with those 'not like us.'" (267)

These can be "bad boys", those whose families are in prison, so "it was generally the case that they stuck to their own social groups." ... "Not only are these others 'not like us' but often, in addition, 'they don't like us'. Consequently the middle-class are called names - 'the poshies' or 'swotties'" (267)

The Charvers, referred to by almost all of the Norton respondents, are the unacceptable face of diversity. It is they whom the middle-class families position themselves in opposition to. They draw a 'moral boudnary' (Sayer 2005b) presented, at least in terms of their chidren's 'good behaviour' and 'hard work', to distinguish and set themselves apart from the tarnishing influence of these working-class groups. Consenquently, what is more a concern than the name-calling is maintaining this moral boundary, to ensure that their children are not corrupted, distracted or prevented from achieving the goal of academic success and moreover maintaining what Skeggs describes as 'knowing how to display one's subjectivity properly ' (2005, 973)'
```

These middle class parents thus must maintain 'the good self' but also not allow themselves to fall to 'unacceptable levels'

Maintaining the moral boundary depends on good-quality teaching and ensuring the teachers have high expectations of their children. Being in the top sets is important to the parents and their parents emphasise the need for them to work harder to stay there. Those whose children are 'struggling' grapple with this dilemma of wanting to do the right thing, and wanting what's best for their children. (p, 269)

### Making it work for them - ensuring futurity.

Middle class parents are clear in wanting their children to succeed within certain acceptable parameters.

Anxious about the quality of academic experience as indicated above, they employed various strategies to ensure success.
```

In monitoring the children, parents monitored the teachers and thus they contacted the head teacher directly.

State schools did not provide a middle-class style of education such as music lessons, dance and drama but here "parents ensured alternatives, providing music tutors and expending many hours taxiing children to out-of-school classes and events." (270)

The middle-class children are also perceived as favoured by these constitutions - "having a 'halo' effect on the children's achievements." (ibid)


"Here, middle-class families may be deemed to be *acting against self-interest* largely as a result of their moral or quasi political/ideological position. However, as it turns out for them, or rather their children, the children do well out of this move." (271)

They find themselves in the top set, dominate the Gifted and Talented scheme and are treated as special. These students are valued by schools which strengthens their privileged positions.

```ad-quote
title: 271
"Secure in their sense of themselves and their children's ability they manage their anxieties by employing their educational knowledge and various capitals to ensure success; ultimately, if the worse comes to the worse, they always have the economic resources to bail out. Even though they profess the egalitarian principles of supporting state education, they have no qualms about their children benefiting from the Gifted and Talented scheme despite, as many of them often said, less advantaged children who would benefit more never seemed to get picked for the scheme,. The Gifted and Talented scheme was after all designed to keep the middle classes in state education; as far as these parents are concerned it would seem to be working."
```

White middle-class parents are straddling different and competing identities in an attempt to reconcile their ideological position on state education and their parental commitments.

In terms of ensuring futurity for their children, middle-class parents behave individualistically. Although these parents are interested around cultural capital accumulation, they have a contemptuous attitude to other social class groups that may threaten their diversity.

"What emerging, therefore, is that the white middle-class parents we have studied manage their anxieties, dilemmas and ambivalence by ensuring a successful, educational experience for their children." (271)
