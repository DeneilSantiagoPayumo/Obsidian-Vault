## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Feminism as a sensation

```ad-quote
"Experiences like this:: they seem to accumulate over time, gathering like things in a bag, but the bag is your body, so that you feel like you are carrying more and more weight." (23)


```

Becoming a girl is here about how you experience your body in relation to space. Gendering operates in how bodies take up space ... to become accommodating, we take up less space. The more accommodating we are the less space we have to take up. Gender: a loop, tightening.

A world can shrink when we shrink - [[Judith Butler]] thinks of 'girling' as a social mechanism. From sex, gender follows - gender fatalism. Boys will be boys. "Gender fatalism rests on ideas about nature as well as time: what "will be" is decided by "what is." This is what boys are like; girls, too. But likeliness becomes not only an explanation ... but an expectation." (25)

To be assigned sex in a binary system is a way of being directed towards the future. It is not simply the sign, but who addresses you and how you receive it. "Girling is enacted not only through being explicitly addressed as a girl, but in the style or mode of address." (26)

Violence is seen as justifiable because gender fatalism has made the violence directed against you forgivable and inevitable.

### Feminist Consciousness

To become feminist means involving a process of recognizing that what you are up against cannot be located or reduced to an object or thing - you must reiterate your beliefs.

"The personal is structural" (30)
"We need structure to give evidence of structure"

```

"Feminist and antiracist consciousness involves not just finding the words, but through the words, how they point, realizing how violence is direct: violence is directed toward some bodies more than others. To give a problem a name can change not only how we register an event but whether we register an event." (34)

To claim something is sexist means it needs modification. Even sexual culture can be inviting - sexual banter. We shrug off banter and 'compliments' just to get by. We adapt to a system that comprises our capacity to inhabit a world on equal terms.

Feminists disrupt the flow of conversation, create arguments, seen as argumentative - they become a problem when they describe a problem.
