## Approaches to neoliberalism

### Neoliberalism as political ideology 3

This is a common trait shared by intellectual historians and political theorists. This has done great to identify both diversity and coherence within neoliberal thought - recognised as a response to the global crisis of liberalism in the 1930s, leading to the formation of a 'neoliberal thought collective'. They believed that economic planning threatened to destroy the means of individual liberty: the state should be repurposed and redeployed to create and uphold markets and competition.

A summary: ideas were promoted by the effectively organised and well-funded transnational neoliberal movement adopted by sympathetic politicians and translated into national policymaking environments: the UK and US as the most involved in this. They colonised key sites of social scientific authority and expertise, the discipline of economics and IMF.

This strand of scholarship draws attention to the role of political agency - identifying specific historical actors with a consequential role in public debate and state decision-making.

This focuses on the elites at the expense of grassroot mobilisation and political other change, as well as long and short term economic changes.

### Neoliberalism as a form of capitalism 4

The emphasis is placed on the collapse of class compromise, generating a 'crisis of capitalist accumulation' and compelling the class to construct a new flexible 'regime of accumulation' - the restoration of class power, promoting reforms to capitalism that enabled its globalisation and financialization in pursuit of profitability.

There are, other than Marxist inspired accounts, alternative explanations of neoliberalism - neoliberal policies were the product of globalisation of capitalism that took off in the 1960s in the form of multinational business and the liberation of financial markets from national control, transferring power to globalised capital and leading to the reward of inward investment that pursued 'responsible' policies of neoliberalism.

Other scholars have integrated economics with ideology: Mark Blyth argues that 'stagflation' that allowed neoliberalists to define and provide a coherent solution to the crisis of the 1970s;

This interprets neoliberalism as a response to the changing material conditions of capitalism. Such accounts have huge disadvantages: the grand scale of this analysis downplays the importance of social and cultural change and the role of politics in mediating between broad economic change and the everyday lived experiences.

### Neoliberal governmentality 5

The third is inspired by [[Michel Foucault]] - neoliberalism should be understood as a 'rationality' in which 'generalised competition' has become a societal norms where individual subjectivity has been reformed according to the ideal of entrepreneurialism.

This remaking of society has been produced by power dispersed across sites of knowledge and many agencies, guiding the ways in which people conduct themselves.

This sees neoliberalism as an abstract, mobile and dynamic logic that is assembled in varied forms - perceived in the cultural logic of everyday life. This view of neoliberalism offers a map of cultural change than an explicit account of causation.

Here we can see neoliberalism as a phenomenon that reshapes everyday life. Scholars taking this approach transformed individual's relationship to money, debt and savings: how individuals has been encouraged to be entrepreneurs of the self and how neoliberalism transformed democracy.


## The dominance of the political in narratives of twentieth-century Britain

Thatcher believed she is 'reshaping the consensus' that led Britain to its decline.

This narrative from consensus to Thatcherism has a number of weaknesses: the characterisation of Britain as a 'social democratic' state implies that Keynesian and the welfare state were instrumental models of Britain. This misses out key features of the British economic model, the uniquely national character of the economy.

The use of the 'neoliberal' to describe contemporary Britain produces a tendency to view the transformation seen in this period as a result of neoliberal ideology and ideologues, the description presupposes causation.

Using neoliberalism as the dominant grand narrative to describe the period means we tend to read all social and cultural changes as the result of the discursive political and economic changes associated with neoliberalism.


Other historians have offered other reasons: from deindustrialisation as the prominent narrative, the rise of popular individualism, and more. In integrating social, cultural, economic and technological narratives, we offer an account of the human agents and structural forces at work in bringing about the transformation of Britain.


## Intellectual and political history 9

Intellectual historians have examined the political economists and thinkers grouped under the label 'neoliberal.' These approaches are transnational, and help historians avoid taking too parochial a view of Britain's post-war history.

[[Stuart Hall]] and [[Andrew Gamble]] deployed ideas of 'The New Right' or 'Monetarist Philosophy' to characterise their ideological objectives of the Conservative policy. Other intellectual historians focused on the personal belief inculcated by Thatcher's Methodist upbringing and more.

... skipped a ton ...

In an analysis of the success and failure of Thatcherism, many has emphasised that her revolution was far from complete - she did not permanently shrink government spending as a proportion of GDP. We can see the stubborn persistence of social democracy. This work views Thatcherism not as a solution to the crisis of the 1970s but a complex amalgam of older right-wing tenets with newer neoliberal ideas.

The prominence of the concept of neoliberalism reflected a need to explain why 'free market' principles continued to exercise considerable political influence even as the parties that were their initial sponsors were ejected from office by centre-left governments.

...

Peter Sloman argues that neoliberals suggested that cash transfers to the poor was the best way to enable everyone to participate in markets to meet all their needs and Thatcher recognised that these transfers were necessary to defuse potential tensions as she rolled back welfare provision and restructured labour markets, with New Labour reconciled to the idea of using fiscal transfers to tackle poverty in the context of a growing economy and rising inequality.

Some people believed it was tradition and incentive on the poor that led New Labour thinking.

Jim Phillips and Guy Ortolano suggested that neoliberalism was far from a dominant force - arguing that the development corporation held to a vision of a 'property-owning social democracy' encompassing both public and private housing.

...

Historians have begun to trace the pre-history of neoliberal ideas such as individual freedom, disrupting the idea that neoliberal revolution was engineered solely from the right - Ben Jackson traced neoliberal ideas within the liberal parties.

Other scholars traced a line of influence from broader left politics into the neoliberal revolution of the 1980s.

...

These accounts suggest a complex view of the transformation of the 19970s and 80s - Thatcher was just one outcome and there were 'roads not taken'. New Labour operated in a post-Thatcherite landscape but it was not a simply a vehicle for neoliberal ideas. Thatcherism may have been the outcome of some contingent and unstable developments but some moves in the direction of neoliberal ideas were probably on the cards even if Callaghan won.

### Economic History 15

Historians sought to emphasise how politics has interacted with specific domestic and international economic conditions.

The most well-developed economic aspects challenged the established methods of managing the economy: fine-tuning a balance between full employment and minimal inflation. The politics of income policies overwhelmed the Heath government and more.

All three of macroeconomic indicators were affected by the global spike of oil engineered by OPEC. The resulting cuts to public expenditure was the price to pay for accessing IMF credit - but this subsequent view of the death of Keynesian and its replacement with monetarism is inaccurate.  Neil Rollings show that consensual tendencies of the Confederation of British Industry, her government maintained a close relationship with the organisation as a means of keeping pay levels under control.

Aled Davis argues that the neoliberal turn in economic government can be understood as a capitalist revolt against state intervention in the economy that was triggered by a steep decline in profits. This is a materialist assumption, which is primarily an important reminder that even if we reject the idea that dynamics of capitalism autonomously determine politics, society and culture, those dynamics cannot be ignored.

Beyond the domestic British economy, changes to the international economic order has been identified as a cause of the transformation of Britain in the late Twentieth century. It can be argued that the linked dynamics of expanded global trade, the multi-nationalisation of business weakened the material conditions of nationalist economic policy.

Britain's role in constituting globalised finance which had been constrained by nation states through free movement of capital is notable. 

Rather than looking at neoliberalism, an alternative way to think about the political economy of Britain is to see it as a product of rapid deindustrialisation and the transition to a service-based economy after 1970s - that many of the key features of neoliberal Britain are the product of the decline of industrial employment. The loss of industrial jobs made the Thatcher's governments' task of weakening trade unions easier.

This outcome suggests that the financialization of British society was a rational coping mechanism in the face of fundamental economic change.

Tomlinson argued that a fundamental effect of deindustrialisation was to compromise the ability of politicians to implement the neoliberal rollback of the welfare states - it created a situation where governments were forced to subsidise wages.

Centring deindustrialisation prompts us to ask what cause the disappearance of industrial work. An orthodox economist would point to technological change, relative factor costs and increased demand for services in an affluent economy. Evidence of the decline of industrial jobs used to prove this point, suggesting that neoliberalism is a distraction from the transformation of glboal capitalism.

...

An examination of British economic history tends to push back the ideas and politics centric account of neoliberalism, encouraging historians to recognise the changing structural conditions of Britain. Historians have not restored to the monocausal material explanations and have been alive as to how economic dynamics interacted with neoliberal ideas, the imperative of national statecraft, long-term social changes, and the legacy of Britain's imperial past and decolonisation.

### Social and cultural history 20

One way of narrating the social and cultural history of Britain is a neoliberal period where new individualistic forms of self-fashioning and cultures of greed and selfishness dominate - work, family and community are relentlessly colonised and distorted by the demands of neoliberal economies and ideologies.

Look at the call centre - rows of isolated workers servicing the demands of consumers and capitalism.

Nikolas Rose depicted neoliberalism as one that compels the individual to be free, embrace autonomy and treat themself as an enterprise. Ellen Boucher on studying public reactions uncovers an emerging 'neoliberal sensibility' focused on assessing risk and taking personal responsibility.

Many scholars suggested that the new left politics of the 1960s and 70s fed into the advent of Thatcherism - that neoliberalism alone may not be enough to explain the shifts in society and we should think about modern British history in terms of several cross-cutting metanarratives. One such trend - the rise of individualism and the decline of deference.

Studies of the family and neoliberalism have stressed the tension between the impulse towards individualism in neoliberal thinking and requirement - the discourse of 'family values', their economic model requiring the family to shoulder the burden of responsibility for caring for its members.

Neoliberal thinkers adopted the discourse of family values as their economic model required the family to shoulder the burden of responsibility for caring its members as the state retreated from it - the pressures on women and wives, finding that responsibility was a theme in conceptualisation of women as mothers and workers, where only where the women involved could use private resources to take responsibility of the homes.

Women were still responsible and required to work more to meet the needs of the family.

Camilla Schofield examined the themes of entrepreneurship - demonstrating how Black activism was rearticulated in the 1980s because of the money the Thatcher governments funnelled into Black, anti-racist and ethnic groups for pragmatic reasons in the aftermath of the urban uprisings in 1981.  Individualism too was incubated by left-wing apparatus of race relation relations.

Work on this social and cultural history complicates narratives of the rise of neoliberal subjectivities, suggesting that developments such as entrepreneurship and individualism had diverse and complicated causes. It shows how partial the reach of neoliberalism into British society and institutions was.
