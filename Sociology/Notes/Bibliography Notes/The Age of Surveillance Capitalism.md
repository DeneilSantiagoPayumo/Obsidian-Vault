## CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: A COUP FROM ABOVE

309

Surveillance Capitalism departs from market capitalism in three ways: it insists on the privilege of unfettered freedom and knowledge. Then, it abandons long-standing organic reciprocities with people. Finally, the spectre of life in this hive betrays a collective societal vision sustained by indifference and material expression in Big Other.

Big Other is a "distributed and largely uncontested new expression power".
In her paper, she defines Big Other as a “_ubiquitous networked institutional regime that records, commodifies and modifies everyday experience_”, a “_sovereign power…that annihilates the freedom achieved by the rule of law…creating new markets of behavioral prediction and modification_” and as “_a global architecture existing somewhere between nature and God._” (Zuboff, 2015, pp. 75–82)

I have called this institutionalized relationship to human-generated data "radical indifference."
```


```ad-summary
title: About SC...
Tech companies like Google and Facebook collect personal data in order to sell advertisements to third parties, which in turn are then enabled to target their audiences very accurately and influence their decisions on the basis of behavioral prediction. [This is what Zuboff calls ‘_surveillance capitalism_’:](https://www.diggitmagazine.com/node/4239) it centers around the collection and commodification of data in order to modify user behavior (Zuboff, 2015). Most users of the free and convenient services provided by surveillance capitalists were largely unaware of the data tracking operations they were involved in and due to social dependency, have given up on privacy and rights in order to keep using (Zuboff, 2015, pp. 83–84).

Zuboff claims that this computer-mediated age of surveillance allowed for the emergence of "_Big Other"_, which is a new form of power that commodifies, controls, and affects behavior and daily experience and which will slowly transform human agency into “_a new kind of automaticity_” (Zuboff, 2015, p. 82).

### 1. *Freedom* and *Knowledge*

Surveillance capitalists are no different than any other by demanding uttermost freedom - they want freedom from law, from regulation, from practice. This pattern reflects two bedrock assumptions of capitalism: that markets are unknowable and that ignorance produced by this lack of knowledge thereof requires wide-ranging freedom of action for market actors.

This notion exists before modern communication and transportation - when life is local.

309-310

The author describes both Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek and their discussions over the market. They both link freedom and ignorance. With Hayek, the mystery of the market is a great thing that many people can behave effectively whilst remaining ignorant - humans can choose their own pursuits as there's no control to guide them.

He choose the market over democracy, that the market system enabled the division of labour and the 'coordinated utilization of resources based on equally divided knowledge.' This system is the only one compatible with freedom.

Big Other challenge this notion: the market is not invisible, the competitive struggle among surveillance capitalists produce the compulsion towards totality. Surveillance capitalism replaces mystery with certainty as it substitutes rendition, behavioural modification, and prediction for the old "unsurveyable pattern", reversing the ideal of the market as unknowable.

311

Surveillance capitalism is instead defined by an unprecedented convergence of freedom and knowledge - the degree of which corresponding to the scope of instrumentation power, hijacking the division of inclusion and exclusion that revenue depend. These capitalists claim freedom to order knowledge, and then leverage that knowledge to expand their freedom.

This is unprecedented as they rely on the one resource that distinguishes the surveillance capitalists from traditional utopianisms: the financial and intellectual capital that permits the transformation of the world, in the architecture of the Big Other. Surveillance capital derives from dispossession of human experience: our lives are scraped and sold to fund their freedom and our subjugation, their knowledge and our ignorance about what they know.

Surveillance capitalism's control and command of the division of learning in society are the signature feature that breaks with the old justification of the invisible ahdn and its entitelement - the combination of how both work accelerate the asymmetry of power. We must acknowledge: surveillance capitalists know too much to qualify for freedom.

311-312

### 2. After Reciprocity

Surveillance capitalists abandon the organic reciprocities with people that have been a mark of capitalism's endurance and adaptability.

Firstly, they no longer rely on people as consumers - the axis of supply and demand orients the capitalist firm to businesses intent on anticipating the behaviour of populations, groups, and individuals. The "users" are sources of raw material for a digital-age production process aimed at a new business consumer.

Second, large surveillance capitalists employ few people compared to their massive computational resources - this pattern where a small educated workforce leverage the power of capital-intensive infrastructure is called "hyper scale".

The author delves into some history - Google and Facebook employed less and rose to the top of market capitalization than General Motors.

Hyperscale firms have become emblematic of modern digital Capitalism, representing social and economic challenges, such as their impact on employment and wages.

313

Not all hyperscale firms are surveillance capitalism - this book merely focuses on the convergence of these two domains. The surveillance capitalists that operate at hyperscale dramatically diminish any reliance on their societies as sources of employees.

The absence of organic reciprocities is a matter of exceptional importance in light of the relationship between market capitalism and democracy - in America, the violation of consumer reciprocities awakened a march towards liberty as economic power translated into political power.

The American Revolution is an example of how reciprocities of consumption lead to the rise of democracy - it led the revolution into force.

![[Pasted image 20231026132742.png]]

... the author continues to discuss this.

The rise of democracy was bound to industrial capitalism's dependency on the masses and their contribution to the prosperity necessitated by the new organization of production.

The 'dynamic positive feedback' between inclusive economic institutions and political institutions was vital for democracy - reciprocities in employment produces reciprocities in politics.

### 3. The New Collectivism and Its Matters of Radical Indifference

314-315

This accumulation of freedom and knowledge with the lack of organic reciprocities shapes a third feature of surveillance capitalism - a collectivist orientation that diverges from the long-standing values of market capitalism and market democracy - aiming us towards the hive collective, a new form of collectivism in which it is the market, not the state, which concentrates knowledge and freedom in its domain.

Neo liberalist ideologically succeeded in redefining the modern democratic state as a fresh source of collectivism to be resisted by any and all means.

The convergence of freedom and knowledge transforms surveillance capitalism into society's self-appointed masters: a priesthood of "tuners" rules the connected hive, cultivating it as a source of continuous raw material supply.

Radical indifference is a response to economic imperatives and therein we catch an obstructed view of its strict application as a managerial discipline.

The author talks about a Buzzfeed 2016 internal memo wherein they argue "all the work we do in growth is justified" as it helps connect people.

Bosworth makes it clear that from the viewpoint of radical indifference the positives and negatives must be viewed as equivalent despite their moral meanings and consequences.

As long as content contributes to growth tactics, Facebook wins - systematic disinformation, fraud, violence and so on.

316

The greatest challenge to this indifference comes from Facebook and Google's plans to supplant journalism - these reciprocities are erased. An example was Facebook's decision to standardise the News Feed content so all news stories looked exactly the same as each other.

Fake news and other forms of information have been central features of Google and Facebook's online environments - there are countless disinformation that survived because it fulfilled economic imperatives...

317

The guiding principles of radical indifference are reflected in the operations of Facebook's hidden low-wage labour force charged with limiting the perversion of the first text - 'content moderation', the daily banalities of these rationalized work flows where the world's horrors and hate are assigned to life and death at a pace and high volume.

This secret workforce operates at a distance, using human judgment and machine learning tools. This approach allows them to further their tendency to targeted advertising.

318

Customers forfeited those established reciprocities in favour of the "auto magic" of Google's algorithms trained on behavioural surplus culled from unwitting users. It was the radical indifference of click metrics that bred online displays of extremism and sensationalism in the first place.

The author describes several instances by Facebook and Google who choose to not fight fake news.

319

Radical indifference means that it doesn't matter what is in the pipelines as long as they are full and flowing.

Beyond these explanations is a deeper fact: radical indifference is a permanent invitation to the corruption of the first text, sustaining the division of learning in society by forfeiting the integrity of public knowledge. This is one void that surveillance capitalists will not fill as it would violate their own accumulation.

### 4. What is Surveillance Capitalism?

319-320

Surveillance capitalism must be reckoned with as a profoundly antidemocratic social force.

It is best described as a market-driven coup from above: a *coup de gens*, an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other. This coup achieves concentration of knowledge that sustain privileged influence over the division of learning in society: the privatization of the central principle of social ordering in the twenty-first century.

In a surreal paradox, this coup is celebrated as 'personalization' although it defiles, ignores, overrides, and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.

Tyranny is not a light word - it is the obliteration of politics, founded on its own strain of radical indifference in which every person, except the tyrant, is understood as an organisms among organisms in a equivalency of Other-ones ... a perversion of egalitarianism because it treats all others as equally insignificant.

Surveillance capitalisms rules by instrumentarian power through its materialization in Big Other. It assumes human shape and all that is needed can be found in their messages and emoticons, acting on behalf of an assembly of commercial operations that modify human behaviour.

It is a boundary-less form that ignores older distinctions between market and society, market and world, or market and person - a profit-seeking form in which production is subordinated to extraction as surveillance capitalists claim control over human, societal and political territories. It annexes the human experience to the market dynamic so it can be reborn as behaviour: the fourth 'fictional commodity' - land, labour and money and now behaviour.

321

Beginning of a new arc - information civilization, dominating human nature. The focus has shifted from machines that overcome the limits of bodies to machines that modify the behaviour of individuals, groups and populations.

This is a bloodless coup and threatens other delicate systems in society.

### 5. Surveillance Capitalism and Democracy

There can be no law to protect us from the unprecedented and democratic societies are vulnerable to unprecedented power - the drift towards the softening of public attitudes towards the necessity and inviolability of democracy itself.

Scholars point to a deconsolidation or a global democratic recession of Western democracies that were long considered impervious to antidemocratic threats.

The author outlines reactions to democracy.

Many have concluded from this turmoil that market democracy is no longer viable despite the fact that the combination of markets and democracy has served humanity well, lifting mankind from years of ignorance, poverty and pain. For some, it is the markets that must go. For others, it is democracy that's slated for obsolescence. Some propose economic alternatives, predict decline, favour authoritarian politics and so on.

People cannot live without the possibility of homecoming - [[Arendt and the The Human Condition|Arendt]] argues that it was the individual's experience of insignificance, expendability, political isolation and loneliness that stoked this fire. Such ideologies appear as a support in a world where nobody is reliable. [[Theodor Adorno]] attribute the success of Fascism tot he ways in which quest for effective life had become too much of a burden on most people.

Should we grow wary and surrender to the Big Other, we will trade a future of homecoming to tyranny.

323

### Be the Friction

The critical role of public opinion explains why even the most destructive ages do not last forever - capitalism is out of gear.

Capitalism has survived the longue duree less because of capability but because of its plasticity - thriving by renewing its roots in the social, finding new ways to generate wealth. Its evolution has been marked by a convergence of basic principles - private property, for instance.

I tell them that "friend" are met "face-to-face" and "heart-to-heart" and "search has meant a daring existential journey" and so on.

Capitalism instructs us in the value of our moral and political achievements by threatening to destroy them. It reminds us that shared trust is the real protection from uncertainty. It demonstrates that power untamed can lead to exile and despair. Friedman's cycle of public opinion is now up to us.
