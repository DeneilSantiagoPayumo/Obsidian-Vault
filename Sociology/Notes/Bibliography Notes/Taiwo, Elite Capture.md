AIM:
- To clarify the nature of identity politics and its relationship to individuals
- Materialist and narrative approach
- Power of 'elite capture' that stifles the latent in identity politics
- Construct a new politics together

TWO CLAIMS:
- "Elite capture deals with the unequal access to power across much of society and consequently the inability to redistribute this power and these resources appropriately ... a specific moment meant to illustrate how “political projects can be hijacked—in principle or in effect—by the well positioned and better resourced".
- Critique of deference politics (listen to the most marginalized!), has been captured by elites to become destructively passive. This deferential strategy allows for the redistribution of short-term attention, passing the microphone to the person of colour in the room, masking the power relations behind it.

- Deference politics absolves its adherents of responsibility, leading o it becoming symbolic or rebranding (not replacing) institutions.
- Examples used: brutal tactics employed by police against BLM protestors contrasted with "Humans of CIA" recruitment ads, Nancy Pelosi kneeling draped in Ghanaian *kente* designs, clothing the action of brutality with progressive reality.

- Uncritical support for political figures
- Political projects hijacked
- Threaten a group's value structure and incentives
- Analogy of games - decisions

## Identity Politics and Elite Capture ( https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/olufemi-o-taiwo-identity-politics-and-elite-capture/ )

"Identity politics is the victim of elite capture—deployed by political, social, and economic elites in the service of their own interests, rather than in the service of the vulnerable people they often claim to represent."

"After all, elites face a simpler version of oppression than non-elites do: whereas working-class black folk are pressed by racial slights and degradation alongside economic problems that might require “socialized medicine” to solve, elites’s economic position makes them comfortable enough to focus on their own status and cultural power—often at the expense of non-elites."

"Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor gives a telling example in her book _From BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation_ (2016). The Congressional Black Caucus’s co-sponsorship of Ronald Reagan’s 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act helped supercharge mass incarceration by establishing mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines and adding $1.7 billion toward the drug war while [welfare programs](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1984030900) were cut. This legislation solved the problem for the black elites of the CBC of how to seem involved with respect to the crack cocaine epidemic. But with the law’s passage, working-class African Americans went from dealing with one very complex problem to weathering two interlocking ones: the drug epidemic itself—unsolved by this draconian measure—and the surge of discriminatory law enforcement the legislation unleashed. In _Crack_ (2019), a history of this period, historian David Farber quotes Democratic senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s striking appraisal:"

"A key problem with elite capture is that the subgroup of people with power over and access to the resources that get used to describe, define, and create political realities—in other words, elites—are substantively different from the total set of people affected by the decisions they make. As the part of the group closest to power and resources, they are typically the part whose interests overlap with the total group’s the least. In the absence of the right kind of checks or constraints, they will capture the group’s values, forcing people to coordinate on a narrower social project than the group would if power were distributed differently. When elites run the show, the “group’s” interests get whittled down to what they have in common with those at the top."
