[[Nations and nationalism]]

1

John Plamentaz has talked "two types" of nationalism: nationalism is "primarily a cultural phenomenon". One type is "western", having emerged primarily in Western Europe, the other 'eastern.'

Both types depend on the acceptance of a common set of standards by which the state of development of a particular national culture is measured.

In the first type, the state is 'culturally equipped' to make the attempt to remove deficiencies (in respect to others), that the global standard of progress may have been set on ideas 'about man, morals and society' which were West European generally.

Britain may have been the pace makers but emerged a 'comity of nations' in Western Europe which had already learned to think of itself as ahead of all the others.

Consequentially, when nationalism emerged in the other countries of the West, there was no feeling that the nation was not culturally equipped to make the effort to reach those standards - German and Italy had the skills, and had little need to equip themselves culturally by appropriating what was deemed necessary for a consciously progressive civilisation.

2

Eastern nationalism on the other hand appeared among peoples recently drawn into a civilisation hitherto alien to them and whose ancestral cultures are not adapted to success and excellence by these cosmopolitan and increasing dominant standards.

They measured the backwardness of their nations in terms of certain global standards set by the advanced nations.

What is distinctive here is that there is an awareness that these standards have come from an alien culture, and the inherited culture of the nation did not provide the necessary adaptive leverage to enable it to reach those standards of progress.

It has been accompanied by an effort to 're-equip' the nation culturally, to transform it: not doing so my imitating the alien culture, but rather a regeneration of the national culture.

This attempt is deeply contradictory: hostile to the models it imitates, but accepts the values of the standards set by the alien culture. It has two rejections: rejection of the alien intruder who is to be imitated, and rejection of ancestral ways which are seen as obstacles to progress and yet also cherished as marks of identity.

This distinction, Plamanetaz, is important as it states with sufficient clarity the premises of what may be called the liberal-rationalist dilemma in talking about nationalist thought: seen in liberal histories of nationalism.

This historiography accepts nationalism as an integral part of the story of liberty - coeval with the birth of universal history, its development part of the story of liberty and the rise of industrialism and democracy.

Nationalism represents the attempts to actualize the universal urge for lbierty and progress, but also leads to xenophobia.

Seen as part of the story of liberty, nationalism could be defined as a rational ideological framework for the realization of rational, and highly laudable, political ends, but is always known for the birth of Nazism and Fascism.

3

People believed that nationalism and liberty could be opposed.

The distinction between these two types is an attempt to come to terms with this liberal dilemma. Kohn made a distinction between 'western' and 'non-western nationalism' and later 'good' nationalism and 'evil' nationalism, designed to explain how a liberal idea could be so distorted as to produce such grossly illiberal movements and regime.

It constructs a dichotomy between normal and special types.
Normal = classical, pure type, sharing material with European Enlightenment, creating a historical unity, giving the liberal-rationalist his paradigmatic form in which nationalism goes hand-in-hand with reason, liberty and progress.

The special type emerges under different occasions: seen as complex, impure and often deviant, a contradictory historical progress that can be 'disturbing'. 
Plamenatz believes that nationalists have not been liberals because they have been so active in conditions against liberalism when there's nothing separating the two.

Truely, the nationalist of the 'eastern' type accept the ideal of progress, striving to transform their inherited culture to make them better suited for the conditions of the modern world, meaning that archaic forms of authority are destroyed, conditions are created for the growth of a certain degree of individual initiative and choice.

All this cannot but be liberating in a fundamental historical sense.

Even when this kind of nationalism appeared in the form of revivalist movements or oppressive regimes, it still represents an urge for progress and freedom.

The liberal-rationalist saves the purity of his paradigm by designating deviant those cases which do not fit the classical form: he'd argue that one can still discern the basic historical urge to attain the classical ideals, explained by the special circumstances in which this attempt has to be made in countries where conditions are against freedom.

The deviations are to be explain sociologically, grouping and classifying the various empirical cases and constructing sociological conditions:

```ad-example
title: A sociological argument
collapse: closed

The argument starts:
1. Recognizing the world-wide sweep of 'the tidal wave of modernisation', distilling its essence in the awareness of man's capacity to contribute from industrial society
2. It would describe the erosion of the structure of traditional society and its replacement by the culture of industrial society, where the system of role relationships change to that of nationality
3. The argument would take in uneveness of industrialization, disrupting traditional society.
4. There is a common standard by which the states of advancement of different regions can be compared.
5. The uneven development creates nationalism, born when more and the less advanced populations can be easily distinguished in cultural terms.

```

Thus the liberal dilemma is circumvented by positive sociology: it is a good thing that struggles are being conducted within a framework of nationalism, the 'psychological blessings' of dignity and self-respect, of the elimination of inferior grades of citizenships.

There is the consequence that these political convulsions 'do not need to be re-imported into the developed, previously imperial, territories.' If the liberal conscience of the West adopts the right moral attitude of sympathy and non-interference, these backward nations will find their own path to independence.

The empirical relation between nationalism and illiberal regimes can e justified by a theory of the stages of development - arguing that the very special sociological circumstances in which the new nations have to struggle to modernize themselves, postponing democratic consummation of their efforts until the economic structures of their society are sufficiently industrialized.

With this, the liberal could assert that nationalism poses a trivial problem for history.

These arguments are not worth analysing: the conditions in which nationalism made its appearance, there was little scope for innovation or philosophical defence, or that it was done in a different context - for example, of 'industrialism.' 

By the time nationalism came to the scene, mankind was committed to industrial society, and a society whose productive system is based on cumulative science and technology: coming to terms with the requirements of industrial society, cultural homogeneity and its convergence with a political unit.

Nationalist thought did not need to investigate 'the general logic' on the society it was building, logic was given to it objectively. It had to confront the problem of selecting from pre-existing cultures in agrarian society some of the distinctive elements of this new homogenous national culture, using pre-existent cultures, transforming them, defining itself by folk culture.

This is not what it really does.

```ad-quote
title: Gellner
collapse: open
Nationalism is, essentially, the general imposition of a high culture on society ... the general diffusion of a school-mediated, academy-supervised idiom, codified for the requirements of reasonably precise bureaucratic and technological communication ... the establishment of an anymous, impersonal society ... held together above all by a shared culture of this kind.

```

If this new high culture is foreign, can it supersede the various folk cultures and become a new national culture? What about culture relativism?

Gellner recognises there is a problem, just not one that really matters - every national culture does manage to overcome incommensurability and relativism.

Nationalist thoughts, and its problems, can be reduced to the sociological requirements of industrial society whose universal sway provides the context for the understanding of nationalism.

It is a recourse to sociologist that the liberal-rationalist can first identify positively, then 'sympathetically' understand, the conditions of the undeveloped nation meaning that there is a historical lag, but more disturbing when its removal meaning coming to terms with a culture that is alien.

Plamenatz chides Western critics of nationalism in expressing distaste for the failings of backwards people - of exploitation.

7

The idea of nationalism being a rational and self-conscious attempt by the weak to achieve autonomy and liberty is false.

Nationalism is irrational, narrow and destructive: not authentic, a European export to the rest of the world - pernicious exports, of annihlation.

Kedourie has a big indictment of nationalism: his own brand of conservative politics, the grounds of which, could be dismissed as archaic and irrelevant, stating in the belief of the true fairness and nobility of the true principles of empire - beleiving that those who rule and those who are ruled are different species of men, believing in a style of politics where emotions are kept to a minimum.

Anthony Smith objects that Kedourie's description of the consequence of nationalism is a one-sided misrepresentation: overlooking the advantages and blessings of nationalist revival, a humanizing and civilizing influence. It is also misleading to portray nationalist politics merely as secret conspiracy and terrorism or nihilism and totalitarianism.

Anthony Smith is timid on several accounts:
He stating nationalism can be rounded out be specific theories that that can encompass particular sets of empirical cases of movements conventionally called nationalist.

The core doctrine fuses three ideals: collective self-determination of the people, the expression of national character and individuality, the vertical division of the world into unique nations contributing its special genius to the common fund of humanity.

This doctrine can be regarded as a not unreasonable application of enlightenment principles to the complexities of modern politics and societies ... constituting a necessary condition for the search for realsitic conditions of lbierty and equality

The problem of the specific or deviant cases is consigned to the domain of historically contingent, explained by suitable sociological theory.

In specifying this application of Enlightenment principles to the conditions of modern politics, the lbieral defender would play into Kedourie's hand: this specification would have to be in terms of progress, of teh spread of science and rationality, destroying the central moral claim of the 'core doctrine' of nationalism - the autonomy of national self-consciousness.

He may retort that nationalist doctrine is derived from European thought, alien to the non-European world.

9

The emphasis on history as a distinct mode of thought in which the life of the nation can be represented and experienced is also a European innovation absorbed into the intellectual life of the new nationalism - inventing a past for the nation, speaking it through a discourse: historical in its form but apologetic in its substance.

Modern European intellectual fashion not only decrees that a nation has a past, but also that it must have a future - have faith in the historical progress of man, and history won't let you down.

It goes hand in hand with an extremist style of politics, made respectable all over the world in the years following the French revolution.

The antipathy noticed in Asian and African revivals is not really a rejection: it is parcel of extremist style of politics, where the leaders of revolutions uses any means available to reach their goals.

![[Pasted image 20231016192340.png]]

Yet another element of this style of politics is the pathetic fallacy - demonstrated as false, asserting that the government is the same as the subject and is flesh of their flesh and that the aims and interests of government are the very same as those for which the governed work and struggle.

10

Nationalism sets out to assert its freedom from European domination but in the very conception of its project, it remains a prisoner of the prevalent European intellectual fashions.

This is a sort of logical implication of Kedourie's critique of the liberal doctrine of nationalism. What he does not see is the far-reaching implications of the argument that nationalist thought cannot constitute an autonomous discourse, using the argument as a convenient stick with which to beat the liberals, showing that nationalism is an inauthentic and misguided attempt to reach illusory ideals that can never be reached, its only consequence - violence, destruction and tyranny.

The liberal objects that this characterization of nationalism as something irrational is unwarranted: pointing to the specific socio-historical conditions in which these movements occur, suggesting that most of these movements occur and suggesting one should adopt a positive view as these movements more or less rational attempts made under difficult conditions to pursue the ideals of enlightement. If the conditions are right, nationalisms would succeed in finding their way towards that goal.

The Enlightenment view of rationality and progress and the historical values enshrined in that view are shared by both sides - the conservatives argue that the non-European people are culturally incapable of acquiring the values of the Enlightenment. The liberals ... assert that these irrational and regressive features are only a hangover from the past, that these countries too are involved in the historical task, that if the conditions are right, these nationalisms would succeed in striving across enlightenment. The liberal-rationalist refuses to pose the lack of autonomy of nationalist discourse as a theoretical problem.

The conservatives may argue that the non-Europeans are culturally incapable of acquiring the values of the Enlightenment. The liberals argue that these irrationality and regressive features are only a hangover from the past, that these countries are involved in the historical task of modernization - that once conditions detrimental are removed, there is no reason why they should not move to the values that make the West.

Why is it that non-European colonial countries have no historical alternative but to acquire the attributes of modernity when that very process means their subjection under a world order of which they have no control.

11

The author believes it is not possible to pose this problem in the ambit of bourgeois-rationalist thought.

The problem is of a much more general problem - the problem of the  Bourgeois-rationalist conception of knowledge ... as the moral and epistemic foundation for a framework of knowledge thought. Nationalist thought, in agreeing to be modern, accepts the claim to universality of this 'modern' framework of knowledge ... asserting the autonomous identity of a national culture ... simultaneously rejecting and accepting the dominance ... of an alien culture.

The most familiar problem for the Western anthropologist is that understanding 'irrational' and 'false' when judged in terms of Western criteria of rationality or truth. How is one to interpret the fact that large numbers of people collectively hold beliefs that are false - is it fair to designate such beliefs as false? Isn't that ethnocentric?

One tries to apply the 'principle of charity' derived from philosopher Donald Davidson which suggests that when confronted by large sets of communal beliefs that seem false, we should be charitable in our interpretation and take it as given that most beliefs are correct.

12

We should select the interpretation that maximizes the largest possible number of beliefs true. 

The pragmatic argument is that this principle makes large areas of those cultures open to interpretation in terms of the specific social circumstances in which those people live. The reason is that it is unlikely that their everyday practical acitivites will be guided by large-scale communal errors: so the principle of charity may yield satisfactory results.

We notice parallels:
Nationalism and Anthropology - liberal sentiments like charity and humanity.

The difficulty of these proposals?
Can we decide what it means to specify the social circumstances in which a community lives.
Can we identify the particular outcomes which the community desires when it engages in particular acts, judging if they are rational?

The dominant orientations reject searches for rationality or proclaiming that there can be multiple rationalities.

An influential approach is [[Concept, puzzles and theories|Functionalism]].

The second anthropological approach which denies the use for looking rational explanations of behaviour is one what claims strange behaviour should be interpret as symbolic acts, meaning sought for in terms of their place within an entire symbolic pattern. The anthropologist's task is to discover this latent structure of the symbolic order, seeing if these beliefs or actions are meaningful in relation to other beliefs or actions within that order.

13

What do rationalists have to say about functionalism and symbolism? Why do people hold beliefs that are wrong? Why might they act in this way? Can these reasons be attributed to the social circumstances in which beliefs are held and not by the functional requirements of a social system or the internal logic of the symbolic order.

There is a division: one group thinks its rational, but a different criteria of rationality may be rational to another. This is Eurocentric in belief.

Rationality is relative.

There is a strong argument of relativism that insists each culture has its own categorical scheme, but this would invalidate any attempts at cross-cultural understanding.

This argument depends on our ability to determine the cognitive boundaries of a culture - if the thought-system of a culture is diffefrent from that of others, we wouldn't have the consensus to understnad. The argument applies not only to cases of judging the cultures from the outside: if cognitive boundaries are indeterminite we can't understand if we are inside or outside a culture when we try to understand it.

A strictly relativist position would have to be based on a holistic conception of cultures that would make any kind of interpretation impossible.

Those that argued a relativist approach on cross-cultural understanding do not seem to favour so strong an interpretation of their case.

14

This would destroy any basis for a scientific understanding of society, interpret as a basis for an imaginative understanding of other cultures.

And thus we are left at a paradox:

The relativist argument originates in a critique of 'rationalist' methods of interpretation in which the attack is directed against exaggerated claims of universal validity.

The relativist accuses the rationalist of holding an essentialist view of his own culture, using his own beliefs to judge other beliefs, overlooking the fact that his own beliefs are the product of a specific socio-historical context.

On the other hand, the non-relativist argues that relativism claims a distinctive philosophical foundation, resting on an essentialist conception of cultures that militates against the validity of any attempt.

This situation is a reflection of the philosophical premises on which the debate has been conducted in Anglo-American social science.

It is an essentialism that is deep-rooted than the obvious cultural arrogance of colonial anthropology, or inept policy prescriptions of neo-Weberian modernization theory.

It is an aspect of the post-enlightenment view of the world in which the idea of rational knowledge assumes a definite form.

By extension, a notion of interests also enter the conception of new sciences of society - society must be organized around concepts such as wealth, productive efficiency, progress, defined in terms of the promotion of some social interests.

Interests are diverse and stratified in relations of power.

The sciences of society become knowledge of the self and the other.

15

Knowledge becomes the means to the domination of the world.

The notion of rationality and relativism is not a simple problem of positive science: if the question 'Are the beliefs held' are true, tthe reasonable approach would be to answer the question by reference to commonly accepted methods.

However, it is not clear that all beliefs in society will admit a meaningful scientific answer.

However, to the extent that questions of this sort are at all answerable within currently established scientific theories.

Pointing out the answers:
We are acknowledging the historicity of scientific methods themselves

(Notes from hereon out will be less detailed):

We recognise that if ethnicity or culture is irrelevant, we raise the possibility that this may not be the case in every scientific practice.

Problem - what a belief is, what the meaning is.
The question of culture is crucial.

The second way ethnicity becomes relevant concerns social structure of scientific research itself - pattern of funding, what is searched, its judgement, may be based in cultural beliefs or that of 'non-scientific culture'

16

When one raises the question if a culture is rational, it's only in rare cases that one can obtain an unambiguous answer.

Rationality is a certain way of looking at properties of nature, ordering our knowledge coherently, this is an ethic - a normative principle of a certain way of life.

Note, that the definition of scientific truth is contained in the notion of rationality as an ethic.

The epistemic privilege due to scientific truth is appropriated - essentialism. Correspondance between certain elements in Euro society attribute the quality of essences that characterize Western culture: essentialism divides up Western society into pre-scientific and scientific.

17

It is a moral privillege, positivism, utilitarianism, weberian - a progressive philosophy of life. When all these positions are chalenged, privilege (of the superiority of Euro people) becomes last bastion of global supremacy.

The scientist is always a modern, enlightened and self-conscious Western anthropologist. The objects of study are 'other' cultures always non-Western. No one has raised the possibility of a 'rational' understanding of 'us' by a member of the 'other' culture - it could be argued ... when we consider the problem of relativism, we consider the relations between cultures in the abstract and it does not matter if the subject-object relation between Western and non-Western cultures is reversed.

We won't ever have a kalabari anthropology about the white man - a relation of power.

18

The author is concerned about the interpretation to Marxist called "the national question" and the problem of nationalism in the non-European world where it has taken the form of 'the national *and* colonial question'

This question was debated in 2nd and 3rd intenational.

This emphasis of political democracy and practical problems facing the revolution led him to formulate his famous thesis on the rights of nation to self-determination.

His proposal was not directed through construction of a general theoretical paradigm for the study of nationalism ... marxists have argued the question since.

Horace B. Davis:
1. Nationalism of the Enlightenment (rational than emotional)
2. Based on culture and tradition, asserting that nation was a natural community, sacred, eternal - European in origin.

What about nationalism in non-European world?

Assertation of nationalism is a struggle against colonial exploitation.
Yet an assertion of traditional cultural values would be inconsistent with the conditions of historical progress - a real dilemma, is nationalism a rationalist, secular, modern movement, or whatever to emphasize the more distinctively national elements, irrelevant to modern conditions.

The outcome was determined - Westernizing elements.

The question was one judging its probable historical consequences.

19

Avastic nationalism cannot be condemned when it is considered part of a movement for people to regain its pride and self respect.
Aggressive nationalism is a menance and thus irrational from the point of view of humanity.

```ad-quote
title: Davis says..
Nationalism considered as the vindication of a particular culture is morally neutral; considered as a movement against national oppression; considered as the vehicle of aggression,, it is morally indefensible.

```

[[Imagined Communities|Anderson]]'s theory is unorthodox, he refuses to define a nation by a set of external and abstract criteria, asserting that the nation is "an imagined community."

This looks close to Gellner's position: "Nationalism ... invents nations where they do not exist" but Anderson marks the difference: for Gellner, "invent" means "fabrication" and "falsity", a piece of historical disingenuousness.

For Anderson, what does creation mean?

Historically, the political community of nation superseded the preceding cultural systems of religious community and dynastic realm - there occurred a fundamental change in modes of apprehending the world that made it possible to 'think' the nation.

It was print-Capitalism that brought out this change - an interaction between capitalism, print and linguistic diversity.

The innumerable and varied idiolects of pre-print Europe were now ''assembled, within definite limits, into print-languages far fewer in number."

This was crucial for the emergence of national consciousness because print-languages created "unified fields of exchange and communications" below Latin and spoken vernaculars gave a new fixity to languages, creating new kinds of "languages-of-powers."

20

Historically, three types of nationalism emerged:
1. Creole nationalism was built upon ambitions of classes whose economic interests were ranged against the metropolis, drawing upon liberal and enlightened ideas from Europe which provided ideological criticisms of imperialism and anciens regimes, but the shape of imagined communities created by "pilgrim creole functionaries and provincial creole print men." As a model for emulation, creole nationalism remained incomplete as it lacked linguistic communality and its state form was both retrograde and congruent with the arbitrary administrative boundaries of the imperial order.
2. The second model was that of the linguistic nationalism of Europe, a model of the independent national sate which henceforth became 'available for pirating'
3. The third model was provided by official nationalism, imposition of cultural homogeneity from the top.

All three forms were available to third world nationalisms in the 200th century. Creole functionaries first perceived a national meaning in the imperial administrative units, so did the Englishmen.

21

Russification programmes created a large bilingual section which could mediate linguistically between the metropolitan nation and the colonized people - Bilingualism meant access to modern Western cultures, and models of nationalism, nation-ness and nation-state produced elsewhere.

Third-world nationalisms assumed a modular character, drawing on more than a century and half of human experience.

Nationalist leaders are in a position to deploy civil and military educational systems modelled on official nationalisms: elections, party organizations and cultural celebrations.

![[Pasted image 20231016204714.png]]

Anderson's chief contribution to the Marxist debate on the national question is to pose the ideological creation of the nation as a central problem in the study of national movements, highlighting the social process of creation of modern language communities.

Anderson, instead of pursuing the political problems, makes a sociological theory:
1. There are no differences between Anderson and Gellner on 20th century nationalism
2. Both describe the characteristic of the new cultural homogeneity imposed on emerging nation (high culture, print language)
3. Where is this in the imagination and intellectual process of creation?

22

Anderson has to conclude on political pessimism: popular nationalism was mobilized after the fact and in a language of self-defence.

These were "chancellery wars" in which popular nationalism was mobilized after the fact

Marxists have found it hard to escape the liberal dilemma - adopting that of liberal methods, a resort to sociologism (fitting nationalism to sociological constraints of the modern age) or reducing the two contending trends within nationalism, one traditional and conservative, other rational progressive, invoking functionalism.

Marxist Historians in India take their cue from Marx in his 1853 article on British Rule in Indida.

History is episodic, marked by one great event, dividing historical time into past and future, tradition and modernity, stagnation and development, bad and good, despotism and liberty and so on.

23

For India, this was the advent of British Rule that ushered an era of change - destruction.

Many historians agree that the intellectual history of India was a history of the struggle between forces of reaction and progress: sociological and functional, reducing traditional-conservative and rational-modernist ideas to their social roots. At the same time, attempt to judge effectivity of these ideas against consequences - making these inquiries contradictory.

The main theoretical ground was an assessment of the nature of the relationship between culture and structure, superstructure and base.

Indian Marxists viewed evolution of Indian thought as a conflict: Westernist and traditionalist on the other.

24

Westernist thoughts leads to positive assessment of British rule and education.
Colonial subjection would never permit full-blooded bourgeois modernity but only a "weak and distorted caricature."

The argument was that while there was elements of modernity in the new cultural and intellectual movements in 19th century India, these are not meaningful unless located in their relation and to socio-economic structure of the country, to other the context of power - colonial subjection.

Sen placed the problem of Gramsci's theory of the hegemony into more: what was crucial was a fundamental class striving for class hegemony and advance of social production, cultural influence of intellectuals is reduced to an essentially abstract phenomenon.

In Bengal, middle class was not fundamental - the new middle class was a product of English education.

(Skipped a ton)

26

Formulations of problem encompasses a great deal of complexity: question of the effectiveness of thought as a vehicle of change.

27

Sociological determinist argues that conditions for emergence of nationalist ideology from a transformation of an agarian to industrial society are present universally: the specific cultural demarcation of a national identity the main point of interest.

Second, question of relation of thought to existing culture.

Third, question of implantation into new cultures of categories and frameworks of thoughts produced in other cultural context.

Fourth, when new framework is direct associated with a relation of dominance in cross-cultural context of power - if relations of dominance and subordination are perceived as existing between cultures, what are the specific ways in which frameworks of thought conceived in the context of the dominant culture.

All of the above have a bearing on another question - changing relations of power within society under colonial domination.

28

Problems of cross-cultural relativism inherit in the colonial situation, pose a problem of fundamental significance for an understanding the relationship between colonialism and nationalism, and second of the structure of domination which is built under the aegis of the post-colonial national state.

The critique of the 1970s seriously damaged the old structure of assumptions about the Indian renaissance, emphasizing the impossibility of making the distinction between progressive and conservative trends: most fundamental questions shared the same presuppositions.

29

Gramsci's conception of the state as 'coercion plus hegemony' and struggle for power as 'domination plus intellectual-moral leadership' enabled Indian critics to examine the renaissance: this domination rests on fragile foundations.

30

What is outlined: an analytical framework in which the ideological history of the Indian state can be studied, the passive revolution for example...

Nationalist texts were addressed to the people and colonial masters: both, nationalism sought to demonstrate the falsity of the colonial claim that backward people were culturally incapable of ruling themselves in the conditions of the modern world.

Nationalism denied the inferiority of the colonized people, asserting that a backward nation could modernize itself while retaining cultural identity.

Created a discourse that challenged the colonial claim to political domination, accepting the intellectual premises of modernity on which colonial domination was based.
