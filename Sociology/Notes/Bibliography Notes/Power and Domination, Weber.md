Power (Macht) is the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance regardless of the basis on which this probability rests.

Domination is the probability that a command with a given specific context will be obeyed by a given group of persons. Discipline is the probability that by virtue of habituation a command will receive prompt and automatic obedience in stereotyped forms on the part of a given group of persons.

The existence of domination turns only on the actual presence of one person successfully issuing orders to others, it does not imply either the existence of an administrative staff or of an organization.

It is uncommon to find it unrelated to one of these - a ruling organization exists insofar its members are subject to domination by virtue of the established order.

The concept of power is sociologically amorphous ... the concept must meant the probability that a command will be obeyed.
