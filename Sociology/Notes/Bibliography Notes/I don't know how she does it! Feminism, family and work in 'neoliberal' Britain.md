[[Welfare State And the Politics of Social Inclusion and Exclusion]]
Helen McCarthy

As Prime Minister, Thatcher encouraged aspiration, individualism and enterprise but envisaged no positive role for the state in helping parents reconcile the pursuit of those values with their caring responsibilities in the home - there was no substantial public investment in childcare provision on Thatcher's watch and no strengthening of maternity rights or introduction of paternity leave.

Cuts in social welfare budgets reinforced this picture of families thrown onto their own resources, translating into more demands on women's time as unpaid carers for children, elderly parents and even needy neighbours too. The ideological project of Thatcherism rested on accommodating a radical commitment to market values with socially conservative visions of the family. Women were free economic agents, but could not disavow their traditional social obligations to kin and community.

```ad-abstract
First, the chapter interrogates the concept of ‘responsibilisation’, developed by theorists of governmentality to denote the ways in which collectively shared burdens became reframed as the responsibility of private individuals under conditions of neoliberalism. The concept has been deployed recently by feminist scholars to analyse state and employer attitudes towards the problem of reconciling family life and work. But where those scholars regard responsibilisation as a distinctive element of ‘neoliberal’ times, I argue that it has a much longer history stretching back to late nineteenth century discourses of women’s paid work.

Second, the chapter shows how an ideology of personal responsibility also shaped government policy on childcare long before the 1980s. further complicating accounts of ‘neoliberalism’ centred on the late twentieth century. With the partial exception of the two world wars, publicly provided childcare was conceptualised as meeting a residual welfare need rather than being seen as a universal service for working mothers. When provision expanded substantially in the late 1990s under New Labour, the mixed economy of market, family and state solutions was preserved, while the needs of working mothers hovered only partially in view, obscured by Labour’s desire to tackle childhood inequalities and its communitarian rhetoric of ‘strong’ families. In other words, the childcare needs of working mothers were marginalised by governments throughout the post-war period, and not just by ‘neoliberal’ ones. 

Finally, the chapter argues that, amid these continuities, the late twentieth century did produce a new neoliberal subject in the figure of the stressed-out working mother, as exemplified in Kate Reddy, the heroine of Allison’s Pearson’s best-selling 2002 novel, I Don’t Know How She Does It! Locating the novel in the discourses of ‘post-feminism’ which became culturally resonant from the early 1990s, I argue that Reddyrepresents the marriage of market and maternalist values associated with neoliberalism but also points to the tensions within it. I suggest that the conflicts captured in Pearson’s novel were the object of wider critique around the turn of the millennium, but that this critique mostly took the form of individual strategies pursued by women to defend the arena of personal life from the values of the market. These strategies continue to give women a means of coping with the contradictions of responsibilised working motherhood in the twenty-first century.

### The 'responsibilisation' of the working mother

[[Zoe Young]], in her study of women managers, emphasises the high level of stress experienced by mothers negotiating flexible working patterns with their employers. The pressure to make a success of these arrangements is felt by women: firms take credit for being 'caring' employers but when these experiments fail, the failure rests with the employee who is understood to have demonstrated insufficient self-discipline, ingenuity or determination. These women share the practical and emotional burdens of organising their lives around their jobs and blame themselves when things unravel.

[[Rosalind Gill]] notes now neoliberalism forces women to 'bear full responsibility for their life biography no matter how severe the constraints upon their action' - that women must self-organise all aspect of their lives around the pursuit of highly individualised goals.

Then, the author describes Rottenburg and McRobbie who discuss how self-help guides are neoliberal manifestos that offer no critique of the inequalities women are forced to shoulder, or rather that the language of empowerment and choice has been configured as a type of faux feminism.

Let's address a historical perspective: the notion that domestic labour that makes women's sphere of activity is established. That said, a significant proportion of married women did work for wages. Much of the agitation to limit women's working hours or restrict them from 'dangerous' trades had the defence of the male breadwinner family as its objective.

Victorian working mothers found their champions in liberal feminists who spoke the language of personal responsibility and choice: they opposed any interference with the individual's economic liberty, arguing that factory legislation infantilised women and entrenched their inferior status in the labour market (in a reaction against protective legislation).

In the 1920s and 1930s, liberal feminists targeted the widespread enforcement of marriage bars across government and private industry. They did not want the government to tell them what they should do and these liberal feminists insisted that married women were far more capable than policymakers allowed. The council believed that "women of wide interests ... are able to combine marriage with a career with ease."

Although women in the Labour Party opposed the marriage bar, they too were suspicious of the implication that all that was necessary to create a playing field was the removal of artificial barriers - middle-class feminists dwelt little on domestic practicalities, presupposing that the working mother could organise childcare and housework by paying someone else to do it. Working class women had nothing in comparison.

Much of the literature on professional women's careers adopted this dual-role paradigm with its onus on personal responsibility. The author cites examples.

We might trace the genealogy of twenty-first century exhortations to women to 'lean in' in this post-war literature with its tendency to frame the problem of combining family and work as an issue of individual commitment rather than external constraint. What sets the neoliberal feminist position from these earlier liberal formulations is its attempt to collapse all distinctions between the public and private self.

### Family and market solutions to the childcare problem

During the world war, the British state took the step of subsidising local authority nurseries for use by mothers working in essential industries only for war nurseries to close and local authority retreating to their remit of offering day care only to families in difficult circumstances. You had to have a humongous problem to get your child a place.

How do we explain the resilience of privacy and parental responsibility as the values underpinning childcare policy throughout the twentieth century? 

One answer is that these values formed an intrinsic feature of Britain's liberal tradition in social policy - but the liberalness of British social policy has varied between policy areas and over time. British governments have intervened in the sphere of the family, but these measures weren't conceived as measures to help parents reconcile caring responsibilities with paid employment. Thatcher endorsed this position on spending on part-time rather than full-time places.

From the early twentieth century, feminists across the political spectrum argued for state action to aid motherhood. Helping women to reconcile family and paid work was never a priority for these organisations, but instead these organisations like the Women's Cooperative Guild wanted recognition of women's unwaged domestic labour at home.

[[Denise Riley]] suggests that feminist-maternalism arguments were in the politics of inscribing male breadwinner norm in the post-war settlement. Beveridge's system of welfare services rendered invisible the 'real needs' of mothers doing both domestic labour in the home *and* paid work outside it.

The dramatic expansion of part-time work played an important role in sustaining low levels of investment by governments. Over 2/5 of the female workforce were employed part-time. Policymakers believed that mothers working short shifts could arrange their childcare in the family or community. The smoothing of these informal care networks helped to convince policymakers that state action was unnecessary and mothers preferred family or community-based care to local authority nurseries. This preference was stated as though self-evident even though wartime experience had revealed the complexity of measuring demand for nursery places.

In the 1970s, policy makers had a harder time breaking this argument. Women were discarding the dual-role model and returned to work before their children went to school. One in four mothers re-entered the labour market within a year of giving birth (1976). A series of reports and surveys identified a growing demand for preschool provision but this did not lead to much investment. That said, helping parents to become better consumers of childcare became the centre of Conservative policy: Shelia Lawlor suggested that families should have wider opportunities to buy health care through systems of vouchers, discussed by neoliberal policy thinkers

Tony Blair's New Labour government launched a National Childcare Strategy in 1998, explaining that the strategy was necessary due to the failure of private providers to meet parental demand for high-quality and affordable childcare. 

They were willing to fund services through the flagship Sure Start program - extending maternity leave, introduce paid paternity leave or give carers a right to request flexible working hours. This was a minor element of this however, which focused later on getting parents into work with more centres offering childcare.

As many Feminists critics pointed out, New Labour was more comfortable invoking the language of 'children and families' than justifying its policies. This stance was in keeping with a long-standing tradition in British social policy to view the interests of women and families as one and the same thing. 
### Post-feminism and the neoliberal feminist subject

Post-feminism has been characterised as a new sensibility, culturally resonant in Britain which downplays the persistence of structural gender inequalities and interprets women's actions as expressive at all times of free choice - imagining a world where feminism has delivered sexual equality, allowing women to embrace behaviours and lifestyles.

This has been outlined by [[Catherine Hakim]]'s 'preference theory' - explaining enduring differences between men and women. In an era of equal opportunities and the pill, women's greater tendency to take time out from the labour market for child rearing, to work shorter hours, to cluster in lower-paid 'feminised' sectors of the economy reflected genuine preferences. A minority of women were true careerists but the rest adapted their work.

Viewed from one angle, Kate Reddy (a fictional character created by Allison Pearson who started a column on this character's stressful life as a city fund manager and mother of two children whilst trying to placate her husband) is the archetypal neoliberal subject - she takes it for granted that neither state nor employer will step in to help juggle the multiple demands on her time. She spends a large portion of her time on childcare - wider structural inequalities are effaced because Pearson gives her a working-class background similar to her own rise from comprehensive to Cambridge university. Her social mobility is a device that deflects the obvious critique - that the novel deals with privileged women and is written from inside that privilege and that Kate Reddy is somehow made to stand for all working women.

Her problems is exacerbated by her ambivalence with the choices she made regarding family and career: "Women carry the puzzle of family life in their heads, they just do." Kate herself believes that equality between the sexes could not work at all. Kate realises that equality cannot exist, quits her job and creates a small part-time job that allows her to spend more time with her children.

This is located perfectly at the neoliberal intersection of market values and social conservativism - she creates wealth in the city, is the perfect mother and wife at home, switches over. An alternative reading might frame his novel as a portrait of the working mother in crisis, the unwilling victim of a cruel neoliberal order - Kate's life is defined by absence as her life spins out of control, when the walls between the private and public collapse.

It reveals a rupture with the post-war 'dual-role' texts in its celebration of imperfection and the valorisation of women's incapacity. Instructing women to disavow perfection and develop their own strategies for coping with the rigour of family is not feminist politics, but it is possible to see how these texts may have given women permission to refuse an unattainable ideal of femininity.

We should not be too ready to assume the hegemonic power of neoliberal subjectivity in women's conception of themselves.

We can see this sceptical posture in one reader of Business and Professional Woman expressed her infuriation with the magazine's portrayal of Margaret Thatcher as an exemplary working mother - she poured scorn on 'those paragons who put the rest of us to shame', pointing out how they relied on expensive help to maintain this domestic order.

## Conclusion

This formation does not capture the situation of British women at the end of the twentieth century or the beginning of the twenty-first. Working mothers have been responsibilitised by a liberal feminism that privileged the capacity of the wage-earning woman and by maternalistic feminism that framed women's true work as the rearing of children.

When the state intervened it institutionalised women's primary status as that of home-maker and care giver, leaving wage-earning mothers marginalised and unsupported: this gendered welfare settlement unravelled as maternal employment rose, equal opportunities became enshrined in law and the ideas of Women's Liberation diffused into the wider market.

This legacy is seen in how women were encouraged to debunk the myth of perfection and refuse the feelings of guilty and inadequacy that was its inevitable product. Individual as opposed t collective strategies have limited political potential yet the contradiction of caring and providing for a family in a system that does not recognise the needs of working parents might still prove transformative.
