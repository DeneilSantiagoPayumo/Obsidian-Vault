## A collection of key ideas from the article

Before we start, we must acknowledge that this is a **unique** reading - it is a speech that Du Bois wrote. As a result, page numbers aren't there.

"The essential underlying fact, whether in slavery, serfdom or colonialism is that a foreign people control the labour of a country and the raw material of the land; and have the power to fix wages, living conditions and prices..." (2)

"India remains at the dictation of those who control foreign capital and commerce and the know-how of modern industry. She must pay prices determined in London and New York and sell for prices set in San Francisco and Paris." (2)

Two considerations make this economic imperialism in a new light which must be studied - "The enormous extent of our investment in Asia, Africa, Canada, Australia and all the Americas is not known with complete certainty, owing to the possibility of concealing legal ownership in modern civilisation. But the fact of our present control of industry, commerce and investment is too well-known for denial." (2)

Why?

"Private profit from low wages of coloured workers and low prices for priceless raw materials over the Earth." (2)

This capital flows for two results:
"The increase of military might to protect and retain this profit and suppression of domestic controls to prevent interference with this program." (3)

"Thus the certainty of the failure of socialism under the Socialist regime was strengthened by the fear that it might in some degree succeed and prevent the restoration of colonial enterprise in the world." (3)

"If the system of private profit was to be maintained and trends towards socialism curbed, then the democratic process must be limited." (3)

"We can find an exact parallel to this in the attitude of the South toward the Negro voter during Reconstruction: at first South knew Negroes were not intelligent enough for democracy; then it was afraid they might succeed so they disenfranchised lest they should succeed." (4)

In response to the Socialist experiment, "There was one way to stop this trend ... to scare the working class into hysterics; by turning their sons into a standing army to conquer the world; by burying their income into a bottomless pit of military preparedness against an enemy painted as ruthless, criminal, and greed beyond anything the world every knew." (5)

"What we ought to realize that the picture of the 200 million people of the Soviet Union which was caricatured in magazine and newspaper, in radio and on platform has no relation to the truth and that what it hides and disguises would have taken place if the Russia revolution had never occurred." (5)

"I repeat that with the fundamental problem of colonialisms Russia and Communism have nothing to do. If there had been no such country and no such doctrine there would still remain the question of who is going to control coffee, sugar, coca, copper, gold and a hundred thing which you demand and demand cheap; and if black, yellow and brown labour could be whipped or starved into furnishing this ... " (6)

"We see it all about us ... This is the urge of our endless and unsuppressible gambling we are losing our souls to gain, and back of our power to get wealth is and was colonial exploitation." (6)
