What is culture and power?

The author adopts an alternative approach using discourse analyses, viewing culture as dynamic social processes operating in contested terrains in which different voices becoming hegemonic in their interpretations of the world - cultural discourse battleground for meaning.

There are two contradictory elements - a tendency towards stabilization and continuity, and perpetual resistance and change. They have 'stabilizing properties' that are inherent in practices of social reproduction - cultural homogeneity being a result of hegemonisation.

These processes are born of social interaction, of motivation and desire - resonant with subject and collective experience. The religious domain therein bears a close relationship to that of culture.

117

Religion can be objectivated (Luckman's terminology) - becoming symbolic border guards for belonging to specific collective boundaries and cultural traditions - [[Emile Durkheim]] saw in religion the most basic socially cohesive act.

They usually have an expansionary missionary element in them. Religions usually become incorporated into hegemonic traditions of different collectivises, acquiring specific cultural signifiers which associate it with those collectivises - ideological constructions of individual identities who would not define themselves as religious.

118

Religion can be worshiped in ways where more traditional religious practices have been incorporated in, making them incorporated into national, ethnic and (119) racial political projects of belonging.

119

Luckman discussed a version of personal religion where people gathered various goods into their personal baskets, gathering different practices and beliefs.

## Secularism

One meaning of secularism is that of atheism - agnosticism. This denial or indifference rejects a construction of a separate, transcendental or sacred sphere, seeing it as irrelevant or dangerous.

This is linked to a view of the world associated with the age of enlightenment - what cannot be observed is meaningless (their beliefs).

120

There is a second meaning of secularism, basically political, concerning the principle of the separation of religion from the state: best seen in the constitution of the USA, written for a society without a hegemonic religion.

122

These definitions of secularism are historically connected - the separation of religion and the state enabling the privatization of religion in civil society, protecting religious communities from atheist secularization.


## Religion and nationalism

Modernist views of religion are as follows:
Nationalism is a modern alternative to religion, with [[Benedict Anderson]] arguing that nationalism's emotional power and willingness of people to kill and die for it is because there's no instrumentalist value of self-interest in it, but rather that it is sacred.

This is wrong:
1. It denies the implicit reliance on religion as a hegemonic cultural tradition which plays an important part even in states with secular constitutions (look at Turkey, whose population is mostly of Muslims, and the debate whether to let them into the EU.)
2. (124) When we view the states of the world as a whole, only a minority of them are actually secular - there exists an explicit secular republican ideology, reliance on Christian festivals, cases where nationalist movements relied on those as 'representing the people'

Let us remember [[Nationalist Thought And The Colonial World|Chatterjee's]] analysis: involved in the construction of post-colonial nations, the precedence of the cultural production of the nation over the political one, involving complex processes of mimicry and distancing from colonial cultures, searching for 'authenticity'

This is so as the hegemony of the modern nation-state has been limited, confined to the upper classes.

125

Later, it enabled a new generation of leadership that could use pre-modern terminology whilst developing ethnic projects. What symbolized progress before is now constructed as European cultural imperialism.

These movements tend to exclude and persecute ethnic, religious and sexual minorities.
These fundamentalist movements often have aspirations that transcend the boundaries of their nation.

## Religious Fundamentalism

There is a tendency to view these movements as pre-modern and always resisting social and political order. However, it is important to view these movements, with their heterogeneity, as political movements with a religious or ethnic imperative that seek ways to harness the modern state to the service of their creed. This creed is presented as the only true and valid form of the religion and/or ethnic culture.

127

Heterogeneity and contestation exist within the different religious traditions as well as between them.

The construction of a "strict adherence to the text" is always selective: all great religious scriptures include internal contradictions, with specific choices exercised in the interpretation of texts into daily practices.

128

Fundamentalism aligns itself with different political trends, appearing as a form of orthodoxy - maintenance of traditional values, as right-wing party beliefs, where the establishment of (let's say) an Israeli state is a positive religious act.

It is important to differentiate between fundamentalist movements of dominant majorities which look for universal domination in society and fundamentalist movements of minorities who aim to use powers and resources to promote and impose their vision within their specific constituencies.

129

It is clear to people all over the world that neither capitalism, communism nor nationalism are fulfilling their material, emotional and spiritual needs - feelings of despair and disorientation sharpening with the demise of the Soviet Union, end of the cold war intensifying this,

Fundamentalist forms of religion, with their repetitive authoritative performative version of the only 'true' version of religion are good at constructing sensory experiences - linked closely with the rise of collective identities defined by religion, seeing themselves as ways of protecting their members.

[[Manuel Castells]] argues that in times where people are not sure that they'll be able to continue to live with their families, work with stability, they will turn to 'defensive identity communities' - primordial and unchanging. Religion *is* that anchor, giving a sense of comfort, solace and empowerment to those people.

130-131

The issue of women and religion is complex: the paradox of fundamentalism is the fact that women collude, seek comfort and get empowered within the spaced allocated to them by fundamentalist movements.

In spite of the subservient space women occupy, they constitute the majority of their active members. This can be seen as linked not only to religion, but also the emotional division of labour between the genders in which women would be active in religious domains.

Being active in a religious movement allows them to have a legitimate place in a public sphere which may be otherwise blocked to them, or even subvert its purposes.

It can be less threatening but still a challenge and a space for personal accomplishments to which unskilled working-class women and frustrated middle-class women may flock to. However, the overall effect has been detrimental, limiting their roles, actively oppressing them when they step outside the limits of their roles.

The attraction of fundamentalist movements is aided by hollowing out of liberalism into neo-liberalism, weakening the appeal of it in less successful parts of the South (Michael Mann 2005). There is a sense of collective empowerment caused by the rise of claims of 'theo-democracy'.

The paradox: it allows space for only one version of the truth, seen as a grass-roots movement.
## Religion, Civil Society and the Political

One reason for its success is the fact its viewed as a neutral force - look at Israel, whose governments used to rely on religion parties as convenient coalition partners with no autonomous agenda except for getting more resources for their educational institutions.

A similar phenomenon can be seen in economic areas where international economic and international aids have been given to religious organisations by NGOs.

Part of the populist attraction is the fact that so many are engaged in and are committed to welfare services in the community. 

134

At the same time, these charity activities can be very exclusionary and directed only towards those who belong - see Mother Teresa's organisation.
## Fundamentalism, the 'clash of civilizations' and inter-religious cooperation.

135

The notion of the 'clash of civilisations' written by Samuel Huntingdon has created boundaries of belonging between people, assuming a non-overlap ignoring the synthetic nature of culture and its appropriations.

The world is dichotomized between good and evil, and who is who depends on which side you are on.

136

Inter-religious coalitions can have a super convoluted logic - Hindu fundamentalists are prepared to accept Sikhism as long as they are prepared to be their allies against 'invading Muslims.'

The dichotomy of religious versus secular is spreading even further in less formalized ways - determined by other political reasons and can create unpredictable alliances. Look at the Sudanese refugees in Britain sending their wives and children to Muslim countries like Egypt. 

137

Is this stable, or a phase in the struggle by these organizations for the domination of a civil "Big Society."

It is difficult to know if this is a reconfiguration of religious belonging as a facet of activist citizenship construction or the warning signs of fundamentalism where political-religious groups seek to widen their membership base.
## Multiculturalism and multi-faithism

Certain changes have taken place in the governmentality of difference and diversity as well as of migration in western societies.

On the one hand, there has been a growing pressure, under the notion of 'social cohesion' for immigrants and ethnic minorities to assimilate into the hegemonic majorities.

139

On the other hand, there is a growing legitimation and naturalization of segregated faith communities, faith schools and more or less successful and/or legitimate incorporation of legal pluralism.

Faith becomes legitimate naturalized signifier of difference and a separate community organization in the 'post-racist' era - Blair's suggestion that the way forward for social cohesion to organize visits to different faith schools was interesting - collective integration.

Part of the reason for the success (of political movements) has been its decentralization/privatization./removal of the state's 'bread for the poor' but this doesn't work: in India... it is clear that people want more state provisions.

Another side is the parallel rise in the persecution of religious minorities where visions of pluralism and multi-faith threaten fundamentalist visions.

140

## Religion and feminism.

Feminist movements have emerged in all major religions.

Many religious feminists use the discourse of 'religion' versus that of 'tradition' - Jewish feminists have argued that it is not that women are not allowed to lead lectures but that to do so is not allowed in mixed audiences.

This is a more serious concern, revolving around the ability of women to separate traditional religious discourses from a core religious essence in which they can participate as equals. Karen Armstrong (2009) argues that this is an impossible mission because all sacred texts are embedded in allegorical ambiguities. My argument that there was a great extent such practice may be the only way of struggling for women's equality - where therein achievements of years can be destroyed in moments within authoritarian religious environments if those are not valid / permitted.

The boundaries between politics of piety and transformation religious feminism is far from being clear. In the years, the use of headscarves have been forbidden ... wearing it is like declaring one's loyalty to one's community of belonging, as well as a way of claiming power within that community.

At the same time, in non-fundamentalist religious developments, often generic human rights and women's rights discourses prevail and women have gradually been allowed more and more access.

Another kind of feminist politics which relates to the religious sphere is the various feminist organizations that were established in different countries as well as internationally in order to fight against the effects of fundamentalist religious political movements locally and globally.

143

Under the Bash administration they suffered greatly as a result of the 'gag rule' which forbade funding to any organization which gave information about, let alone practised, abortions.

## Conclusion

Religious belongings have remained engaged as important elements of nationalist, ethnic and other political projects of belonging.

The greatest strength ... of religious movements is ... they work well on both local and global bases, individuals and communities,

# 5 The Cosmopolitan Question: Situating the Human and Human Rights

147
## Definitions of cosmopolitan
- Philosopher Diogenes, a 'citizen of the world' in contrast of the city-state. Cosmopolitan as politics as belonging / supranational polity.
- Etienne Balibar, cosmopolitanism as an ideological utopia, moral and political trajectory, cosmopolitics - refer to a cluster of political projects which one can relate to globalization, human rights, socialism
- Ulrich Beck's 'cosmopolitan manifesto' - moral political project of global citizenship enhanced by a new kind of social cohesion which should be based on the recognition that individualization, diversity and scepticism are written into  our global culture ... liberty, diversity and tolerance as cosmopolitan values.
- (148) Mica Navas 'visceral cosmopolitanism' - operating on an inarticulated emotional experiential level in which a person ... might be open to sexual as well as emotional attachments to 'the other.'
- Szersynki and Urry - 'banal globalism', a proliferation of global systems and narratives, so on and so forth...

149

That said, it is wrong to assume that cosmopolitan identities mean that individuals choose their identity out of free choice or that they stop belonging to collectivities.

A cosmopolitanism does not mean abstraction of identities and belonging, or abstraction of specific cultural contexts and resources - 'impurity' and hybridity of concrete cultural constructions, the importance of 'third space' and 'border zones.'

Who are the carriers and how are they (cosmopolian identities) located intersectionally, locally and globally? Are they in cities where traditional communites don't exist? What about their habitus?

150
## Situated Cosmopolitanisms

Ulrike Vieten explores specific cultural and philosophical traditions of the cosmopolitan and notions of 'the other' in Britain and Germany.

The context for Britain - rise and fall of the British Empire, creating a commercial cosmopolitanism.
Mica Nava on Selfridges - national boundaries and closures are obstacles to doing business.

British case was focused on domination, Germany was focused on unification and homogenization of the German people - civilized Europe as a whole, focusing on issues of national culture and faith. Cosmopolitanism is the next step to patriotism in what can be called a revolution: first the nation, then humanity as a whole.

Jansen and Horvat - cosmopolitanism of more marginalized nations who constituted parts of larger empires, Ottomans and Habsburg.

151

In this vein, cosmopolitanism is viewed as signifying the break-up of the national ranks and a sure sign of treason and disloyalty - for Yugoslavia, urban ordinary cosmopolitans this term evoked 'normality' that came to an abrupt end./

## 'Rooted' and 'rootless' cosmopolitanism

While many would see socialism and communism as belonging to the cluster of cosmopolitan political projects, cosmopolitanism, accompanied with the prefix of 'rootless', has been a derogatory swear word within communist discourse, and a euphemism for anti-Semitic disclosure directed against the Jews.

152

Stalin's party polarized the relationship between patriotism and cosmopolitanism. The carriers of 'rootless cosmopolitanism' were not just non-patriots but Jews, blamed for having no loyalty to the state.

'Rootedness' today is valued no less than in Stalin or Fichte's time - in earlier days, the discourse of 'rootless cosmopolitanism' was used as an interiorizing and exclusionary discourse, but in the post-colonial world, it has been adopted as a discourse of resistance against western hegemony, a 'McDonaldian' commercialism that homogenizes the boundaries of belonging. To 'decentre' the West, there is a perceived need to deconstruct the equation between westernization, modernization, globalization and cosmopolitan ideologies.

'Rootless cosmopolitan' is as situated as of the 'rooted variety - the latter perspective can neglect the most marginalised identities as irrelevant in this discourse.
'Banal globalism' is often embedded in suburban urban neighbourhood where the families of those cosmopolitans live and their attitudes are not that different from that of their neighbours who do not spend very much time travelling.

156

## Cosmopolitanism, human rights and the other

The central question is whether 'the other' and not just me/us, can or should belong - this concerns a question of whether belonging is a question of personal choice, and if someone who is included is even considered a human.

The author then looks at refugees, and Agamben's reflection on 'bare lives', and how refugees threaten the principle of the nation-state as the exclusive principle of sovereignty.

Cosmopolitan human right laws is differently institutionalized across the world, creating global citizenship stratification.

## The multiplex and controversial character  of the human

A "universal declaration of human rights' was produced by a multinational, multicultural team working under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt.

This declaration could be argued as the USA exporting principles of its own constitution to post-fascist Europe and the rest of the world - the declaration became a secular basis and a yardstick to assess and fight for liberty and justice all over the globe.

159

Human rights seemed to become a more and more hegemonic discourse, as politicans and lawyers have been dealing with this, incorporating it into the mainstream state as well as international legislation.

1600 - David Cameron substituted the law with a 'British specific' version of a 'Bill of Rights and Obligations' - viewing it as supranational, introducing an ethical and legal code.

Critiques come from other directions - seeing as western, legalistic, individualistic
Michael Ignatieff sees that huma rights are losing their pragmatic appeal, he warns of 'elevating the moral and metaphysical claims made on behalf of human rights' - 'human rights' being a specific form of politics with a minimalist kernel that is aimed at defending people's rights to free agency, the ability to make decisions and be protected from abuse ...

161

This equation of human rights with negative freedom goes well with neo-liberalism and the spread of the free market, reflecting that this stance 'reflects the elite basis of liberal thought in which having enough to eat is taken for granted.'

Even more controversial has been the right or duty of the UN or some states in intervening forcefully in the affairs of other states in which human rights violations take place. Here, the basis of IR as well as of the UN has been constructed as international, not transnational, and thus there has been no space for intervening in what is considered the internal affairs of other states.

162

Ignatieff argues three criteria for military interventions: systematic human rights abuses, constituting a threat to international peace, and military intervention has to stand a real chance of putting a stop to the abuses.

Also, the region in question must be of vital interest, for cultural, strategic or geopolitical reasons.

This 'humanitarian militarism' is built on the notion of universal human rights that have a higher normative value than that of state sovereignty - terrorism needs intervention, and the notion of the need to fight terrorism.

Such policies suffer shortcomings: reconstruction of the sociopolitical order and their reliance on justifying these military interventions in terms of securing the security of the West from terrorist attacks rather than bringing peace and democracy to the local populations.

## Human Security

The notion of human security reflects to the field of military security, and the UN's 'agenda for peace', reflecting the growing move by security concerns from inter-state to intra-state concerns, from national territories to ethnocized and racialized communities.

Human security, of course, has been pushed by NGOs.

164

Human security must no longer be concerned in military terms, but encompass economic development, social justice, environmental protection, democratization, disarmament and respect for human rights.

This field has incorporated it into a wider discourse which includes critiques and concerns from the field of development - the agenda of human security was seen as the 'peace dividends' of the post-Cold war era. This is why it has been marginalized as a mainstream discourse after 9/11 during the rise of the 'global war on terror', and that no major changes have materialized in most of the areas.

165

This 'human security' approach to development can be seen as a cosmopolitan moral and political project of belonging: rejecting the discourse of rights and entitlement, and focuses on the ways people positioned in all groups in society are capable of achieving a quality of life in terms of achievement and freedom, arguing resources have to value aside from promoting human functioning.

This has compatibility with cultural relativism - its main focus has been to develop a list of universal functions of human beings that are worth the most care and attention.

This link between capabilities and human security is personal.

There is however only a partial agreement as to what constitutes human security and the issues are that need to be tackled.

166

Sabina Alkire identify three categories of rights and freedoms - survival, livelihood and dignity. The definition should not be more specific - Sadako Ogata argues that human security is guaranteeing to all people the rights 'that belonging to a State implies' - whenever their right for human security is linked with their rights to a sustainable sense of home and social networks.

Brought back to the issue of collective rights - no interrogation as to how these relations of ownership between certain individuals and specific collectivises have been constructed or rather what the boundaries are for these 'imagined communities', yet civil war and ethnic strife are considered major threats to human security.

David Chandler argues that human rights discourse offers less to people than what old-fashioned international aid does: the withdrawal of UN World Food Program of aid from Afghanistan, the suspension of relief from Sierra Leone and so on.

Chandler relates 'the end of human rights' to the growing power of judicial authorities in this field. Unlike him, he sees this as part of growing hegemony of the normative discourse, seeing the spread of human rights politics as disabling rather than facilitating human agency.

Criticism of identity politics: Freeman, 'tyranny of structurelessness' - to discard normative and ethical principles for political action, give up the thrill of global citizenship that encompasses differences rather than discounts them, to go back to prioritizing national if not primordial identities.

## Contemporary global social movements
Protests, reports of police brutality, people of many countries are involved in the network and activities, perceived as all as not just being caused by one country, and not able to be solved on a national level either.

Neo-liberalism has been perceived as the underlying cause of much of these issues.

171

The virtual technology of the internet prove to be effective mobilizing tools in the organization of these new social movements. The implications of this issue concern not only who is participating but whether these can lead to any long-term alternative global or cosmopolitan community of belonging.

## Cosmopolitan Feminism

- global sisterhood

A view coloured by radicalized ethnocentrism in which western, liberalised women were them to liberate and civilize their oppressed sisters.

Front of solidarity focused around a series of UN conferences since the 1990s - a transnational coalition of feminist organisations and NGOs.

Human rights have been a rallying cry for recognition and the entitlement of people all over the world, not as citizens of specific states - they saw an inherent potential in the universal principle of the human rights discourse.

A major focus of this mobilization in recent years has been the international criminal court - it is important to point out that in all these forums Southern women's groups have probably been the most organized and powerful components of these coalitions and definitely working together with mutual respect and equality.

Also, the role of culture and tradition as legit principle to establish roles and treatment fo women.

## Conclusion
Further clarification - two elements, commitments towards human beings, respect not just other human beings but specific human beings without wishing all people to the same.

The reason for this disagreement there are two visions of non or anti racist society - universalistic, or politics of recognition should be considered the 'name of the challenge.'

The universalist position sees in the public acceptance of forms of difference a form of racialization, a reification of boundaries and discrimination. The pluralist account accuses the first of legitimizing only majoritarian discourse which has its whole host of problems.

Dichotomy of universalism / relativism, look at 'universal' - a place holder. The aim of anti-racist politics is to establish a universal that would be as inclusive as possible, knowing that this is a process and not a goal.

We cannot make a unified political order, but a transversal dialogue, bounded by common political values, informed by recognition of our differences and relationships.

The next chapter will discuss what kind of relationships should exist among different members of the collectivity.

# The Caring Question: the Emotional and the Political

### Feminist 'ethics of care'
Many would point to the contribution of female social reformers like Jane Adams and the transitional role of women as public political actors from mothers to charity organizations to public and feminist citizens, much of the literature on the 'ethics of care' refers to the work of Carol Gilligan (1982) who challenged the hegemonic model of moral development in psychology - exposing the situated knowledge from which scientific models have assumed universality. She argued that girls' experiences have been ignored in the construction the 'universalist' moral development framework that was based on observation males' moral development.

She pointed out the paradox that the very traits that traditionally defined the 'goodness' of women make them seem as morally deficient, as they seemed to be 'stuck' in the 3rd phase (out of 6) of moral development.

The sixth stage of the Kohlberg model should be seen as a male morality - guided by the justice principle: equality, universal fairness, rights, impersonal procedural rules.

This morality is associated with Gilligan - these two views of morality should be seen as complementary rather than oppositional, that mature morality is constructed around a convergence of the two, a dialogue between the rights and responsibility.

She was criticised for not being essentialist - universalizing women's sense of morality from her own situated gaze which assumes particular racial and class assumptions of a women's morality.

### Care as an alternative metaphysics

Several argues that the ethics of care as a political theory share a basic critique of common liberal discourse which includes conceptions of autonomy that find little from for dependency and vulnerability and conceptions of rationality and duty that find little room for effectivity and emotions except as natural energies to be constrained by reason.

...

182
### Care as a maternal project

183

Virginia Held transformed Gilligan's description of the differentiated moral development of boys and girls into the basis for a new feminist morality which she constructs as a binary - and superior - opposite to masculinist morality based on the liberal principle of contractual justice.

### Care as a feminist citizenship project
Care should be an essential component of citizenship - that the incorporation of care would transform the liberal democratic citizenship.

Principle of care, although universal, cannot be separated from the practices of care in a given situation.

...

### Care and care work

Some Feminist authors have discussed 'the care gap' and resulting 'global chains of care' - developing as an unintended result of the needs of the economy and technological developments, and the limited success of second-wave feminism, allowing women more access to the workplace.

However, the nature of work changed- globalized, restless capitalism has created demands for a greater availability of service-orientated workers, more work from different spatial bases - creating a commodification of care work as 'pink collar ghetto' with less attractive work conditions. There were not enough local workers attracted to these jobs, so there was a 'care drain.'

Not all labour demands can be exported.

Care work demands a specific regime of emotion.

...

187

### Care of the carers

The association of care work with traditional gendered divisions of labour highlights the fact that women as carers are not paid for their labour, preventing them from finding other channels of paid and fulfilling work, making them dependent on men. They are often paid less in relation to local scale of payments.

There is an automatic assumption that the boundaries of civil society overlap the boundaries of the nation - living in the 'homeland' territory. This mythical relationship has never been true. There were always members of the civil society who were not members of the dominant national collectivity, members of the nation who lived outside the state.

Tronto suggests citizenship of a country where the migrant care come to work as a solution to the situation of migrant domestic workers.

...

193

A neo-liberal morality of 'the selfish gene' seems to be celebrating as people cannot see relationships between engaging in the state and their own interests. Major political parties have agreed to cuts in state benefits and services, driven by feelings by entitlement from states, and the interests of those who rule states can take different forms - citizens who belong to minority groups are demanded to show loyalty and care to the state.

The most groundbreaking element in [[Imagined Communities|Anderson]]'s theory of nationalism in his book is a recognition that nationalism is not based on rationality - Anderson linked the rise of nationalism to a stage in the rise of industrialization and capitalism, seeing it as replacing religion. Most national ideologies incorporate religious belongings, but he was right to emphasize the passion which is at the heart of the nationalist sentiment where there is no actual rational reason and self-interest involved.

Anderson argues that this care is not based on any notion of self-interest, and this is where it gets its strength from - a substitute construction for 'the sacred'.

One of the factors contributing to the growing strength of religious movements is that religious movements and organizations are often the only ones who will put time, energy and funds in caring for the poor.

At the same time, there *are* secular movements concerned with war, poverty and global warming, transcending borders and boundaries.

Feminist 'ethics of care' morality does not ground its base in membership, but on transcending familial relationship into a universal principle of interpersonal relationships.

...

199

```ad-quote
title: About the Feminist project
I would argue that a feminist political project of belonging should be based on transversal 'rooting', 'shifting', 'mutual respect' and 'mutual trust' - should differentiate between care towards transversal allies and care towards the needy. It should not neglect to reflect upon relations of power not only among the participants ... but the participants and glocal carriers of power who do not share their values.

```
