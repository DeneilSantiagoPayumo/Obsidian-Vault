# Poverty talk: how people experiencing poverty deny their poverty and why they blame 'the poor'.
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Drawing on life history interviews with sixty men and women in north-east England who were caught up in ‘the low-pay, no-pay cycle’, this article describes how people living in poverty talk about poverty – in respect of themselves and others. Paradoxically, interviewees subscribed to a powerful set of ideas that denied poverty and morally condemned ‘the poor’. These findings are theorized in four ways: first, informants deployed close points of comparison that diminished a sense of relative poverty and deprivation; second, dissociation from ‘the poor’ reflects long-running stigma and shame but is given extra force by current forms of ‘scroungerphobia’; third, discourses of the ‘undeserving poor’ articulate with a more general contemporary prejudice against the working class, which fuels the impetus to dissociate from ‘the poor’ (and to disidentify with the working class); and fourth, the hegemonic orthodoxy that blames ‘the poor’ for their poverty can more easily dominate in contexts where more solidaristic forms of working-class life are in decline.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?
The aim of this paper is to give some visibility of a particularly overlooked group: those who churn between low-paid, insecure jobs and unemployment but never move far away from poverty. The second aim is to seek to understand the paradoxical ways in which people discussed about poverty and 'the poor.'

### How is the article organised?
This paper is presented in two parts. The first describes the aims, methods and key findings. The second theorizes why informants used the poverty talk.

### What are the key takeaways?
It makes four arguments:
1. The close social points of social comparison led to a diminished sense of relative deprivation and relative poverty
2. Narratives reflect the long-run shame and stigma of poverty and unemployment
3. The condemnation of the 'undeserving poor' feeds off and feeds into a more general contemporary prejudice against Britain's white working class
4. As working-class institutions have declined and working-class life has become less solidaristic, so more easily do hegemonic ideas come to dominate the poor.

## Methods and Data Sources
### How was this data collected?
This study was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, part of the Recurrent Poverty programme that aimed to investigate the dynamics of poverty over the life-course.

This study was conducted in Middlesbrough, the main side of Teesside.

Research participants were recruited from two Middlesbrough neighbourhoods - predominantly white, working-class areas with high levels of population stability. They are around 30-60 years old who had experience of the low-pay and no-pay cycle. All were occupationally working class and ethnically white.

Interviews were audio-recorded, lasted one to two hours and interviewees received twenty pounds. They wanted their voices heard. Very rarely did potential interviewees decline to answer.  The candid nature of the argument suggests a high degree of trust.

### What, if any are the pitfalls behind how the data was gathered? Does the author address this?
It was thought that this group would be hard to reach. As the author proves, that label may not be so.

### Special notes on the method chosen.
Teesside has gone rapid deindustrialisation since its industrial, post-war hey day. They have had socioeconomic consequences, persistently high rates of structural unemployment, diminishing opportunities for better quality employment and the likelihood that workers will be bounced between periods of unemployment.



## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Key findings
#### Everyday hardship and disclaiming poverty (288-289)
Typically, interviewees lived a life of financial hardship. Some informants appeared to be in deep poverty, unable to clothe or feed themselves properly. Day-to-day life was a juggling act that demanded strict routines and the 'bonding social capital' was crucial in helping these people get by.

Leisure lives were limited and focused on home-based activities. Holidays and days out were rare. The dream of having a family holiday was mentioned often.

Informants were not willing to use the language of poverty to describe these adverse circumstances.

#### 'Not poor' but 'managing': the normalization of everyday hardship
```ad-quote
title: 289
Instead, interviewees' reached for terms like 'hard up' and things 'being tight' but simultaneously emphasized their ability to 'get by' and 'cope' with limited resources. 'Managing', in particular, was a term that carried great resonanace and was frequently used as a counterpoint to 'being poor.' Thus, interviews stressed the fortitude, resourcefulness and ability of people to manage.
```

[[Skeggs]] especially writes that "working-class women are more likely to refuse victimhood, cover up injury and endure to display that they can cope' (2005: 971)

(p, two paragraphs, below, 290)
At the same time as describing difficult, sometimes traumatic, circumstances interviewees were keen to stress the normality of their lives. Characteristically, informants positioned themselves as being in the same situation as others.

The media prominence given to the national economic recession at the same time of fieldwork - and how there might be 'loads of people in the same situation' - partly explains Janice's emphasis upon the normality of her experiences in objectively unusual circumstances, as does the sense of pride she and others could take in presenting themselves as normal and managing in difficult situations.

#### 'Just buying fish cakes, fifty for £1': the 'undeserving poor'
```ad-quote
title: 291
In presenting themselves as largely unremarkable and rejecting the label of poverty, in stressing pride in coping with hardship, research participants constructed a self-identity in contrast to a (usually) nameless mass of 'Others' who were believed, variously, to be work-shy, to claim benefits illegitimately and to be unable to 'manage' and to engage in blameworthy consumption habits.
```

The dick and disabled are often included among the undeserving poor. Poverty in other people's lives were usually viewed as a consequence of individual ineptitude or moral failure. (291-292).

Arguably, adhering to high standards of household cleanliness and being able 'to make ends meet' is a marker of a good mother - [[Hamilton]] (2012) shows how the 'stigma management' of low-income mothers required coping strategies to protect social identity. It was the perceived unwillingness of mothers to make sacrifices which were the fulcrum upon which castigations of the undeserving poor often turned. (292)

In essence, this turned to things like providing healthy food for children or purchasing expensive goods for their kids.


### Explaining 'poverty talk'
To summarise: financial hardship were the conditions of life for interviewees. It is intriguing that this was doubted by people in the exact position.

#### Close points of comparison: (293-294)
Informants make context out of their own lives with the apparent success of the welfare state in eradicating poverty. If we understand that people tend to underestimate income inequality, thinking our own world as normal and unexceptional, then informants may not regard themselves as poor.

There may be a 'Middlesbrough' effect - informants were born and bred here and stayed here. These locations were very mono-cultural. Sometimes, adults asked the researcher why the study was set in their neighbourhood. Doubting the persistence in Britain of absolute poverty may help us understand the weak sense of relative deprivation.

#### The shame of poverty and welfare: attacking 'the poor'. 
There obviously is a massive shame towards being unemployed - [[Kelvin and jarett]] argue that participants experience the triple whammy of belonging to: 'the unemployed', 'the poor' and 'the welfare dependent.'

Understanding the shame of poverty requires historical backdrop. The social and political propensity to mark people out as untrustworthy has a long history. [[Morris]] argues sociological concern over the undeserving poor: in the Victorian era, labelling slum dwellers as the residuum, the dangerous classes, the improvident classes or the disreputable poor. (Damer, 1989: 17) (p, 295)

```ad-quote

In the tabloid press, scandals of welfare cheats and of the luxurious lives of families on benefits incite outrage against people in poverty and complacency about their prospects: ‘there is no real poverty, welfare cuts are justified’. Such stories sell better than would the mundane reality: the ‘past sell-by date’ food, the drudgery of minimum wage jobs, scrimping and saving for essentials, the going without family holidays. This is a dull and depressing litany, discomforting to readers. This popular media invisibility and/or distortion of the realities of poverty feeds the widespread belief that, where poverty does exist, it mustbe self-imposed.
```

```ad-quote

Thus, our informants’ denial of their own poverty and their joining in with the condemnation of ‘the undeserving poor’ reflects, in part, the long-run shame and stigma of poverty and unemployment. Historically, both conditions have always been close at hand for Middlesbrough’s working class (Bell, 1985). Pressure to dissociate from these reference groups becomes stronger in periods, as now, when ‘scroungerphobia’ is rife and in which honest portrayals of people in poverty are rarely seen.
```

#### The demonization of (and disidentification with) the working class

The attacks on the poor feed into a general prejudice against Britain's white working class.

Many politicians have proclaimed Britain to be classness or that 'we're all middle class now.' Those left behind in this vision of a classless society are deemed to possess 'negative' and 'backward' attitudes. [[Haylett]] (2001: 352) argues this process gained pace under Britain's New Labour administration which set in place 'an extensively and powerfully orchestrated culture of ideas about welfare and welfare populations.' (p, 297)

In this view, the other class has become the other. 

```ad-quote
title: 299
This demonization of the working class adds fuel to the general processes of 'class disidentification' - processes which bear clear parallels with the denial of poverty described here. The central conundrum is that that although class remains important in structuring people’s lives this is rarely recognized and nor is class an explicit aspect of people’s self-identity (Savage, 2000). Rather than an explicit, collective ‘class consciousness’, individuals are said to possess a more individualized, ‘classed consciousness’, which seeks social distinction and distance from others. 

```

In opposition to [[Mike Savage]], our respondents did not differentiate themselves from a group above them but they wanted to belong to a group of ordinary people and differentiate themselves from the bottom. They engaged in social distancing with subordinates, akin to [[Skeggs]] 's informants.

They are drawn to conjuring phantom Others. (p, 299)

#### Class decomposition, 'ruling ideas' and family respectabiltiy
Othering can be seen as a discursive practice which shape how the non-poor think and talk about and act towards 'the poor.' It's important to show through this article how the conceptions of the 'undeserving poor' are not just top-down but also shared at the bottom. Indeed, those, like our informants, churning between low-paid jobs and unemployment may well be the most infuriated by those they perceive to be ‘living it up at their expense’ on benefits. 

```ad-quote
title: Why? (300)
One way we can explain our findings is the withering away of working-class institutions and practices that have fostered a more politicized class consciousness. In a context where alternative rhetoric or discourses about poverty and its causes are not readily to hand, 'ruling ideas' take hold more easily.

Not many of these respondents undertook skilled trade apprenticeships, trade unions and more: the language of exploitation was missing. We saw therein the depletion of a Middlesbrough working class community.
