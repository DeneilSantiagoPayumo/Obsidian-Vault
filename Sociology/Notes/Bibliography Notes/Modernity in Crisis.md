Reckwitz, Andreas, and Hartmut Rosa. 2023. Modernity in Crisis. Cambridge: Polity
[[Late Modernity]]

# An interview with Martin Bauer:

Q: Both of your positions argue that a theory should be designed as historical sociology, analysing modern society within the framework of historical sociology. Is this akin to [[Max Weber]]?

A.R (Andreas Reckwitz): "When we formulate theories about modernity, we have to proceed from the fact that modernity, for its part, already has a history..."

H.R (Harmut Rosa): "In your (A.R) work, this historical dimension is more elaborately developed and more important, whereas I am, de facto, driven by a systematic interest".

"However, certain differences in our theoretical approaches arise from our respective concepts of modernity. I agree .. That it is possible to identify different phases in the history of modern societies ... However, I consider it essential not only to recognise the differences but also explain what is it that constitutes the common modernity of these phases. To this end, I have identified a principle that is universal to modernity as a whole, which I have described as a genuinely modern logic of escalation" (161-162)

Q: How analytically, should we deal with the complication of observing sociological processes?

H.R: From the outset, I have thought of acceleration as a formative process, and as one that can only be observed as such in light of historical comparison. Its core features then led me to the thesis that dynamic stabilization is what structurally defines modernity. (162)

A.R: For me, it is important to demonstrate the varying structural principles at play in different versions of modernity - that is, in bourgeois, industrial and late modernity. What these different modern eras have in common is that they have all had to negotiate the same fields of tension: the question of opening or closing contingency, the relationship between a logic of rationalization and a logic of culturalization, and the ways of dealing with progress and loss. This is typically modern. (163)

If one were to ask why the logic of singularity gained prominence in late modernity and what caused this to come about, it would be possible to identify three main factors: (163-164)
1. "The first factor is the transformation of the capitalist economy .. An immanent transformation towards a sort of cultural capitalism that follows its own logic of expansion while more and more new markets are opening.
2. The second factor is digitalization
3. The third is the sociocultural shift that contributed to the formation of a new middle class.

H.R: "My idea was that we initially encounter an epoch in which social change takes place over several generations ... Next the different generations still live in the same historical world. Next, the generations themselves become the agents of innovation, and this sets in motion a generational rate of change that roughly applies to the period that you call industrial modernity. As I understand things, what is new about late modernity is that the rate of change has accelerated yet again, and that cultural change now takes intra-generationally." (164)

H.R: "I define modernity as a formation that can only stabilize in dynamic fashion." 

A.R "I would in fact be extremely cautious with the idea that there is a single entity that could be called modernity. For some time now in sociology, talk of 'modernity' has no longer been as self-evident as it once was ... In this respect, the question of modernity should be questioned in a fundamental way whereby it should become clear that any fetishization of modernity is inexcusable. I argue in favour of using the term pragmatically, and thus I rely on a handful of selected features." (166)

Scopes of tensions:
1. Dialectic between establishing order and critic
2. Opposing tendencies between rationalization and culturalization
3. Generalization and singularization
4. Modern societies can radically standardize, rationalize and equalise but they can also be radically oriented toward what is unique or singular.

"In this regard, I adhere to a working concept of "modernity" and I see the radicality of modernity in all three of the aforementioned fields of tension." (166)

Transitions can occur gradually, it should be flexible (individuality). Noting has really changed, historians argue.

A.R: "Only with modernity did the idea emerge that society as a whole is contingent and that the social, in all its aspects, is fundamentally formable and mutable, even in need of being shaped. Only in modern societies can such things be transformed and controlled according to guidelines derived from the idea of progress ... In fact these societies were so static that Claude Levi-Strauss could only refer to them as "cold societies." The radical moment of contingency is a characteristic of modernity alone." (168)

"The leitmotif of modernity is revolution." (169)

H.R "Our analyses converge in the observation that there is escalation at both poles, both in the opening and in closing of contingency. But I think that the increase in particularization and the increase in generalization often happens at the same times. They are two sides of the same coin. Let's take gender norms as an example. As soon as they are no longer coded as binary, we are immediately confronted with social opening of contingency ... Order has to be renegotiated, agreed upon, and re-established. Gender equality in language and behaviour entails doing away with many things." (169)

Q: H.R makes a far stronger assertion that history of modernity and of modern society can be explained by dynamic stabilization, whereas A.R is reluctant to make high level claims.

A.R relies on critical analytics - dissolve the given positivities. H.R is based on the success of resonant relationships.

...

H.R: You draw a line between scientific analysis and political opinion, and you refer to the separate spheres of science and political discourse ... My analysis articulates a critique of the modern social formation... (196)

Both Reckwitz and Rosa make a case for an _empirical sociology_. Both are opposed to theoretical approaches that fail to recognize that perceptive explanatory frameworks provided by sociological analysis ‘cannot simply be deduced from general concepts’ bbut, rather, must be informed by an empirical engagement with ‘particular concrete historical phenomena’.

Both Reckwitz and Rosa make a case for a _historical sociology_. Firmly situated in Weberian thought, they are adamant that an in-depth understanding of contemporary reality requires a critical engagement with history.

Reckwitz - universalizing perspective may result in dehistoricalization (rational choice theory, practice theory).

Both Reckwitz and Rosa make a case for a _processual sociology_. They scrutinize ‘historical processes’, seeking to understand ‘the genealogy of social formations’. Rosa warns of treating ‘sociology as a mere science of order’ and, by implication, as an endeavour aimed at uncovering ‘the structural typology _Strukturtypik_ of the social’.

Drawing on the 18 axes of analysis proposed in this paper, the main insights gained from the preceding inquiry can be summarized on the basis of the following theses:

- _Thesis 1_: Theoretical research without empirical content is empty, just as empirical research without theoretical ambition is pointless.

- _Thesis 2_: Historicization is not antithetical to universalization, provided the latter is contextualized, both as a conceptual framework and as an empirical reality, by virtue of the former.

- _Thesis 3_: In any form of life, the implicit tautology of the incessant interplay between structural processes and processual structures is a precondition for the production, absorption, and circulation of social energy.

- _Thesis 4_: As purposive beings, we can develop a meaningful relationship to the world only by engaging with, acting upon, and immersing ourselves in the objective, normative, and subjective realms of our existence.

- _Thesis 5_: The sociologist’s will to live is expressed in the will to periodize: the in-depth study of society requires a critical understanding of its historicity.

- _Thesis 6_: The dialectic of _Kontingenzöffnung_ and _Kontingenzschließung_ is deeply intertwined with the dialectic of _Unverfügbarkeit_ and _Verfügbarkeit_: our lives are pervaded not only by the tension between freedom and constraint but also by the tension between indeterminacy and determinacy.

- _Thesis 7_: Insofar as large-scale historical developments are driven by ‘a dialectic without a telos’, society is a constantly shifting constellation of contingent happenings.

- _Thesis 8_: While our species-constitutive features may manifest themselves differently in different societies, the latter cannot come into existence, let alone be sustained, without the former.
    
- _Thesis 9_: Unless it commits to conducting both interdisciplinary and comparative-historical research, sociology will fail to account for the extent to which spatiotemporal hybridizations permeate all social formations.

- _Thesis 10_: The condition of modernity is marked by both historical specificities and cross-cultural commonalities.

- _Thesis 11_: Sociology needs to draw on both third-person and first-person perspectives to judge whether particular sets of practices, structures, and/or arrangements contribute to the empowerment or disempowerment of those involved in their production, reproduction, and potential transformation.

- _Thesis 12_: Critical sociology – whether it is pursued in terms of a critical analytics or a critical theory – is viable only to the degree that it succeeds in combining the first-person perspective of participants with the third-person perspective of observers.

- _Thesis 13_: The normativity of the perspective sets the parameters for the descriptibility of the object.

- _Thesis 14_: The social whole arises from, and is unsustainable without, the confluence of generative, reproductive, and transformative structures and processes.

- _Thesis 15_: There is no single overarching logic that shapes, let alone determines, all behavioural, ideological, and/or institutional modes of functioning in a given society.

- _Thesis 16_: If our immersion in the world is essentially relational and if our relationship to the world is fundamentally immersive, then _Dasein_ is possible only through the everyday experience of being-in-and-through-the-world.

- _Thesis 17_: Just as individual consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, collective consciousness is an emergent property of society.

- _Thesis 18_: The interdependence between _Gesellschaftstheorie_ and _Sozialtheorie_ emanates from the entanglement between _Gesellschaftspraxis_ and _Sozialpraxis_: we do, make, and perform individually _and_ collectively; therefore, we _are_.
