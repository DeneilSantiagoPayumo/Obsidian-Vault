# Meeting at the edge of fear: Theory on a world scale
## Article Introduction

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

```ad-abstract
Rich and sophisticated analyses of gender have been produced around the postcolonial world. But the theory in this work gets little recognition in the current global economy of knowledge. Feminist theory needs an understanding of the coloniality of gender, seeing the gender dynamic in imperialism and the significance of global processes for the meaning of gender itself. The agendas of feminist theory are being re-shaped on issues that include violence, power and the state, identity, methodology, and the land. An alternative structure of knowledge is emerging that can re-shape the global terrain of feminist theory and its connections with practice.

### 'At the imperial source': The coloniality of gender

title: About Lugone, 53-54
Lugones’ argument draws on two schools of thought. One is the Latin American school of decolonial thought which has developed a powerful critique of Eurocentrism in the culture of the region. Lugones draws particularly on the Peruvian sociologist Aníbal, which has continued to structure South American realities in the centuries since direct colonial rule was replaced by new forms of global power. The other is a long-running African discussion of indigenous knowledge and African philosophy. Some scholars, especially in the African diaspora, have argued that pre-colonial societies were not patriarchal or were not structured by gender, that feminism involves cultural colonisation, and that a distinctive African perspective on women is required. Lugones, making a sharp contrast between the colonial and the indigenous, speaks of gender as ‘a colonial imposition’ (2010: 748).

Such formulations are refreshing. They contest the mental habits that see the non-European world as the home of primitive gender dichotomy and unreconstructed patriarchy. However the empirical grounds are debatable. The benign view of indigenous society has attracted strong criticism within Africa, with other feminists challenging the factual claims, the cultural essentialism, and the implicit conservatism of the politics. It is difficult to deny the presence of gender and the existence of gender inequalities in most of the world’s regions at the time when Western colonisation began, East Asia, India, North Africa, Australia, and the Pacific among them. We have to recognise the vigour of pre-colonial gender orders, the complex structures of gender relations as theorised by Agarwal, Mernissi, Saffioti and others, and the turbulent gendered history of colonisation.

Lugones’ picture, then, is too stark; but the dynamic she has named is of great importance. It leads towards a profoundly historical concept of gender. Concrete evidence of gender divisions of labour and the cultural recognition of gender goes back to about 40,000 years ago. Human reproductive distinctions became enmeshed with social structure as anatomically modern humans spread around the planet. Plainly, gender relations have gone through many transformations in different environments in the millennia since. The idea of the coloniality of gender concerns the most recent global upheaval of power and populations, the five hundred years of European empire and the global capitalist economy.

"Concrete evidence of gender divison of labour and cultural recognition of gender goes back to about 40,000 years ago ... Human reproductive distinctions become enmeshed with social structure as anatomically modern humans spread across the planet." A new power was thus made to construct a new society. (54)

A crucial part of this was the dis-ordering of gender relations. The widespread rape of indigenous Women by the men of colonising forces both was an immediate violation of bodies, and broke down existing structures of sexuality, family and inheritance.

Populations that survived conquest might be relocated in forced migrations, and families torn apart (the taking of indigenous children continued far into the twentieth century). Structures of gender authority were always re-built, often by missionaries. Workforces for colonial industries were sometimes taken over as they stood, but often were assembled by force, expropriation of land, or economic pressure. Rulers and settlers created systems of inheritance and tried to project Their power through time. As soon as plunder turned into colonisation, then, reproductive bodies and gender relations were at the heart of the imperial project.

"In the contemporary world, direct imperial rule has been replaced by financial power, corporate investment, differential trade relations, frequent but dispersed Military interventions, development aid programmes and the multilateral state structure of the United Nations. Gender relations are embedded in, and constituted by, all of these structures." (55) 

"Violence is treated as an important part of the historical process that makes the gender order; violence is in that sense constitutive." (55-56)

"The transition to a postcolonial world involved gender dynamics as intimately as the creation of colonialism did. De-colonisation is often presented as a combat between groups of men, but women's presence in anti-colonial struggles have been shown by persistent feminist research." (56)

"In a long historical perspective, then, feminism in the colonial and postcolonial world signifies far more than ethnographic diversity to be added to Northern Gender studies. It documents a great historical transformation in the social processes through which gender is constituted. It offers a path to rethinking gender itself, on a scale commensurate with the world we live in. If one side of the coloniality of gender is the gender dynamic within imperialism and contemporary globalisation, the other side is the significance of imperialism and neoliberal globalisation, and the world they have brought into being, for the constitution of gender." (56)


### "Like bamboo shoots after a spring rain": Changing the agenda

There's a gulf between the historical experience of the two group. Four directions are needed.
1. Power and the state (how does the state affect definitions of gender and gender relations)
2. Identity (collective identity, sexuality, transforming a group into a historical subject)
3. Methodology (politics of citizen control, how are people chosen, how are interpretations collectively scrutinized and controlled)
4. Land (taking land is a central process in colonialisation, structured through relations with the land, gender relations

We need an idea of the shape that feminist knowledge on a world scale could take.

1. Pyramid model - it trickles down to the rest, this model is already implicit - scholars in the global South and move it down - it discards actual wealth of knowledge formation, it generalizes, legitimises stark inequalities
2. Mosaic epistemology - a clear alternative, separative knowledge systems sit besides each other like a mosaic, based on a specific culture or historical experience - major difficulties, reflects on essentialist treatments of culture and cultures are dynamic, cultures are not uniform
3. Solidarity-based epistemology - mutual learning on a world scale, formations of knowledge enter educational relations with each other, needing active engagement and evaluation. This is difficult, already implicit, requires a practice of seeing gender fundamentally in the perspective of coloniality, how does changing mean?

"To dramatice the issue a little, I suggest that we are moving from a Northern-centred global economy of knowledge with a pyramidal epistemology to a Southern-centred global democracy of knowledge with a solidarity-based epistemology, where theory is produced and recognised at many sites, and thus brought closer to popular struggles and everyday life."
