# The Society of Singularities - 10 Theses
## Article Introduction

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

What are the structural features of the temporally and spatially highly specific social formation that we call "Western modernity", as it has developed in Europe and North America since the 18th century?  

### What are the key takeaways?

Western modernity is not a temporally stable block but has been historically transformed itself. Modernity itself has a history, and the theory of modernity thus must develop a corresponding historical sensitivity.

This is guided by a specific vocabulary of social theory and a certain stance of the philosophy of science and social theory. In [[Practice Theory and Marxism]], the social is identified within the network of spatially spreading and temporally self-reproducing social practices, i.e. in patterns of activities carried by human bodies and artifacts - the social is continuously fabricated.

Theories of modernity cannot reflect social reality but provide specific interpretative access to the heterogeneity of the social world. They provide a conceptual framework - a conceptually sharpened synthesis.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

Ten thesis:

1. The book departs from the back assumption that in modern society ... Two leading social patterns of evaluation have been competing with one another: a social logic of the general and a social logic of the particular (or: the singular). Both are characteristic of Western modernity in all their radicalness: Being modern means to generalize to the extreme, but it also means - exactly the opposite - to singularize to the extreme (270-271) (not important).
2. Singularization processes are directed at *different* units of the social units of the social (the same applies to generalization processes), all of which are valued in their non-exchangeability and irreducible particularity. Human subjects are only one type of these five units of the social, objected to singularization: *Objects* and things are likewise singularized, they are evaluated and shaped as unique, too, be they economic goods, media formats or works of art. *Spatial units* are singularized by becoming identified *places*, instead of generalized *spaces* ... Undoubtedly, human *subjects* are also singularized ... Singularization can be directed as *collectives*. (271-272)
3. Singularization is to be understood praxeologically ... It is socially fabricated as unique ... It is only in social modes of fabrication in which an object, subject, collective, etc. Is 'made' unique and perceived as unique. (272)

```ad-example
title: 272
Four complexes of social practices play their role for this fabrication of singularities: evaluating, observing, receiving and producing. The fabrication of the particular (as well as the general) takes place in evaluative practices in which the unique is positively rewarded (for instance in art critique or in online evaluation platforms). Besides, practices of observation and perception are at work here, in which entities are interpreted as unique (which presupposes a corresponding sensitiveness, for instance a socialized aesthetic taste for the uniqueness of food or nature or a sensitiveness for the individuality of a human being). Practices of reception experience and appropriate objects, events, places etc. in the social logic of the particular (for instance in a certain style of traveling). Finally, practices of production are at work, in which entities are deliberately manufactured as particular (for instance in the creative industries).
```

4. Processes of singularization are usually closely linked to those of culturalization, while the logic of the general is often linked to a process of formal rationalization. (272)

```ad-example
title: 273
In **doing *rationality*, the units of the social world are subjected to a purposive-rational ... logic; in the mode of culturalization, on the other hand, things appear to have intrinsic value ... thus in the process of culturalization, valorization takes place ... that is, a strong sense of (intrinsic) value is ascribed to the entities.

The singular counts as valuable and, conversely, valorization and affect-intesification are primarily directed at the singular.
```

5. The mass production of the industrial economy, planning state, culture, way of life contributed to the logic of the general (p. 274).
6. Three social factors in particular have been responsible for the increase in relevance of the social logic of singularities: an economic, a technological and a socio-cultural factor.

"Industrial capitalism has more and more replaced by cognitive-cultural capitalism: a capitalism of knowledge work and cultural, 'symbolic' goods which strive for creativity, authenticity or narrative novelty ... The rapid shrinkage of Industrial workers corresponds to the triumph of post-industrial knowledge work, but also to the rise of manual services. The world of work and that of consumption are closely tied to one another: Thus, cognitive-cultural capitalism, with its goods striving for singularity and aesthetic, ethical or narrative value has a formative effect on the forms of life with their consumption patterns and on the entire culture of late modernity." (274)

"Digital technologies have given rise to the internet as a 'cultural machine' at the core of late modern technology: a sphere of uninterrupted and expansive production and reception of cultural entities ... In the online world. Here, both the role of the cultural audience and the role of the cultural producer gain formative power ... The internet constitutes itself as a sphere of a media attention economy in which, in a game of differences, the specificity of the singular profile ... alone promises public attention ... Finally, the personalization of the internet leads to users developing their singularized 'outlook' on the world, which entails the dissolution of the 'general public' of traditional mass media." (275)

"Since the 1980s, in Western societies a 'new middle class' has been on the rise, which has transformed what a middle-class way of life means: here an authenticity revolution of values has been taking place, stressing self-actualization and the quality of life (instead of a mere maternal social status) as leading values, amounting to a comprehensive singularization project of life." (275) ... "the new middle class is a product of the expansion of higher education; it is a social group with high cultural capital derived from college education ... The new middle class thus provides the main carrier of post-materialist value change, leading to a culture of 'expressive individualism' (Robert Bellah). It establishes aspirations to singularity in a middle class lifeworld, favouring aesthetic and ethical criteria of the good life - from child rearing to consumption, from housing to work ethics."

7.  Singularization processes contribute to the emergence of institutional structures ‘fitting’ to a logic of singularity. (275)

Institutional contexts in which diverse units from material goods over tourist destinations to YouTube stars are made singular and valuable. 

"Two mechanisms play a central role here: the creation of visibility and the establishment of a structure in which the scarce amount of (perceptive) attention is attributed; and the processes of valorization, i.e. the complex evaluation of entities as uniquely valuable. As to the latter, different time horizons from short-term hypes to long-term classics are possible. Singular goods regularly move on cultural markets—be they markets for the competition of cities or partnership platforms—that is to say, on markets for singular and cultural goods. Here, singularization and the economization of the social are closely intertwined. In recent sociological debates, the (‘neoliberal’) economization of the social is a popular topic, but from the perspective I develop its interlocking processes with singularization and culturalization lead to the very specific form of ‘singularity markets’, which contain a considerable affective appeal for its participants, and which at the same time bring about extreme forms of inequality." (275)

Here, the market is full of competition over enemies that claim uniqueness and gain long-term singularity capital - winners take the most!.

8. Late modern society is characterized by a class structure in which , on the one hand, the new middle class achieves a social, cultural and political key position ... And on the other hand, the traditional middle class and the new new lower class tend to be in decline ... Processes of culturalization have been taking place: a culturalization of inequality.

In late modernity, cultural capital, takes on a decisive role in distinguishing between classes. So, classes differ in the degree and form of self-culturalization (and singularization) of their lifestyles. (276)

9. In general, in late modernity processes of singularization and culturalization results in social asymmetries and polarizations. (276)

Socially recognized singularity is a scarce and contested resource. They affected singularity markets, labour markets of superstar economy, the 'interchangeable' workers, regional disparities with how places are attractive or not, cultural forms of life with valorisation and devaluation with how middle class success and failure are close to each other. (p. 276-277)

10. Finally, the simultaneity of valorisation and devaluation processes has its effects in the political sphere. (277)

For example: late modern liberalism breaks up the conception of a 'society of equals', "new liberalism sees itself challenged by populism focused on cultural devaluation experiences and fear of social decline, relying on collective identity of national communities. It also leads to a crisis of the general - the struggle for recognition in view of status differences, concerns an everyday culture, which is orientated towards the values of individual self-actualization and individual authenticity." (277)

"Finally, it concerns a sphere of the political in which the general public is in the process of dissolving itself in favour of partial publics. Some contemporary political movements are attempting to redefine the ‘general’ or the universal and make it a political issue (unconditional basic income, universal concern through climate change, infrastructure policy, ‘common ground’ of culture, etc.). However, the mechanisms of the society of singularities on an economic, technological, and socio-cultural level do not seem to be shaken by this—at least for the time being." (277)

Summarised:

Today's society revolves around the particular, not the general. We care more about the uniqueness of a place, its authentic nature, exceptional landscape and no longer its genericness.

Every school wants to be different, to cultivate its own profile, to have its own spirit - to be completely singular.

This moves onto politics - particularistic and temporary forms of sociality that are not universally identical but claim to be unique. Formal organisations lose their appeal, and move into what we claim to be unique. It is in the sense of neo-collectives, regional imagined communities.

## The Social Logic of Singularization

Rationalization of classic modernity attempts to foster a social logic of generality - all potential elements of the world are adapted or instances of generally valid patterns.

Singularities:
1. Must be evaluated as something particular: unique, incomparable, and non interchangeable, making reference to a certain quality and cannot be reduced to quantitative properties. They are distinct.
2. Singularities emerge in the form of different entities and elements: identified on the realm of spatial and temporal entities: places (non-interchangeable, non-comparable locations). (p, 144)
3. Are culturally valued, an end of itself, cultural sense of the term, invoking a certain performance. (p, 145)
4. Are associated with strong affects, resulting in fascination, arousal and enthusiasm and quiet satisfaction. (p, 145)
5. Distinguishable from idiosyncrasies - unique traits that come about unintentionally and are often disregarded, whereas singularities are socially and culturally fabricated: made, shaped and encouraged. Singularities are processes of singularization, singularized through practices of making, observing, valorisation, perceiving. (145-146)

title: 147, on singularities and culture
We thus can see to what extent singularization and culturalization are related. Singularities are cultural in this robust sense of the word, laying claim to an intrinsic cultural value: the event and ritual, the specific location of a city or landscape, the singular object (be it work of art or of design), the individuality of the subject, the project, the scene, or the post-traditional community – these are not primarily purposive-rational institutions, rather to them an intrinsic value is ascribed. My principle argument is that following certain historical precedents that emerged from the end of the eighteenth century onwards, in late modernity the social logic of cultural singularities has spread both quantitatively and qualitatively. The social logic of singularities implies that at the center of society processes are taking place in which objects, subjects, collectives, locations, and temporal episodes are seen, evaluated, produced, and adapted as singularities, i.e. are singularized. All the examples that I cited at the beginning of the article are instances not just of the societal force of singularities but also of a process of culturalization.

## Structures of Late Modern Society of Singularities
1. Closely connected to the digital world, the global cultural creative complex
2. Valued for their singularity, their authenticity
3. Seeks to fabricate new singularities, based on a regime of innovation
4. Negotiated in a social constellation made up of creators and an audience
5. Presented in a constellation of competition for attention in a hypercompetitive market of visibilities
6. New forms of purposive rationality are emerging that are adapted to the interchange of cultural singularities

Singularity markets: what appear to be minimal differences are perceived as absolute, qualitative, emotionally distinct differences. Winner takes all.

This singularity is made prominent through the profile - how they compete for a *compository singularity* where the subject becomes singular, and singularity becomes curated The authenticity is now a form of performative authenticity.

Two factors among singularities (the barriers of high and popular culture being eroded, leading to a de jure equality between singularities): first, antithetical processes of valorisation and devaluation that affect cultural elements and self-reinforcing effects of the inequalities mentioned above.

The flip side is of re-singularization, something perceived as conformist and mainstream appearing singular.

```ad-error
title: 153
In fact, this shift from achievement-based to success-based criteria can by and large be explained in terms of the late modern structural transformation from industrial societies and their logic of generality to post-industrial societies and their logic of cultural singularity. In rationalistically organized modernity, gradual differences in objective achievement, especially in the professional world, lead to gradual differences in status. Yet, an economy that rewards absolute differences in exceptional singularity, visibility, and the successful accumulation of attention (regardless by what means) tends in fact to legitimize far more drastic social inequalities. These asymmetries in inequality affect products, companies, locations, and subjects alike. While achievement was defined by the fulfillment of general standards of better/worse or more/less, success results precisely from the seemingly non-rational properties of the singular performance that prevail on the attention market: the particular brand name, the particular location, the particular individual.

In contrast to organized modernity, the society of singularities gives thus rise to a new range of societal problems. The society of cultural singularities does not in any way imply that the classic modern realm of necessity has been replaced by a post-modern realm of liberty, free of cultural expediency. Instead, the societal preference for the unique is associated with a devaluation of the general, which yields, in turn, new problems: not least of which are problems of equality.
