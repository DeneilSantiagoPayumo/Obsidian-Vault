# Coloniality and modernity, rationality
## Article Introduction

A relation of direct, political, social and cultural domination was established by the Europeans over the conquered of all continents - a specific Eurocenter colonialisation. The exploited and the dominated of Latin America and Africa are the main victims.

This specific colonial structure of power produced the specific social discrimination later to be codified as 'racial', 'ethnic', 'anthropological' or 'national.'

"In the beginning colonialism was a product of a systematic repression, not only of the specific beliefs, ideas, images, symbols or knowledge that were not useful to global colonial domination, while at the same time the colonizers were expropriating from the colonized their knowledge, specially in mining, agriculture, engineering as well as their products and work ... It was followed by the imposition of the use of the rulers' own patterns of expression and of their beliefs and images with reference to the supernatural ... A very efficient means of social and cultural control."  (169)

Colonizers imported a mystified image of their patterns of producing knowledge - first placing these patterns out of the reach of the dominated then teaching them in a partial and selective way. Then, European culture was made seductive and cultural Europeanisation was transformed into an aspiration.

In Asia and in the Middle East, the high cultures could never be destroyed with such intensity and profundity - placing themselves in a subordinate relation through the European view and of its own bearers. "What the Europeans did was to deprive Africans of legitimacy and recognition in the global cultural order dominated by European patterns. The former was confined to the category of the 'exotic'." (171)

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### 'Race' and coloniality of power (171)

Coloniality of power was conceived of with America and Western European with the social category of 'race' as a key element of the experiences of colonized and colonizer.

New ideas were made - white, Indians, Negroes, yellows, olives - physiognomic traits of the people as external manifestations of their 'racial' nature. Then, new geocultural identities were produced: European, American, Asiatic, African, and much later, Oceania.

The distribution of work of the capitalist system followed the same racial lines.

Probably it is not accidental that knowledge was considered then in the same way as property as a relation between one individual and something else. The same mental mechanism underlies both ideas at the point when modern society was emerging. Nevertheless, property, like knowledge, is a relation between people for the purpose of something, not a relation between an individual and something. These phenomena differ in that the property relation exists in a material as well as in an intersubjective manner; knowledge, on the other hand, only as an intersubjective relationship. It seems, then, that one can demonstrate the association between individualism/dualism and the European social and cultural conflicts at the time when the main European paradigm of rationality was elaborated. But inthat individualism/dualism there is another component, the explanation of which is not exhausted in the internal context of Europe: the ‘other’ is totally absent; or is present, can be present, only in an ‘objectivised’ mode. The radical absence of the ‘other’ not only postulates an atomistic image ofsocial existence in general; that is, it denies the idea of the social totality. As European colonial practice was to show, the paradigm also made it possible to omit every reference to any other ‘subject’ outside the European context, i.e.,to make invisible the colonial order as totality, at the same moment as the very idea of Europe was establishing itself precisely in relation to the rest of the world being colonized

In this way, finally, the ideas of totality, which elaborated an image of society as a closed structure articulated in a hierarchic order with functional relations between its parts, presupposed a unique historical logic to the historical totality, and a rationality consisting in the subjection of every part to that unique total logic. This leads to conceiving society as a macro-historical subject, endowed with a historical rationality, with a lawfulness that permits predictions of the behavior of the whole and of all its part, as well as the direction and the finality of its development in time. The ruling part of the totality incarnated, in some way, that historical logic, with respect to thecolonial worlds i.e. Europe. Not surprisingly then, history was conceived as an evolutionary continuum from the primitive to the civilized; from the traditional to the modern; from the savage to the rational; from pro-capitalism to capitalism, etc. And Europe thought of itself as the mirror of the future ofall the other societies and cultures; as the advanced form of the history of theentire species. What does not cease to surprise, however, is that Europe succeeded in imposing that ‘mirage’ upon the practical totality of the cultures that it colonized; and, much more, that this chimera is still so attractive to so many.

Outside the ‘West’, virtually in all known cultures, every cosmic vision, every image, all systematic production of knowledge is associated with a perspective of totality. But in those cultures, the perspective of totality in knowledge includes the acknowledgement of the heterogeneity of all reality; of the irreducible, contradictory character of the latter; of the legitimacy, i.e., the desirability, of the diverse character of the components of all reality and therefore, of the social. The idea of social totality, then, not only does notdeny, but depends on the historical diversity and heterogeneity of society, of every society. In other words, it not only does not deny, but it requires theidea of an ‘other’ diverse, different. That difference does not necessarilyimply the unequal nature of the ‘other’ and therefore the absolute externality of relations, nor the hierarchical inequality nor the social inferiority of theother. The differences are not necessarily the basis of domination. At the same time and because of that historical-cultural heterogeneity implies the co-presence and the articulation of diverse historical ‘logic’ around one of them, which is hegemonic but in no way unique. In this way, the road is closed to allreductionism, as well as to the metaphysics of an historical macro-subject capable of its own rationality and of historical teleology, of which individuals and specific groups, classes for instance, would hardly be carriers ormissionaries.
