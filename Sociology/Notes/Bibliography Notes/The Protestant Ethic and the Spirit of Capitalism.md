title: Criticisms of Weber
Before I begin, here are some justified criticisms of Weber. Not all theories are perfect. Use this as evaluative points.
1. Weber's characterisation of Protestantism was faulty - critiques directed to Weber's treatment of the reformation, to his interpretation of the Puritan sects in general, and to Calvinism in particular. It has been held that Weber was mistaken in introducing a concept of 'calling', and that Calvinist ethics were actually 'anti-capitalist' rather than ever sanctioning the accumulation of wealth.

2. Others have argued that Weber's exposition of Benjamin Franklin's ideas are unacceptable.

3. Weber misinterpreted Catholic doctrine - he has not studied it in any detail despite the fact that his argument is based on the basic differences between it and Protestantism. Perhaps post-medieval Catholicism involves elements favourable to the 'capitalist spirit', the reformation a reaction to such.

4. Weber's statement about capitalism is built upon unsatisfactory empirical devices - the accuracy of the figures of the study into economic activities in Baden in 1985 are questioned. Additionally, his sources are Anglo-Saxon and may be different into areas like Rhineland, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

5. Weber was not justified in drawing a contrast between modern and preceding types of capitalist activity - it has been argued, that he slanted his concept of 'modern capitalism' in a way to make it conform to elements of Puritanism he fastened upon, and that the 'spirit' of modern capitalism was indeed present in prior periods. [[Tawney]] accepts the differences between Lutheranism and the later Protestant sects, but that it is the prior development of the 'capitalist spirit' that moulded the evolution of Puritanism.

6. Weber mistakes the nature of the casual relation between Puritanism and modern capitalism - is there a relationship, would Marxists argue for a 'pluralistic' view of historical causation, treating the puritan doctrines as a document of established economic changes.

## Author Introduction

Weber will define a capitalistic economic action as one that rests on the expectation of profit by the utilization of opportunities for exchange, for a peaceful chance of profit. Acquisition by force follows its own laws and is not expedient. Where capitalistic acquisition is pursued, the next action is adjusted to calculations in terms of capital - that the action is adapted to a systematic utilization of goods or personal services as a means of acquisition in such a way therein the balance of the enterprise in money assets exceeds the capital.
For the purpose of this conception all that matters is an actual adaptation of economic action to a comparison of money income with money expenses.


The modern rational organization of the capitalistic enterprise would not have been possible without two other important factors in its development: the separation of business from the household, and closely connected to it - rational book-keeping. A spatial separation of places of work from those of residence exists elsewhere: the development of capitalistic associations with their own accounts found in the Far East, the Near East and in antiquity. This is because the indispensable requisites for this independence.

The rationality of modern western capitalism is influenced from the calculability of technical factors - dependent on peculiarities of modern science, of a calculable legal system and administration under initiative. We must consider where these laws came from.

## RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION AND SOCIAL STRATIFICATION
page 3

It is evident that the business leaders and owners of capital are overwhelmingly Protestant.
This is shown wherever capitalism has had a hand to alter the social distribution of the population in accordance with its need. This could be explained due to historical circumstance, but is unlikely - participation in economic function depends on ownership of capital and expensive education.

The emancipation from traditionalism appears to be a factor that greatly strengthens the tendency to doubt the sanctity of the religious tradition, but the reformation meant not the elimination of the Church's control over everyday life, but a substitution of control for the previous one. It meant the repudiation of a control which is very lax in favour of a regulation of the whole code of conflict.

It is well-known that the factory has taken its skill labour from young men in the handicrafts, but this is true of the Protestants than of Catholic - as though Catholics show a strong propensity to remain in their craft, whereas the Protestants are attracted to a larger extent into the factories to fill the upper ranks. The explanation is undoubtedly spiritual.

Small participation of Catholics in the modern business life of Germany is striking as it runs counter to a tendency ... national or religious minorities which are in a position of subordination to a group of rulers are likely (through voluntary or involuntary exclusion from positions of influence) to be driven with force into economic activity. The ablest members seek recognition for their abilities (look at the Poles in Russia, or the Huguenots in France) but the Protestants have a tendency to develop economic rationalism. 

The distinction that the Catholics (of France) greatly enjoy life in the upper hostile to religion whereas Protestants of Germany are absorbed in worldly but anything shows so clearly the parallel of the alleged otherworldliness of Catholicism, and the alleged materialistic joy of living of Protestantism as the vagueness of ideas.

It is remarkable how large the number of spiritual forms of piety - it is characteristic that (in the expansion of the Reformation) French Huguenot Churches monks and businessmen were among the proselytes - even the Spaniards knew that heresy (Calvinism of the Dutch) promoted trade. But not all the Protestant denominations have had a strong influence in this direction - that of Calvinism promoted the spirit of Capitalism the most, with their connection of a religious way of life with the most intensive development of business acumen.

It is necessary to think of the Rhine country and of Calw - the spirit of hard work is one inclined to ascribe to Protestantism.  The old Protestantism of Luther had little to do with progress - it was directly hostile.


## THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM

What is to be understood by the *spirit* of capitalism?
Such a historical concept as it refers in its content to a phenomenon significant for its individuality, cannot be defined according to the formula - just gradually put together out of the individual parts taken from historical reality.

If we try to determine the object, the analysis and historical explanation of which we are attempting, it cannot be in the form of a conceptual definition - only a provisional one.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] preaches us the spirit of capitalism that speaks in a characteristic fashion. Let us consider the philosophy 'they make tallow out of cattle and money out of men' - the philosophy of avarice appears to be the ideal of the honest man of recognized credit. What is preached here is not a means of making one's way in the world, but a peculiar ethic.

All of Franklin's moral attitudes are coloured with utilitarianism - honesty, assuring credit, punctuality, industry and frugality. Classic virtues. A logical deduction from this would be that the unnecessary surplus of this virtue would appear to Franklin as unproductive waste - virtues, like all others, are only in so far. In the summum bonum of this ethic, combined with the avoidance of all spontaneous enjoyment of life, is devoid of admixture: an end to itself, dominated by the making of money.

Benjamin, when asked, why should 'money be made out of men', answered in his autobiography wherein 'Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings" (Prov. xxii. 29)'

The earning of money, as long as it does legally, the result and expression of virtue and proficiency.

And in truth this idea has so little a matter of course. It is an obligation of what someone should feel - no matter in what it consists, just his material possessions.

This conception has not only appeared  under capitalistic conditions - it will suffice for our purpose to call into attention that in the country of Franklin's birth, the spirit of capitalism was present.

The spirit of capitalism had to fight its way to supremacy against a whole world of hostile forces within the ancient times, and of the Middle Ages - proscribed as the lowest sort of avarice and lacking self-respect.

This reign of absolute unscrupulousness in the pursuit of selfish interests. As every employer knows, the lack of conscience of the labourers is one of the main obstacles to capitalistic development. Capitalism cannot make use of the labour who practice the doctrine of undisciplined *liberum arbitrium* any more than it can make use of the business man who seems absolutely unscrupulous in his dealings with others. The difference does not lie in the degree of development of any impulse to make money - this story is as old as man, but those who submitted to it without reserve 'as an uncontrolled impulse' were not representatives of that attitude of mind from which the capitalistic spirit was born.

Capitalistic acquisition as an adventure has been at home in all types of economic society which have known trade with the use of money through farming of taxes, state loans, financing of wars, office holders.

The most important opponent with the spirit of Capitalism has had to struggle was traditionalism - the type of attitude and reaction to new situations. One of the technical means which the modern employer uses to secure the greatest possible amount of work from his men is the use of piece-rates.

```ad-example
title: Agriculture
For instance, with the weather being uncertain, the difference between high profit and loss depends on the speed of work.
Therefore, by increasing the piece-rates of the workmen, you interest them in increasing their own efficiency.

In this scenario, raising the piece-rate has led to less being accomplished tless farming. The opportunity of earning more was less attractive than that of working less. 
```

This is traditionalism at its core - a man does not 'by nature' wish to earn more money, but live as he is accustomed to live.

Another possibility is to try and force the worker to work harder to earn the same amount. Low wages means high profit after all. But there is limits to this idea: too large an army may limit its qualitative development, with a physiologically insufficient wage the efficiency of labour decreases. Low wages fail even from a purely business point of view when producing goods that require skilled labour, or the use of expensive machinery, or when sharp attention or initiative is required. Therefore, a change of attitude is needed.

For example in German unmarried girl, there's an indication that they are unwilling to give up methods of work to adapt to new methods in favour of new ones. The ability of mental concentration and obligation to one's job (given that the best chance of economic education are found among this group) combined with a strict economy, self-control and high earnings improves performance. 

The observation of present-day capitalism suggests how this connection of adaptability may even come about... but they were present in the early development of Capitalism, from the dislike Methodist workmen met at the hands of their comrades.

Enterprises are carried on by private entrepreneurs by utilising capital to make a profit, purchasing the means of production and selling the product - the rule to be sure, the capitalistic form of an enterprise and the spirit is run generally stand in some sort of adequate relationship. Nevertheless, the spirit of capitalism is **the attitude which seeks profit rationally and systematically**. This is justified by the historical fact that attitude has on the one hand.

That said, Franklin was filled with the spirit of Capitalism when his printing business did not differ in form from any handicraft enterprise. We shall see at the beginning of the modern times it was not capitalistic entrepreneurs of the commercial aristocracy, but the rising strata of the lower industrial middle classes - the self-made parvenus of Manchester and Westphalia who rose from modest circumstances - the revolution making an end of old traditionalism

```ad-example
title: The life of a putter
collapse: open
Until about the middle of the pat century, the life of a putter-out was very comfortable.
Peasants came with cloths, entirely made from raw materials.
Their customers were middle-men who bought them back to their warehouse.
Correspondence sufficed.
The number of business hours was very moderate.
Relations among conmpetitors were good, with a large degree of agreement among the fundamentals of business.
This form of organization was in every respect capitalistic. The book-keeping was rational. But it was traditionalistic business, if one considers the spirit that animates the entrepreneur.

When this leisureliness was destroyed, what happened was this: young men of putter families went out into the country, chose weavers, increased the rigour of their work and turned them into labourers - changing their marketing by going to the final consumer. The idyllic state collapsed under the pressure of a bitter struggle where respectable fortunes were made to be put in the business. It was not a stream of money that brought this revolution but the new spirit of capitalism.

```

The question of the motive forces in the expansion of modern capitalism is not in the first instance a question of the origin of the capital sums, and the development of the spirit of capitalism. Where it appears, it produces its own capital and monetary supplies but the reverse is not always true: a flood of mistrust, hatred, it was easy not to recognise that only a strong character could save people. It is by virtue and clarity that it is possible for people to command the confidence of his customers and workmen.

These are men who grew up in the hard school of life, utterly devoted to their business.

One is tempted to think these moral qualities has no relation to ethical maxims, but the essential relation between them is negative. The ability to free oneself from the tradition seems to be the most suitable basis for such a success. Any relationship between religious beliefs and conduct is absent, and the people filled with the spirit of capitalism tend to be indifferent to the church.

Of course the desire for power plays its part - the romanticism of numbers an irresistible appeal to the poets. The ideal type of the capitalistic entrepreneur has no relation to refined climbers, avoids ostentation and unnecessary expenditure and enjoys his power - embarased by the social recognition he receives.

It is just the pre-capitalistic man, so incomprehensible, that anyone should be able to make it the sole purpose of his life-work to sink into the grave.

It is under our individualistic political, legal and economic institutions that this spirit of capitalism may be understandable as a result of adaptation - an attitude towards material goods,, so bound with the condition of survival that it does not need the support of religious forces.

Some moralists may argue that they accepted developed capitalistic business forms as inevitable and justified them as necessary - but these doctrines rejected the spirit of capitalistic acquisition and could not give it a positive ethical sanction. It was only accepted on  the danger of acollusion with the church's doctrine.

How could activity turn into a calling in the sense of Franklin? Historically, this attitude was considered ethically unjustifiable - what was the background of ideas that could account for this as a calling towards the individual feels himself to have an ethical obligation?

This attempt was made (particularly by Sombart) to depict rationalism as the salient feature of modern life. Now this process forms a part in the ideals of modern bourgeois society - labour in the service of a rational organization for the provision of humanity. 

This development of the spirit of Capitalism is considered in part of a development of rationalism as a whole and could be deduced from the fundamental position of rationalism on the basic problems of life - the but any attempt to carry this thesis through makes it evident that such a simple way of putting the question will not work as it does not follow parallel.

The rationalization of private law was achieved in the highest hitherto degree in the Roman law of late antiquity. It remained backwards and did not favour alone countries of high capitalistic development. This is by no means the relationship of a man to his calling as a task has grown - these rationalize life from different point of views and directions. Rationalism is a historical concept that covers a whole world of different things.
