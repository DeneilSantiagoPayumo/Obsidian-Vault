# Colonialism, Postcolonialism and the Liberal Welfare State

## Article Introduction
### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

```ad-abstract
This article addresses the colonial and racial origins of the welfare state with a particular emphasis on the liberal welfare state of the USA and UK. Both are understood in terms of the centrality of the commodified status of labour power expressing a logic of market relations. In contrast, we argue that with a proper understanding of the relations of capitalism and colonialism, the sale of labour power as a commodity already represents a movement away from the commodified form of labour represented by enslavement. European colonialism is integral to the development of welfare states and their forms of inclusion and exclusion which remain racialised through into the twenty-first century.
```

In particular, we will set out how a deeper historical sociology of coloniality can provide a more adequate understanding of the trajectory of European and other advanced welfare states. This is a re-interpretation of the liberal welfare regime.

Our purpose is analytical as well as substantive. The liberal welfare state exemplifies a general tendency in understanding of the welfare state to separate the 'economic' from the 'social' and the 'political' and to assign to the former an impersonal logic of the market. The social is understood as the locus of 'identities' which are mobilised through the 'political' process to intervene in the 'economy' to moderate its outcomes.

Commodification is racialised - markets are racialised as a result of the commodity form, rather than despite it.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

```ad-quote
title: 579
The idea of ‘free labour’ appears to emerge as a category of disadvantaged membership in asocietal community, governed by cultural norms of proper treatment, where some are excluded from membership and made subject to unfree labour. Given the well-documented debates over the humanity (or otherwise) of native Americans and Africans in the context of Spanish colonialism (Rodriguez-Salgado 2009), as well as philosophical reflections on‘stages’of history (Bhambra 2007), and religious involvement in the anti-slavery movement (Anderson 2014), these cultural norms were religiously inflected and racially organised. It is in this sense that ‘commodified’ labour power and its separation from human individuality might be understood as a ‘moral’, rather than an‘economic’ category, deriving from a particular religious tradition and applied, in the first instance, only to those understood as members. Indeed, as far back as de Tocqueville, it was noted that, the enforcedlabour of the enslaved potentiall ‘de-legitimated’ free labour because manual labour itself was understood in racialised terms (de Tocqueville2010 [1835/40]; see also Rana 2011, Isenberg 2016). The point we wish to emphasise here is that the benchmark of commodified labour, against which degrees of de-commodification will be measured to establish ‘types of welfare state’ is already, itself,a form of de-commodification against which further de-commodification is (problematically) assessed in a way that erases the racial construction of labour. ‘Labour power as a commodity’ is a product of political economy, but not in Marx’s sense of embodying a sui generis logic of capitalism. It is a product of a political community that divides its members from others who are subject to vicious forms of domination on the basis of their exclusion from social membership.

Our point is not directed simply at the standard Marxist account, but also at how the sociological successor accounts contain the same incoherent separation of the ‘economic’ and the ‘social’ (a separation shown to be incoherent by the development of capitalism itself). The distinction operates to present the economic as representing impersonal (and rational) market processes, while the social is the source of non-rational (including discriminatory) modifications. Polanyi was not the first to see that the distinction was incoherent together with the idea of a self-sufficient logic of economic reproduction. However, in our view, he did not go far enough in repudiating the idea of labour-power as a commodity. In effect, in characterising liberalism as an incoherent theory of public policy he fails to understand it as a racialised _moral_ economy and, in consequence, contributes to the idea of its ‘impersonal’ (that is, non-racialised character). In this way, liberalism comes to be the model of relations based on equality, and deviations from equality are contingent and not intrinsic to it. Thus, from this perspective, it becomes difficult to understand the racialised character of welfare states identified as liberal precisely because the very description of commodification that defines them is represented as ‘impersonal’.

Civil rights drew its inspiration from decolonial movements - expectation that federal welfare regime would be de-segregated and modify immigration policy.

Instead, rather than extend social rights in this way, neo-liberal public policy began to remove social rights from everyone. This is associated with the Republican Party’s ‘Southern strategy’ to detach white Southern votes from the Democratic Party. Ronald Reagan’s Neshoba County Fair speech in 1980 (at the scene of a lynching of Mississippi freedom summer activists in 1964) articulates this strategy in the context of neo-liberalism: (582)

"I believe in states’ rights. I believe in people doing as much as they can for themselves at the community level and at the private level. And I believe that we’ve distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended in the Constitution to be given to that federal establishment. (582)

These words presage an attack on social rights of citizenship and the pathologising of welfare dependency within neo-liberalism, but it also continues the racialised divisions integral to liberal political communities from their earliest foundation. (582)

Paradoxically, the neo-liberal retrenchment of social rights more generally following de-segregation in the USA has had the appearance of making ‘class’ appear more relevant in the explanation of the experience of African Americans than ‘race’. This is because a significant proportion of white Americans come to share a similar experience of disadvantage. However, what needs to be understood is that it is _race_ that explains the re-emergence of ‘class’ and not _class_ which is the underlying explanation of ‘race’. It is also the context in which the ‘white’ working class emerges as racially positioned by neo-liberalism as sharing material experiences with non-white citizens, but claiming ‘whiteness’ as a marker of difference and identity. In other words, the racialised form of populism exhibited in the recent presidential election in the US (and in the referendum vote to leave the EU in the UK) is integral to the racialised structures of labour markets and welfare of liberal and neo-liberal welfare states. (582)

As we have suggested, the assignment of colonialism to the national histories of separate European countries and not to the EU and the European ‘project’ itself is a flawed construction. However, as we have seen, it is not something that enters into the accounts of the development of national welfare states of countries that were also colonial powers. We have provided one such account of the liberal welfare cluster, and we do not have the space to extend that analysis to give a similar account for the countries within other clusters. Notwithstanding, it seems straightforward that the welfare arrangements of colonial powers such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany are characterised by hierarchical arrangements of inclusion and exclusion, where rights developed in the metropole are not extended to the colonial possessions and, indeed, those possessions are understood to serve the prosperity of the metropole and its ‘local’ hierarchies.

### Conclusion

```ad-tldr
title: 584
Colonialism, whether through the establishment of formal colonies or through forms of settlement assimilating into the dominant variants of other colonial powers, is central to the historical construction of the welfare state in Europe. Without taking this broader history into account, our explanations for current issues affecting welfare states will be limited and parochial. Issues of race and immigration are not new phenomena with which European welfare states must now contend, but are longstanding issues albeit displaced and invisible as a consequence of how social scientific accounts have themselves been constructed.

We have tried to show that this is not simply a matter of substance – a failure properly to address race and immigration – it is also analytical, built into social scientific concepts. Markets are raced, once we understand that the idea of labour power as a commodity derives from moral economy and is not the asocial and pure form of the market relation. ‘Solidarities of class’ are not the antidote to racialised responses, but are themselves bound up in them. There is no automatic association of ‘class’ (or market) with the dissolution of racialised inequalities. Indeed, exclusive ‘solidarities’ have been used to represent others as undeserving and have been the basis of reducing welfare rights. ‘Class’ is not about ‘real underlying processes’, in contrast to a politics of identity that disrupts organisation on the basis of those processes. Class is race, and addressing their mutual formation will be central to any future organisation for social justice. The conjunction of neo-liberalism and populism is not accidental and, the future of inequality in the twenty-first century will be the entrenched capitalist patrimonialism that Piketty describes unless we can rise to the occasion by reconstructing our understanding of how profound inequalities have been produced and reproduced.
