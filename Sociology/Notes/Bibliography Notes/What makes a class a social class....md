# What Makes a Social Class? On The Theoretical and Practical Existence Of Groups.

## Article Introduction

This idea misleads one to believe that this problem can be reduced to a simple choice. Is class an analytical category or a folk category?

One of the main obstacles is what we make of paired concepts, "epistemological couples" made by [[Bachelard]]. The opposition between structuralism and constructivism or objectivism and subjectivism.

From subjectivism (represented by phenomenology, ethnomethodology and constructivist sociology) agents make social reality, the aggregation of these acts.

"In reality, agents are both classified and classifiers, but they classify according to ... their position within classification." (2)

A point of view is a perspective but at the same time, a perspective taken from a point within an objective social space.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The objectivist moment - from social classes to social space: Class as a well-founded theoretical construct.

Are classes a scientific construct or do they exist in reality? Do they exist or do they not?

Those who assert the existence of classes will tend to take a realist stand and will attempt to determine empirically the properties of that class. An opposition: this implication views classes as nothing but the construct of the scientist with. In reality, any attempt of trying to find an objective indicator will find discontinuities with income.

Those who claim to find 'ready-made' classes and those who believe it's all theoretical artifacts both accept a substantialist philosophy which recognizes o other reality than that which is directly given to the intuition of ordinary experience (paraphrased, 3)

"From this point, the "social reality" spoken of in objectivist sociology ... consists of a set of invisible relationships, those precisely which constitute a space of positions external to one another and defined by their relative distance to one another." (4) In this regard, what is real is rather a **social space**.

Science is to understand this social space.

In a social universe like French Society, these fundamental social powers are: (paraphrased, 4)

1. Economic capital (volume)
2. Cultural capital (composition)
3. Social capital (evolution, trajectory "Agents are assigned a position ... defined by their relative position))
4. Symbolic capital, the form that capital take once they are perceived and recognised as legitimate

This product of the relational mode of thinking will be interpreted in a realist and substantialist way - classes as logical classes are then see as real constituted groups. The more accurate the theoretical construction of theoretical classes, the greater the chance that they will be seen as real groups.

"With the set of common principles which measure the relative distance between individuals, we acquire the means of regrouping individuals into classes in such a way that agents in the same class are as similar as possible in the greatest possible number of respects and in such a way that the classes are as distinct as possible from one another." (slightly paraphrased, 5)

The means used to construct and exhibit the social space obscure it from view - the populations it is necessary in order to objectify the positions they occupy hide these very positions. Spaces are constructed in a way that the closer the individual agents in it, the greater their probable number of common properties..." (5)

The dispositions acquired in the position occupied involve an adjustment to this position - what [[Erving Goffman]]  call the "sense of one's place" - a sense of one's place in a situation of interaction, prompts those whom we call in French *les gens humbles* that keep people in their place and keep their distance. (paraphrased, 5) This follows timidity or arrogance.

```ad-summary
"To sum up so far: constructed classes can be characterized in a certain way as sets of agents who, by virtue of the fact that they occupy similar positions in social space ... are subject to similar conditions of existence and conditioning factors and, as a result, are endowed with similar dispositions which prompt them to develop similar practices." (7)

```

(7, following)

One can follow like [[Karl Marx]] does that the theoretical classes are the real ones - "real groups of individuals moved by the consciousness of their condition and interests, a consciousness which simultaneously united them and opposes them to other classes." (7)

One argues: these conditions will assert itself over time. Another may argue for an 'awakening of consciousness' or any combination of the two.

```ad-quote
"It remains nonetheless that, contrary to what Marxist theory assumes, the movement from probability to reality, from theoretical class to practical class, is never given: even though they are supported by the "sense of one's place" and by the affiniy of habitus, the principle of vision and divison of the social world at work in the construction of theoretical classes have to compete, in reality, with other principles, ethnic, racial or national, and more concretely still, with principles imposed by the ordinary experience of occupational, communal and local divisons and rivalries." (8)

```

In short:
By assuming that actions and interactions can be deduced from the structure, and keeping a sharp distinction between the logic of things and the things of logic, even those which are best adjusted to the logic of things, we can establish several positions:
1. Classes-in-struggle do not exist
2. Classes can assent to a definite form of existence only at the cost of a specific work of which the specifically theoretical of which a theoretical production of a representation of the divison is a decisive element
3. This political labour is likely to succeed when it is armed with a theory well-founded in reality

A theory of theoretical classes leads one to pose that the political work aimed at producing classes in the form of objective institutions, at once expressed and constituted by permanent organs of representation.

Groups are not ready-made in reality, they are the product of a complex work of construction.

When we speak of social classes, it exists to make us question its existence - even social scientists like Marx transformed an analytical construct to a folk category.

### The subjectivist moment - field of forces and field of struggles: the work of class-making

Collectives having an economic and social base are symbolic constructions oriented by the pursuit of individual and collective interests. The social theorist deals with an object which is itself an object, and the subject - they may be tempted to set themselves up as a referee capable of adjudicating with supreme authority between rival constructions.

This leads one to forget the criteria used in the construction oft he objective space and of the well-founded classifications it makes possible are also instruments. (all, 9)

Consider the relative value of different species of capital - stocks, bonds, IRAs, Master of Arts, or even classifications like age or sex.

Thus the "ideologies" and folk theories that the objectivist rupture had to set aside in the first place to construct the objective space of social position, must be brought back into the model of reality.

"Social reality presents itself neither as completely determined, not as completely indeterminate." (11) From a certain angle, it presents itself as strongly structured, essentially because the social space presents itself in the form of agents and institutions endowed with different properties which have very unequal probabilities of appearing in combination ... 

Economic and cultural capital produce clear-cut differences between agents situated at extreme ends of the distributions. In the reality of the social world, there are no more clear-cut boundaries than there are in the physical world (13).

The construction of mobilized groups, a permanent organisation, induces durable and recognized divisions.

"What is at stake in symbolic struggles is the imposition of the legitimate vision of the social world and of its divisions, that is to say, symbolic power as worldmaking power ... the power to impose and to inculcate principles of construction of reality, and particularly to preserve or transform established principles of union and separation, of association and disassociation already at work in the social world such as current classifications in matters of gender, age, ethnicity, region or nation, that is, essentially, power over *words* used to describe groups or the institutions which represent them." (14)

Symbolic power is the power to make groups and to consecrate or institute them consists in the power to make something exist in the objectified, public, formal state which only previously existed in implicit state ... begins to exist only when it is selected and begins as such.


To give a brief answer to the question posed:
Be it social, sexual, ethnic or otherwise exist when there are agents capable of imposing themselves, as authorized to speak and to act officially in its place and in its name, upon those who, by recognizing themselves in these plenipotentiaries, by recognizing them as endowed with full power to speak and act in their name, recognize themselves as members of the class, and in doing so, confer upon it the only form of existence a group can possess." 

First, one can posit that an action aimed at transforming the social world is all the more likely to succeed when it is founded in reality. Now the vision of the dominated is doubly distorted in this respect; first because the categories of perception that they use are imposed upon them by the objective structures of the world, and hence tend to foster a form of doxi acceptance of its given order; second because the dominant strive to impose their own vision and to develop representations which offer a "theodicy of their privilege". The dominated have a practical mastery, a practical knowledge of the social world upon which nomination can exert a theoretical effect, an effect of revelation: when it is well-founded in reality, naming involves a truly creative power.
