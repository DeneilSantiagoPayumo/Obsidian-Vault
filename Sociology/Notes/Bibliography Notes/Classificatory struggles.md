## Article Introduction

>[!abstract]
>The problem that the concept of ‘class’ describes is inequality. The transition from industrial to financial capitalism (neoliberalism) in Europe has effected ‘deepening inequalities of income, health and life chances within and between countries, on a scale not seen since before the second world War’ (Hallet al., 2014: 9). In this context, class is an essential point of orientation for sociology if it is to grasp the problem of inequality today. Tracing a route through [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s relational understanding of class, Beverely Skegg’s understanding of class as struggles (over value), and Wendy Brown’s argument that neoliberalism is characterized by the culturalization of political struggles, this article animates forms of class-analysis, with which we might better apprehend the forms of class exploitation that distinguish post-industrial societies. Taking a cue from Jacques Ranciere, the central argument is that the sociology of class should be grounded not in the assumption and valorization of class identities but in an understanding of class as struggles against classification. In this way, sociology can contribute to the development of alternative social and political imaginaries to the bio politics of disposability symptomatic of neoliberal governmentality.

Henry Giroux argues that there are biopolitics of disposability in which poor minorities of colour and class vanish into the sinkhole of poverty - a condition known as "Broken Britain", an ideological displacement that enables structural conditions to be imagined as individual behaviours.

Television as Bourdieu said, is an industry that edits and organizes perception of the world in specific ways - it establishes a consensus that Britain is crawling with workshy malingerers. This goes to inform austerity policies and produces scrape-goats for inequalities that arise from capitalism.

This article wants to ask the question: what is the problem that class describes?

The answer is simple: "the problem that 'class' describes is inequality." (496). In whatever context they are uttered, class names are those that reveal structural conditions of inequality.

"If inequality is the problem that class names, then equality is axiomatic to the sociology of class." (ibid).

The transition from industrial to financial capitalism in Europe has effected 'deepening inequalities of income, health and life chances within and between countries.' (496).

"Class, in whatever historical context or popular, technical or political idiom it is communicated is a recognition of the unequal distribution of resources and the accompanying processes "of exploitation, dispossession, and immiseration that produces the very rich as the privileged class that lives off the rest of us." (Dean, 2012: 74). Further, in the movement that neoliberalism decomposes class relations, new class relations are composed, not least in struggles against the inequalities that neoliberalism effects. *This is why class struggle remains an essential point of orientation for sociology, if it is to grasp the problem of inequality today.*" (498)


## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Class as struggle

[[Jacques Ranciere]] argues that 'class' is a homonym, that have two conflicting meanings. He ascribes in the first government sense, class is understood as "a grouping of people assigned a particular according to their origins or activity" but also an "operator of conflict." That is political names assumed by those in *struggles against* their given position in a social hierarchy.

In *Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste* (1984 [1979]), Bourdieu launched a significant theoretical and methodological challenge to social stratification scholarship, questioning the use of 'statistics in objectivist fashion to establish distributions' (1984: 482). They "put into parentheses the struggle of which [their] distribution is the product" (1984: 245).

The classification of people but is the outcome of *struggles over and against these systems of classification as they are lived in practice* - class is a relational concept, and social classes only emerge through struggle.

```ad-quote
title: 1984, 245
When the statistician forgets that all the properties he handles, not only those he classifies and measures but also those he uses to classify and measure, are weapons and prizes in the struggle between the classes, he is inclined to abstract each class from its relations with the others, not only from the oppositionl relations which give properties their distinctive value, but also from the relations of power and of struggle of power which are the very basis of the distributions.

It provided "a nuanced account of why and how hierarchies of social class persist, even under the ostensibly less stratified conditions of liberal democratic welfare states in post-war Europe.", class hierarchies are shown to emerge not only in struggles between labour and capital, but in and through 'cultural struggles': expression of everyday 'tastes' or 'dislikes', the 'internalization of distinctive signs and symbols of power' and/or the acquisition of cultural competencies. (500)

It gives an array of conceptual tools it bequeathed to sociologists of class. Class, Self, Culture (2004), Bevereley Skeggs draws on feminist and critical race theory - on new formations of the middle classes as acquisitive, individualized and 'flexible' subjects of value. This normative middle-class self is the neoliberal subject par excellence, mobilized as a form of governmentality through (and against) which judgements about class-others are produced 'within popular and political' imaginaries. (500) (Skeggs, 2011: 502). The meritocratic political imaginaries which [[Pierre Bourdieu]] argued mystified class relations have been displaced by hostile forms of class othering.
[
Skegg argues that the working class are depicted as "abject and irresponsible, ungovernable, dirty white..." (Skeggs, 2011: 502). Bourdieu fails to account for the potential of working-class resistance to discursive practices of othering despite his emphasis on class as struggle.

"In other words, classification are not descriptive of the world, "they have consequences in the world and are "operative" - defining the possibilities for action and bounding one's sense of agency." (Waterton, 2003: 113)" (500)


### Class as culture

Distinction teaches us that class struggle is always a matter of access to both economic and cultural resources.

Let us to the CCSE (Cultural Capital and Social Exclusion) and the findings of this project that formed the basis for the BBC's *Great British Class Survey*. It illustrates some of the limitations evident within current class analysis. I argue that Bourdieu's dynamic understanding of class as struggles is effaced by the stratification approach to class and culture adopted within this study.

The CCSE study drew on Bourdieu to examine the relative importance of cultural capital compared with economic and social capital. This findings, published as "Culture, Class, Distinction" "confirmed Bourdieu's thesis that "taste" is a central means of distinguishing social groups, and is 'clearly associated with a sense of social hierarchy.' (502)

How are expressed tastes and the classifying judgements that accompany expressions of taste implicated in the perpetuation of class power and privilege through symbolic violence? 502-503.

As Angela McRobbie have detailed, since 1900s the 'public humiliation of people for their failure to adhere to middle-class standards in speech and appearance' have been normalised - the deserving poor and the rest.

If "class racism" as Bourdieu became an ordinary feature of social life in this period, why did the CCSE study of 'cultural capital' conclude that there was 'little overt contestation and class resentment' in Britain? One reason for this disparity is the limited understanding 'culture' employed in the CCSE study.

In the CCSE study, culture is understood as a diversity of 'cultural products', and 'cultural capital' is understood as expressed 'likes' and 'dislikes'. (503) - definition of culture conceals the central role of symbolic violence in making class relations within and through culture.


### The culturalization of class struggles

The role of new media forms and genres, such as reality TV, in contributing 'to the transmission, legitimation and promotion of the distribution of unequal resource and domination.' (Skeggs and Wood, 2008: 560) 504-505

Television ... is fundamentally constitutive of contemporary social life.

[[Shildrick and MacDonald]] detail the cultural production of class stigma shape 'how people living in poverty talk about poverty - in respect of themselves and others' (2013: 286). The 'powerful set of ideas' that denies poverty and morally condemns "the poor" originates in televisual sociality (2013: 286).

As Wacquant suggests, "what is "neo" about neoliberalism" is precisely the ways in which it involves a 'reengineering and redeployment of the state as the core agency that sets the rule and fabricates the subjectivities, social relations and collective representations suited to realising markets' (Wacquant, 2012: 66). It was imperative that "collective representations" of the structural causes of inequality were transformed.

What distinguishes neoliberal media culture is that class inequalities are rescripted to appear a consequence of individual choices, wealth is 'earned' and poverty is 'deserved'. Wendy Brown (2006) describes this shift as the *culturalization of political struggles*: 'a mode of dispossessing the constitutive histories and powers organizing contemporary problems and contemporary political subjects - that is, depoliticization of sources of political problems" (Brown, 2006: 16).

Ethnographic research reveals intensive forms of "status *discriminations* within the middle classes" as well as articulations "violent intolerance" for racialized and classed others.

"In short, as class inequalities grow, competition for economic and cultural capital, and accompanying forms of classificatory struggle, intensify." 


## Conclusion: cross-class struggles against neoliberalism

The article has brought together a body of recent scholarship on class and culture, in order to make a theoretical contribution to the revitalization of class analysis in the context 'the current malaise of extreme and worsening inequality' (Piketty, 2014: 101).

The nuanced understanding of culture as a political economy, and class as a political aesthetics, which emerges from this body of scholarship, has significant implications for class analysis within sociology, allowing for the development of much deeper understandings of the mechanisms of exploitation which characterize neoliberal modes of governmentality.

Emancipatory struggles against class are often required to be 'strategically essentialist' in revalorizing positive working-class identities against pathologizing representations of a failing underclass.
