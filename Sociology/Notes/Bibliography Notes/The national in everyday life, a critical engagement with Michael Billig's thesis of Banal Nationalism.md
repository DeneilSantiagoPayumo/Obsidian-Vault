I don't want to read Banal Nationalism... so this is a paper discussing it.

```ad-abstract
In the first instance, an overview of Billig's work will be provided, including definitions and the main thrust of his argument. The signifiance of the study to both theories of nationalism and the social sciences in general will then be assessed.

In the second part, I want to adopt a more critical approach by drawing on the work that want to 'test' or interrogate Billig's thesis, focusing on its lack of complexity.

Finally, we will draw attention to Billig's failure to address effectively the place of the nation in a globalising world and the relationship between hot and banal forms of nationalism - a more dynamic model therein is offered.

## Banal nationalism: a brief overview

Michael Billig's study of Banal Nationalism seeks to draw attention to and problematise what he labels as a 'double neglect' in how the contemporary era is understood and theorised (Billig, 1995: 49).

He notes multiple things:

(322)

First, he notes that much of the writing about nationalism is discussed in relation to secure national independence so that in popular representations and the social sciences it becomes conceptualised as 'extraordinary, politically charged and emotionally driven.' (Billig, 1995: 44)

He also discusses those involved in 'outbreaks of hot nationalist passion' are found in remote or exotic areas of the globe, members of extreme 'political' movements: it was the Republican movement and not the British government that were described as nationalist during the 'Troubles' in Northern Ireland. It appears to be an issue for the developed nations of the 'West' both in the spheres of politics and academia.

His second point: why is that 'we' in the 'settled nations' (Billig, 1995:47) who are not labelled nationalist, do not forget our national identity outside of national triumph and flag-waving. In this vein, this question is meant to challenge those who posit equivalence between different group identities. In this vein, national identity must be seen as 'an inner psychological state' defined in terms of the self (Billig, 1995:69)

National identity needs to be conceptualised as a 'form of life which is daily lived in a world of nation-states' (Billig, 1995: 68). It is a form of life so entrenched and taken-for-granted in many parts of the world that is rarely commented upon - it is not that national identity is no longer relevant, merely that symbols that 'flag' the nation on a daily basis no longer register as significant - largely ignored.

He writes (Billig, 1995: 144):
```ad-quote
title: Billig, 1995: 6
The ideological habits, by which our nations are reproduced as nations, are unnamed and therefore unnoticed. The national flag hanging outside a public building in the US attracts no special attention It belongs to no special, sociological genus. Having no name, it cannot be identified as a problem. Nor, by implication, is the daily reproduction of the US a problem.


```

Billig also draws attention to the ways in which both political speeches and mass media routinely reproduce a taken-for-granted world composed of sovereign stations - individual reports are classified as 'home' and 'foreign' news, flagged in relevance to 'us' while a wide range of media texts constitute and address a national audience by using deictic language such as we, our, us and here to signify the nation (Billig 1995: 105)]

333

There is a final aspect - his writing on globalisation. It is noted that Billig rejects those arguments that herald the decline of the nation-state in a new era of global flows and post-modern identities. Instead, he largely equated globalisation with Americanisation.

This argument is backed with reference to the dominance of American cultural industries.

In terms of the role of the media, Philip Schlesinger has constantly highlighted the 'functional relation between the nation and modes of social communication' (2000:99), adopted by scholars including Billig.

This model assumes a national media addresses and constitutes a coherent national public ... able to imagine themselves as belonging to the same community. We can expose the shortcomings of relying on this assumption by looking at the complexity of media output, questioning the notion of a uniform, homogeneous national audience.

Put simply, British newspapers often carry distinct English and Scottish editions, while Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish audiences are served by their own dedicated press which through the use of deixis, location markers, 'flag' their stories accordingly.

In these instances, particular organizations that are designed to serve distinct sections of the population who are constituted on the basis of different conflicting national identities which may or may not be aligned with a state - pointing at the complexity of the media landscape that Billig does not identify properly.

336

Many of these discussions relate to the television and the press - this new era of new media technology often transcending national boundaries, the relationship between the media and the nation being made more complex through the use of the internet (Eriksen, 2007)

The need for a more complex model can be evidenced by problematising the homogeneity of the national audience - scrutinized with reference to media theory and the argument that national identity should also be conceptualized as a 'member's phenomenon'

## National 'audiences': A bottom up approach

One study that wanted to critically evaluate (Yumul and Ozkirimli, 2000: 788) the thesis shifted the analysis beyond a western survey, carrying out a day survey of the press in Turkey - replicating Billig's findings concluding that 'the discourse used by the Turkish press is crammed with the constituent elements of the nationalist ideology'. What limits a study is that it does not attempt to acknowledge the complexity of the national audience beyond a brief nod to 'secular-Islamist conflict' (Billig, 1995: 802).

These theories do not take into account media theory which has argued that audiences cannot be seen as coherent or 'empty vessels', instead that we need to challenge this transmission model of the media and unpack the concept of the audience by asking what role the media play in the articulation of identities (Madianou 2005).

Investigating the role of the media requires an engagement with the different constituencies that are seen to belong to the national community - drawing to attention the complexity of the cultural landscape and the problems of assuming a settled and largely benign socio-political landscape in what Billig has labelled as 'established democratic nations' (1995: 93).

337

One of the weaknesses of this thesis is that it does not address how different constituencies might respond to the particular media texts or how political speeches used as examples of the nation being flagged in a routine or taken-for-granted manner (Billig, 1995: 93) - the privileging of a top-down approach neglects the idea that national identities depend critically on the claims which people themselves make in different contexts and at different times.

...

In relation to Banal Nationalism, it may be unfairly assumed that Billig believes nationalism is banal for everyone who lives in Britain at a current time - this assumption closes out analysis. Who takes their identity for granted, who is passionate, mobilised by a sense of national identification and when do people reject a framework, trying to understand broader patterns as to *why*?

## The global and the national

While Billig is prepared to acknowledge the 'internationalisation of capital' (Billig, 1995: 130),  he pays little attention to the historical causes of contemporary globalisation, dismissing much of what is written as being overstated.

Globalisation is viewed as 'the global transmission of American culture' (149) - citing Levis, Coca Cola, American films and so on. This is a limited thesis.

It is worth nothing that the most sophisticated of these analysis into global flows argue that the increasing inter-connectivity is critical in offering individuals new meanings, values and ways of imagining the world - ensuring a largely un-reflexive, taken-for-granted and everyday discourse of the nation may become subject to increasing scrutiny and challenges.

```ad-quote

collapse: open
Globalisation and nation identity should not be conceived of as in binary terms but as two inextricably linked processes ... they facilitate the expansion of national identities and provide cultural resources that can be domesticated ... global processes may diminish a sense of national identity or reinforce it.

To studies - Robert Saunders focuses on how ethnic minority Russians living in the new nations of Eastern Europe position themselves as operating in a global context where one's worth comes from possessing certain skills, adhering to a consumerist ideology rather than a communal identity.

Lily Kong (1999) studied Singaporean transmigrants working in China to argue that 'transnational location enhances their sense of national identity rather than its demise, leading to assertations of Singaporeness and rootedness' - focusing on the ways that individuals living in Beijing reinvented traditions through everyday practices (eating) and participating in festivals linked to Singapore.

These examples illustrate the need to investigate these complex processes empirically than conceptualizing the national and global as opposing elements involved in a zero sum process of occlusion.

340

It must bee acknowledged that nations are not, never have been, stable, solid, coherent, fixed entities - subject to permanent crises that are legitimate and managed through a process of struggle.

Two things then:
1. Nationalism and globalization need to be reconstructed as co-original and in co-evolution rather than two opposing forces.
2. Conceptualize nation-formation as a dynamic and potentially reversible process that in particular periods and places may become stabilized and naturalized - as Billig observed, informing everyday ways of thinking, imagining and acting - generating 'essentialist conceptions of both society and social agency) - but does not address the dynamic nature of this process, and what underlies these periods of relative stabilization and sedimentation.

## Cooling and heating nationalism

Little attempts are made to discuss how 'hot' nationalism may cool over time.

Could we assess the degree of which these economical and political factors may underpin any processes of cooling over time?

Orvar Lofgren - banal symbols emerged after sustained nationalism and as levels of influence rose
Andreas Wimmer - provision of social welfare helped nationalise working classes who fought against those who were perceived to threaten or dilute their new rights

341

What implications does this have? We should add wider socio-economci factors therein.

John Hutchinson - the nation is a process, and a non-linear one, that is reversible, identifying factors such as war, natural disasters, migration and ideological threat that may create nationalist fervour (riots) and the heating of national identities.

Some examples are listed here. Not added for time purposes.

In this paper:
Billig's major contribution has been to identify a significant lacuna in which sociological thought has taken for granted the nation as a unit of analysis.
However, its main weakness that it overlooks the complexity of national life, disregarding any sense of dynamism.

We cannot presume that particular representations of the nation are resonant for all.
We must try and understand whether and when a national framework is utilized in order to make sense of a particular issue.

It is also important that we pay heed to Sudan Condor's call to view banality as a 'social achievement' (2000:199) - as Laclau (1990:34) says, symbols may become sedimented overtime, not making them any less real, but becoming naturalized for a particular gorup so 'the system of possible alternatives tends to vanish and the traces of the original contingency fade.'
