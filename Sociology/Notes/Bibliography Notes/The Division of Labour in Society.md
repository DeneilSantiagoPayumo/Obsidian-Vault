This ties into [[Theories of Modernity]]
[[Emile Durkheim]]

### Introduction:
This should be read within the context of the attempts to come to grips with the complex division of labour that emerged with the industrial revolution - best understood as an attempt to define and come to grips with an unprecedented system

As the pre-modern division of labour involved divisions between urban artistan and rural folk who were involved in specific trades and occupations. 

The change in the division of labour:
- A change from relative simplicity to rapidly advancing complexity

The emerging industrial form of production involved the gradual replacement of an artisanal mode of production, in which a particular producer fashioned a whole production - emerging from co-ordinated activities.

The final product was the result of the integration of the work of a great number of workers.

Durkheim, compared to Marx and others, was more perturbed of the 'abnormal' conditions of labour: how will a complex and advanced system of division affect cohesion and solidarity of societies. How could the autonomy of the individual be reconciled with the necessary regulation and discipline? How can social bonds be maintained.

The twofold distinction between labour was in tune with nineteenth-century thought, Spencer's distinction between military and industrial societies, Maine's societies based on status as against those based on contract and above all, Tonnies's distinction between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. Whereas these two were convinced that human evolution has led to individualism and a decline of societal regulation, Durkheim was convinced without social solidarity individualism would lead to the decay of society.

Spencer and Maine believed that freely engaged contract between individuals were gradually replacing obsolete solidarities and regulation whereas Durkheim objected that individual contracts could not lay the foundation of a social order and contracts could only be engaged on an already existing moral order. Contracts therein presuppose social order but cannot form its foundation - it hasa primacy over individually motivated actions.

Durkheim asserted that the modern type of individual is a societal creation. He was opposed to the German train of thought which claimed (like Tonnies) that solidarity could only exist in undifferentiated societies.

Organic solidarity, he deemed, could only develop from spontaneously arising consensus between individual actors who are dependent on each other - arising because of complementarity between actors of different pursuits.

This could be compared to the changes of the evolutionary scale - relatively simple organisms show only minimal degrees of differentiation, moving to highly differentiated organisms whose functional specialisation allows them to exploit the resources of the ecological niche in which they seem to be placed.

Durkheim then studied legal codes, asserting that legal regulations can be divided into two types: repressive sanctions, characteristic of penal laws and involve punishment for transgressions and deviance and restitutory sanctions which rely on righting of a balance upset by the violation. Repressive laws comes when deviance is a crime whereas restitutive laws set up the moral obligation to recompense claimants who've been injured. Anything that departed from collective way of life, an infringement of the collective consciousness, was conceived as a crime.

As people engaged in differentiated societal tasks, they developed new institutional relations and moral ideas. Different economic infrastructures produced different forms of superstructures - as people now engaged in differentiated societal tasks and work routines, they developed new institutional relations and moral ideas. These essential differences were to be sought on the structural or morphological level.

Another shift in Durkheim's analytical approach at the time of writing *The Division of Labour* needs to be mentioned - the collective consciousness, a conception that Durkheim largely developed in derivation from [[Rosseau and the Discourse on the Origin of Inequality|Rosseau]]'s' 'general will' and Comte's 'consensus' - this common consciousness seems to be the defining characteristic of societies grounded in mechanical solidarity.

Durkheim stresses that the collective consciousness in the world of modernity can no longer define the specific norms that pertains to the exercise of differentiated tasks.

This world is marred by a variety of pathological phenomena, the industrial scene characterised by hostility and struggle between labour and capital, normlessness, lack of regulation and so on. Durkheim argues that these normal states of affairs, class struggles and commercial crises, are abnormal and pathological.

Durkheim finds a solution in the ideas of Saint-Simon and August Comte, that there were indeed 'organic' periods of harmony and 'critical' periods of transition.

The division of labour is 'abnormal', one standing from 'forceful imposition' that weakens human enterprise. Though Durkheim was by no means averse to state intervention, his action for saving this society did not include state action: state action is too far removed from the lives of ordinary men and women to be of much utility in overcoming the contemporary anomic and forced division of labour - what was required here was the re-emergence of 'secondary institutions' - a concept conceived by Tocqueville.

Durkheim envisioned in which new types of corporations would be instituted in which both employers and employees would be represented - the administrative council would have the power to regulate labour relations, wages and salaries, conditions of work, appointments and there would be a central administrative council for a given branch of industry.

Durkheim was convinced of the pathology of present-day society - but the present malaise and anomie could be traced to transitional difficulties that could be overcome with new norms. The more conservative strands of thoughts however led him to neglect the possibility that the disorders are inherently linked with the structure of capitalist society, with his liberal conscience meaning to harmonise relations between employers and employees.

Durkheim was also convinced that an excessive growth of state power would lead to an extinction of autonomous individuality that he prized above all - a society made up of a large mass of unorganised individuals.

A major flaw in Durkheim's mode of argumentation is he tendency as [[Steven Lukes]] puts it to assume an identity between the normal, the ideal and what was bound to happen. He refused to accepted the general social phenomena as 'normal' even if they went counter to his ideal moral demands and standards. It does no particular credit to his rigour.

Durkheim's idea that simple societies lack restitutive sanctions is flawed: we learn from [[Malinowksi]] that pre-modern societies rely a lot on reciprocal obligations, based on restitution whenever the various forces of society are upset.

# BOOK 1 THE FUNCTION OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR

Trends in modern industry - powerful mechanisms, large-scale groupings of power and capital.

We can see the division of labour in the most diverse sectors of society - political, administrative or judicial fields. Even the scientist has to limit his research.

Is it our duty to be a rounded creature or a part of the whole. Is the division of labour a moral rule for human conduct?


## Chapter I: The Method of Determining This Function

Function designates a system of living movement, or the corresponding relationship existing between these movements and certain needs of the organism. The division of labour does not exist purely for this result - the term function is better.

We must pick out some fact that might serve to measure the average level of morality and observe its variations as civilisation progresses. 

As the environment in which societies lives becomes more complex, they must change frequently in order to survive.

The more the consciousness remains unenlightened, the more averse it is to change. Enlightened consciousness has learnt how to prepare itself beforehand.

Very often we're drawn to people who do not resemble us. Dissimilarity can be a cause of mutual attraction. Only differences of a certain kind incline us towards one another.

We seek in our friends the qualities we lack: the one protects, the other consoles; one advises, the other executes, and it is this distribution of functions ... that determines these relations of friendship.

It's true function therein is to create between two or more people a feeling of solidarity.

Observing in the past, the strength difference between men and women have not been so much. Only recently has she become 'weak'. Nowadays, women have withdrawn from public affairs, her role has become even  more specialised - leading an existence entirely different from the mans.

If arts and letters are beginning to become matters that occupy women, the other sex seems to abandon them so they could devote themselves more to science.

Therefore, the division of labour not only increases the productivity of functions, but links them closely together - to make possible societies. Individuals are linked although they would've been independent, tied to one another.

Could the division in labour play the same role in extensive groupings - these great political societies cannot sustain their equilibrium save by the specialisation of tasks.

[[Comte]] pointed out that in the division of labour, there was 'the most essential condition of social life' - a condition of existence for modern societies, that the cohesion thereof would be ensured.

Social solidarity is a moral phenomenon which is not amenable to exact observation. We must delve down to its degree of sociability in an abstraction - forms of solidarity, creating an incomplete explanation of the phenomenon. This is why we could classify different types of laws to investigate which types of social solidarity correspond to them.

There are two types of laws: one that seeks to deal harm, repressive sanctions, and restitutive laws that restore the previous state of affairs. 
## Chapter II: Mechanical Solidarity, or Solidarity by Similarities

The bond of social solidarity to which repressive law corresponds to is the breaking of what constitutes the crime.

Crime designates an act that provokes against the perpetrator the characteristic reaction known as punishment.

Penal laws expressed for each type of society the basic conditions for life. They ran through necessity. Actions of repression are usually further exaggerated compared to the degree of damage it is called - look at murder.

All written law serves a dual purpose: to prescribe certain obligations, and to define the sanctions attached. In civil law, the legislator approaches, determining the nature of the obligation, and the manner of the sanction applied. By contrast, penal law prescribes only sanctions - punishment, affirming a rule accepted by everyone.

In primitive societies, law is wholly penal in character.

The collective sentiments to which a crime corresponds must be distinguished from other sentiments by some striking characteristic - they must be of a certain average intensity. They must be deeply written. They must evoke emotion within us.

Generally religious law is always repressive. It is essentially conservative. This character of penal law demonstrates the strength of resistance exerted by the collective sentiments to which it corresponds. 

The sentiment that purely moral sanctions protect are diffuse, less intense, less solidly organised - these sentiments must be precise. Sentiments like filial love or charity are vague aspirations, penal laws are notable for clarity whereas moral rules are fluid in character.

The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can be termed the collective or common consciousness.

To sum up: an act is criminal when it offends the strong, well-defined states of the collective consciousness.

If the brain is of importance, the stomach is likewise an essential organ. The machinery of government plays an outstanding role in social life, but there are other bodies in society whose interest continue to be vital. Why is this privileged position accorded to what is occasionally called the 'brain' of society?

We then perceive that wherever an authority with power to govern is established its first and foremost function is to ensure respect for beliefs. Energy immanent is communicated to that authority, it becomes a symbol of that consciousness.

It is always to the collective consciousness that we must return. From it, all criminality flows.


In the first place, punishment constitutes an emotional reaction. This characteristic is all the more apparent the less cultured societies are.

Nowadays, punishment has changed in nature - society no longer punishes to avenge but to defend itself. Punishment has adapted itself to the new conditions of existence created for it.

It would be mistaken to believe that vengeance is mere cruelty - it destroys what was a threat to us, a veritable act of defence. Although the individual or social consciousness does not fail to influence the reality it highlights, it has no power to change the nature of that reality. The internal structure of the phenomena remains unchanged.

That said punishment is an outrage to morality - the shame that doubles most punishment and increases it is what leads to restitutive learning. 

The nature of punishment has remained essentially unchained. The spirit of foresight that has been awakened no longer leaves the field so clear for the blind play of passion, containing within it set limits. Nonetheless, it lies at the heart of the penal system.

Religion is something essentially social - it exercises constraint over the individual at every moment, obliging him to observe practices that are irksome to him and sacrifices. The religious life is made up of altruism.

Private vengeance is far from being the prototype of punishment, an incomplete punishment - far from the crimes against the person being the first to be repressed, they are merely situated on the threshold of the penal law. They only moved up in the scale of criminality as society assumed control of them more completely.

When we reflect upon penal law as it functions, we represent it as a code in which very precise punishments are attached to crimes equally precisely defined. The punishment is predetermined for each category of criminal acts. 

Even among these punishments laid down by the legislator, there are many that are not precisely specified. There were different forms of capital punishment which were not all on the same footing.

It is not the regulation of punishment that constitutes the distinctive organisation of this kind of repression, nor is it the institution of a criminal procedure - the facts we have cited show that this punishment was reduced to the establishment of a court of law: the reaction of society was expressed through the intermediary of a well-defined organism.

Punishment is a reaction of passionate feeling, graduated in intensity which society exerts through the mediation of an organised body.



Every strong state of the consciousness is a source of life. It is an essential factor in our general vitality. All that tends to weaken it diminishes and depresses us. The result is an impression of being disturbed and upset. It is inevitable that we react against what threatens us.

Representation is not a simple image of reality. It is a force that stirs up around us a whirlwind of organic and psychological phenomena. It offers resistance to the free play of our personal feeling but also weakens it, attracting in an opposite direction an entire part of our energy. It is as though a foreign force had penetrated us. Any assault on it provokes an emotional reaction.

These social currents flow from the causes that produce them, assisting in maintaining such causes. All such violent emotions really constitute an appeal to additional forces.

We are aware of how much force a belief may acquire because they are experienced within a single community of people in contact with one another. 
When we seek repression for a crime, it is that we seek vengeance for something sacred which we feel is above us. We conceive of this object in different ways: sometimes a simple idea, sometimes divinity.

These illusions dominate us and bind us to objects that lie outside our existence in time. They are an echo resounding within ourselves of a force that is alien. we are forced to project them outside ourselves - an alienation of personality.

The social character of the reaction derives from the social nature of the sentiments offended - it is the collective, sentiments attract.

If the state of feeling is offended, the entire group attacked closes ranks in danger, clinging to one another - on the contrary, the anxiety that has spread from one to another impels forcibly together all those who resemble one another. This institution of this power serves to sustain the common consciousness itself.



Under these conditions all members of the group are linked to what is the condition for the existence of this collective type, wishing for what it would wish for themselves.

Two consciousnesses exist within us: the one comprises only states that are personal to each one of us, the former representing our individual personality, the latter representing the collective type and the society without which it would not exist. They are one entity ... solidly joined together.

It is this solidarity that repressive law expresses such acts manifest a violent dissimilarity between the one who commits them and the collective type, offending the organ of the common consciousness.

It is that force which the penal law guards against being weakened, insisting on similarities and marking the individual as a threat to the unity of the body.

It's real function (punishment) is to maintain inviolate the cohesion of society by sustaining the common consciousness in all its vigour. Thus there'd be a relaxation in the bonds of social solidarity.

## Chapter III: Solidarity Arising from the Division of Labour, or Organic Solidarity

The distinguishing mark of this is that it merely restores the status quo - restoring them to what actions should be. It is simply putting back the clock.

Justice isn't administered for free - costs should be borne by the one who has occasioned them.

Restitutory law sets itself to be specialized - not merely concerning private individuals. 

To sum up: the rules relating to 'real' rights and personal relationships are established to form a definite system to detach various parts of society from each other, not corresponding to any positive social tie. The first condition for an entity to become coherent is for the parts not to clash: an external harmony brings about cohesion, negative solidarity is only possible when another kind is present, positive in nature.

The rights individual possess over each other can only be determined through compromise.

The goal of restitutory law is then thus to bring back the status quo.

With legal laws, overlapping is constantly occurring between these different rights so that one cannot realise the value of one right without encroaching upon the other rights that limit it - relationships are therefore needful to repair the damage if it has already been done, or prevent it happening. They restore the conditions that brought back the damage.

If we assume a host of individuals with no previous ties binding them to one another, what might have compelled them to make reciprocal sacrifices - the feelings that cause them to turn towards one another prompt egoism, that we must make concessions to one another using the full force of society.

Justice constitutes its basic foundation, charity its crowning glory - justice alone is needful for the smooth functioning of social life, altruism is scarcely more than a private virtue. For me to lead a good life, to acknowledge the rights of one another, they must have a mutual liking that makes them cling to one another - justice is filled with charity, negative solidarity is the manifestation of another solidarity that is positive in nature, the repercussions of social feelings in the sphere of 'real' rights.

For example, civil law expresses the 'special solidarity' that unites members of a family as the result of the domestic division of labour.

This specialisation of function is directly manifest in the commercial code, which especially regulates contracts specific to commerce: contracts between agent and principle and so on, a great gap existing between the comparatively general nature of the law, and the diversity of special functions.

To sum up: relationships that are regulated by co-operative law, with its restitutory sanctions, and the solidarity these relationships express, result form the social division of labour.

For something to be the object of shared sentiment, the first condition that it should be shared, present in every consciousness, and each individual may be able to conceive of it from a single viewpoint. These rules determine the manner in which the different functions should work together.

Laws play a part analogous in society to that of the nervous system, regulating bodily functions in a way that they work harmoniously together, expressing in a natural way, the degree of concentration that the organism has reached. 



Positive solidarity - links the individual directly to society, and denotes a more or less organised society composed of beliefs.
This mechanical solidarity assumes that individuals are far different from each other. The each of us depend so much on society the more labour is divided up, and on the other, the activity of each one of us is more specialised, the more personal it is.

## Chapter IV: Another Proof of the Preceding Theory

Primitive societies are similar whereas modern societies are easily distinguishable.
Law in primitive societies is repressive:

## Chapter V: The Increasing Preponderance of Organic Solidarity and its Consequences

The common consciousness creates weaker states through morals and public opinion.

Penal law looms larger the farther we get away from our present social organisation - penal law looms correspondingly larger the farther we get away from our personal social organisation - what is vital in the structures of our societies.

The strength of social ties is the ease of which they are broken.

Society requires from each of its members a uniformity of beliefs and practices, yet it can lose a certain number of those subjected to it without its internal functioning being disturbed.



The strength of these bonds derive from: the relationship between the common consciousness and individual consciousness
The intensity of the states of collective consciousness.
The degree if determinateness of the same state, the less room of which beliefs and practices allow for individual divergences.

Such states with strong well-defined states of common consciousness are fewer today than in the past likely because the intensity and determinateness of the collective states have diminished.


The regulation of domestic life has almost entirely lost every trace of its penal character.
The considerable loss from the penal code is the one due to the total disappearance of religious crimes, a host of sentiments that have ceased to be counter among the strong and well-defined states of the common consciousness.


There has been a number of varieties of crime that have progressively disappeared without any compensating factors. The conception that serves as the foundation for this doctrine is contradiction, assuming primitive people are bereft of morality. All that is true about the theory is that it forbids attacks against the person, for men who are similar cannot live together without feeling sympathy. 

The common consciousness comprises fewer strong and well-defined sentiments as the average intensity and degree of determinateness of the collective states of feelling continue still to diminish.

Everything goes to prove that the evolution of the common consciousness proceeds along the lines we have indicated, progressing less than does the individual consciousness, becoming weaker and vaguer as a whole.

As beliefs assume less religious a character, the individual becomes the object of a sort of religion. It is from society that it draws all this strength, but it is not society that it binds us: it is ourselves.

Indeed, since mechanical solidarity is growing weaker, social life must diminish or another form of solidarity must emerge to take the place of the one that is disappearing. The more we evolve, the more societies develop a profound feeling of themselves and their unity. There must be another link to bring about this result.
## Chapter VI: The Increasing Preponderance of Organic Solidarity and its Consequences (cont.)

Mechanical solidarity will lose grounds and organic solidarity will become preponderant. It is inevitable that the structure of societies should change.

If we try to constitute the ideal type of a society whose cohesion results exclusively from resemblances, we conceive it as a homogenous mass - a horde.

We shall give the term 'clan' to a horde that has ceased to be independent. We term them to be 'segmentary' to denote that they are formed from the replication of aggregates. They sustain mutual relationships that might be termed domestic.

In these cultures, religion pervades social life, made up of common beliefs and practices.


The structure of societies where organic solidarity is preponderant is different. These are constituted by a system of different organs each of which has a special role and which themselves are formed from differentiated parts.

This social type relies upon principles so different from the preceding type that it can only develop to the extent that the latter has vanished.

It is a general law that the partial aggregates that make up an extensive aggregate see their individuality as growing less and less distinctive. Gradually local customs and local religions merge and unify, losing autonomy - a simple consequence of the law of imitation. It seems like a levelling-out analogous to that which occurs when two liquids intermingle together.



This does not signify that these associations (colonies) are made up of continuous tissues is in reality an individual. What is characteristic of the individuality of any kind of aggregate is the existence of operations carried out in common by all its parts. What makes radical separation impossible is that there are no organisms at all.

There exists in the animal world an individuality 'which is produced outside any combination of organs'

To sum up: there are two types of solidarity, developing inversely and informed by the social division of labour. This gives cohesion to society.

## Chapter VII: Organic Solidarity and Contractual Solidarity

It is true that in industrial societies social harmony derives from the division of labour. 

It does not follow that the sphere of individual activity is growing smaller: if life is more regulated, it is also more abundant. Other forms are developing, restitutory law is growing.


It is true that contractual relationships that originally were rare are multiplied as labour in society is divided up.
Let us examine the section of the law that is termed private and regulates the relationship between the diffused social functions and the innermost life of the social organism.

Domestic law has become increasingly complex, the relationships that result from them pre-eminently a positive kind, a reciprocity of rights and duties. It is not contractual.

To sum up: at the same time as domestic obligations are becoming more numerous, they are taking on a public character: having no contractual origin, but the role played by contract is continually decreasing. The social control over the way in which obligations are entered into and dissolved is modified and is constantly increasing. The social control over the way in which obligations are entered into and dissolved is modified and continually increasing - lying in the disappearance of the segmentary organisation.

It is also on the interplay that social action is to be felt - not everything in a contract is contractual.

When social action is not stated in this express form, it does not cease to be real - this possibility of dispensing with the law is purely theoretical.

Men need each other for the entire duration of their relationship - leaving people distinct and in opposition to each other. It is necessary for the allocation of rights and obligations to be prescribed for the length of their relationships.

Contractual law exists to determine the legal consequences of those of our acts that we have not settled beforehand, the normal conditions for attaining equilibrium. Viewed in this light, the law of contract appears very differently, imposing upon us the traditional authority of experience and the foundation of our contractual relationships.

The contract is not sufficient by itself, but is possible by the regulation of contract - a social origin. The function of contract is less to make new rules. Regulation is necessary.



Administrative law is the set of rules that determine the functions of the central organ and their relationships. The social action expressed is of a positive kind, fixing how these special functions should co-operate.

So long as each segment has life of its own, it forms a small society and has its own special regulatory organs.

Any organism lives in a environment where the more complex it is, the larger the number of its relationships.


The following propositions are thus:
1. Social life is derived from a dual source, the similarity of individual consciousnesses and the social division of labour
2. The similarity of consciousnesses give rise to legal rules which impose upon everybody uniform beliefs and practices
3. The division of labour gives rise to legal rules that determine the nature and relationships of the function thus divided up.
4. Each set of legal laws is accompanied by a set of rules that are purely moral.
5. These rules are purely categorical, forcing the individual to act in accordance with ends that are not for his own, to agree to compromises, to take into account interests superior to his own.
6. Morality is not the same nature as the other, the latter strong only if the individual is weak, made up of rules practiced by all without distinction - receiving from it something superhuman.
