# The Jack Wills crowd: towards a sociology of an elite subculture

## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
British sociologists have long been interested in youth sub-cultures. However British sociologists have tended to focus on working class subcultures and avoid edengagement with exclusive sub-cultures of elite social groups. This article seeks to attend to this gap by examining the subculture of a British elite: ex-public schoolstudents at select universities in the UK in the twenty-first century. This groupconsists of a relatively small group of young adults, aged between 18 and 23, whoattended public schools, especially one of the nine Clarendon schools (Eton, Winchester, Westminster, St. Paul’s, Merchant Taylor’s, Shrewsbury, Rugby,Harrow and Charterhouse), and were students at a selective group of British universities, primarily Oxford and Cambridge, Durham, Bristol, Exeter, Bath, Manchester, St Andrews and Edinburgh. The article examines the way in which this group has reconfigured and re-constituted itself in the face of globalizing challenges. Specifically, it examines the way in which participation of ex-public school students in events run by and under the patronage of the high street retail-ing company, Jack Wills, has played a galvanising role for this group in the last decade. The Jack Wills crowd is an example of how some young adults form exclusive social networks and reproduce prevailing forms of privilege. The social networks built around the Jack Wills subculture is likely to provide them with advantages in the job market through a prodigious network of connections and patrons. The Jack Wills subculture potentially contributions to the socio-economic reproduction of the higher professional middle classes.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

British sociologists mainly study youth sub-cultures, namely working-class groups without engaging with elite social groups. Subcultures therein are seen as "the result of processes of domination where alternative tastes and styles are used as weapons against the hegemonic culture of the dominant class."(45)

But subcultures also exist in subaltern social groups - subculture does not have to refer to a marginalized group but also to a small, unified and culturally distinctive association. There can be elite subcultures wherein members generate exclusive lifestyles whose practices are marginal to the dominant culture.

### How is the article organised?

N/A

### What are the key takeaways?

This article examines a subculture of a British elite, ex-public school students students at elite universities. These members are overwhelmingly white, sons and daughters of parents living in higher professions - it is unified by a common experience - public school - and family wealth is so critical in creating the conditions for individuals to become members of this elite group because of the high fees.

The cohort of public school students at British universities have in the past been known as 'Sloanes', 'Hooray Henrys', 'Wellies' or 'Toffs' and this article examines the ways in which this group has been reconfigured and the ways in which participation of ex-public school students in events run by the high street company Jack Wills have galvanized this group.

These groups contribute to social reproduction, guaranteeing themselves higher opportunities.


## Methods and Data Sources

### How was this data collected?

Interviews.

Smith conducted interviews and fieldwork among three seasonal activities over the period August 2010 to June 2013. Smith attended five Jack Wills event sites that allowed them to develop a network of contacts to observe and participate in their social activities.  Access was made through sponsored societies but not directly with the brand.(49-50).

### What, if any are the pitfalls behind how the data was gathered? Does the author address this?

Jack Wills, as they wanted to generate and maintain an exclusive brand, refused to participate in the research. They forbid their workers from talking about the company publicly.

Thus, the research had to proceed through entry and participation in the subculture.

The research network represents a small part of the active network of one thousand students. That said, the views can be seen as representative of the network: prominent members in this group were acknowledged as leaders within these social groups, the centre of networks and had huge social capital. (p, 50-51)
### Special notes on the article. (47-50)

It's important to understand Jack Wills to understand this article.

- The founder of the brand, Peter Williams, identified elite public school youths as a potentially untapped market and sought to generate merchandise that resonated with their lifestyle.
- They identified key agents in the town who could promote their goods which grew their popularity, and sought to move their stores to luxury, grand locations.
- Jack Wills did not confine its activities to the high street but targeted exclusive sub-groups within these schools, where members of Jack Wills' subculture congregates - Oxford and Cambridge skiing and polo matches that they sponsor, the varsity polo and more.
- Jack Wills organizes a Summer Seasonnaire programme in which university students are hired by the brand to live in affluent seaside towns whey put on beach and store parties, partake in life-style activities and more. 

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The dispersion thesis

We live in a life that [[Thomas Piketty]] calls 'meritocratic extremism' where inequalities rest on 'just' claims to merit and skill. The economic position of the elite has substantially increased over time. (52).

[[Brooks and Waters]] showcases how private establishments are forced to internationalize in response to financial pressures while nevertheless disguising this process through the maintenance of a highly distinctive educational habitus - namely the active attempt of universities to recruit international student and exploit Chinese demand for Anglophone degrees. (52-53)

There is thus no longer the "easy familiarity of educational institutions in the 1980s" as there is a huge diversity of new students. (54)

Jack Wills has played a crucial and timely role for this group at a time of globalizing disturbances. By instituting trans-university events which unite Oxbridge with a selection of elite universities in Britain, Jack Wills has provided an important service for this increasingly dispersed group. Jack Wills has become the self-conscious medium by which the youthful cohort of the higher professions has been able to reconstitute itself, even as it has been distributed across the university sector. The traditional location of Oxbridge as the site of condensation and concentration has been diminished to be replaced by the compensatory locale of the trans-university network, realized in heightened moments of communal gathering; the Jack Wills university tour, the Varsity Polo match, the Varsity ski match, the BUSC Main Event week and the summer Seasonnaire programme. Ironically, these elite events and attendant Jack Wills subculture have become a means by which the children of the higher professions have reasserted their collective group identity in a time of dislocation.

Because the marketing strategy cannot locate themselves to the 200-300 people at Oxbridge, Jack Wills have made the process of recruiting ex-public school students studying at Russell group universities.

Thus, ex-public school students have actively sought to create cross-university networks with former school friends. As Jack Wills requires a larger core market than Oxbridge, the result is that Jack Wills has been able to establish itself as a conduit for undergraduates from the social elite to maintain and indeed widen social relations with each other. 

The Seasonnaire programme that seeks to enhance Jack Wills brand identity has "facilitated the formation of a localized network but, also, it has the crucial role of limiting the expansion of the group - in order to maintain elite exclusivity" (59)

### Colours

These networks are limited in varied ways: namely, they are restricted to face-to-face acquaintances.

"In order for the Jack Wills crowd to operate as a social group, it is necessary to incorporate individuals who are not known personally to the leaders in this field and for members of this would be class to recognise themselves self consciously as a unified group: not simply a loose social association based on personal ties." (59).

Thus, the Varsity Polo match take a role in coalescing network associations into a coherent group.

### Colours

We will focus on one strategy that feature in the Varsity Polo: the use of colours. The question for Jack Wills is what symbol would most effectively mobilize public school memories among students to bind them together - most pressingly with the jaunty strutting pheasant.

However, it is an aristocratic symbol. If we look at the colours, they have been developed to maximize their emotive significance and ability to enrol students into this would-be subculture: drawn from elite and public schools that their student target group will recognise.

These colours are associated with public school. These colours have become institutionalized as a central element of these institutions' corporate identities. These colours are entangled in an honours system whereby sporting achievement was marked by 'getting colours'.

[[Emile Durkheim]] has written on how potent symbols dwindle without periodic re-energization in the collective ritual but symbols themselves must be periodically vivified by collective acts of affirmation.

The multiple connotations of school colours is reinvigorated with new associations around the polo - attention is given by a ceremonial prize-giving of trophies, gift-bags and a memorial varsity shirt handed to them by CEO Peter Williams.

"The bright colours preferred by the participants subtly connotate the colours of the public school, such as pink blazers evoking Charterhouse and Westminster, or the blue blazers of Eton and Oxbridge." (63)


Really, despite policies to open access to less privileged students, the emergence of a Jack Wills subculture has reinforced the exclusivity of that lifestyle.

This is an account of class reproduction in contemporary British society.
