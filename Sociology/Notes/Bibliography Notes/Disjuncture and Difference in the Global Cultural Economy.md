[[Nations and nationalism]]

295

The central problem of today's global interactions is the tension between cultural homogenization and cultural heterogenization.

Many of these arguments sub speciates into either an argument about Americanization or commoditization, but often what these arguments fail to consider is that forces from various metropolises are brought into new societies, they become indigenized - from music and housing styles, to science and terrorism.

One man's another imagined community is another man's political prison.

This scalar dynamic is tied to the relationship between nations and states.

296

The simplification of forces and fears of homogenization can be exploited by nation-states in relation to their own minorities.

The new global cultural economy has to be understood as a complex, overlapping, disjunctive order, which cannot be understood in terms of existing centre-periphery models. It is not susceptible to simple models of push and pull, surpluses and deficits.

An elementary framework for exploring such disjuncture is to look at the relationship between five dimensions of global cultural flow which can be termed:

1. Ethnoscapes
2. Mediascapes
3. Technoscapes
4. Finanscape
5. Ideoscapes

These are not objectively given relations - [[Benedict Anderson]] would call these 'imagined worlds', the multiple worlds which are constituted by the historically situated ... 

297

An important fact of the world we live in today is that many persons on the globe live in such imagined worlds and not just in imagined communities and thus are able to contest and even subvert the 'imagined worlds' of the official mind and of the entrepreneurial mentality that surrounds them.

- Ethnoscapes - landscapes of persons who constitute the shifting world in which we live: tourists, immigrants, refugees, exiles, guestworkers and other moving groups and persons constitute an essential feature of the world, and appears to affect the politics of and between nations to a hitherto unprecedented degree. These realities as well as these fantasies now function on a larger scale .. as men and women in India think of moving to Dubai and Houston
- Technoscape - global configuration ... moves at high speeds across various kinds of boundaries ... distribution of technology driven by ... complex relationships between money flows, political possibilities and the availability of both low and highly-skilled labour.
- Finanscape - the disposition of global capital is a more mysterious, rapid and difficult landscape to follow - currency markets, national stock exchanges, and commodity speculations ... the critical point is that the global relationship between ethnoscape, technoscapes and finanscapes is deeply disjunctive and profoundly unpredictable ... an elementary model of global political economy must take into account relationships between perspectives.

There there are these disjunctures that form a simple mechanical global infrastructure (299):
- Mediascape - the distribution of the electronic capabilities to produce and disseminate information ... providing large and complex repertoires of images ... the lines between the realistic and fictional landscapes they see are blurred ... constructing 'imagined worlds' which are aesthetic. They tend to be image-centred, narrative-based accounts of strips of reality...
- Ideoscapes are a concatenation of images, deeply political and have to do with the ideologies of states and the counter-ideologies of movements explicitly orientated to capturing state power or a piece of it. They are composed of elements of the Enlightenment, freedom, rights, sovereignty.

As a result of the differential diaspora of these keywords, the political narratives that govern between elites of the following involve a problem of semantic (to the extent they need careful translation) and pragmatic (the use of these words may be subject to very different sets of contextual conventions that mediate their translation into public politics).

These conventions involve the far more subtle question of what sets of communicative genres are valued in what way and what sorts of pragmatic genre conventions govern the collective 'readings' of different kind of text. The very relationship of reading to hearing and seeing may vary in important ways that determine the morphology of these different 'ideoscapes' as they shape themselves in different national and transnational contexts.

301

Democracies has clearly become a master-term ... this creates ever new terminology kaleidoscopes, as states seek to pacify population whose own ethnoscapes are in motion, and whose mediascapes may create severe problems for the ideoscapes with which they are presented... 

The fluidity of ideoscapes is complicated in particular by the growing diasporas of intellectuals who inject meaning into the discourse of democracy in different parts of the world.

These current global forms occur under the basis of tentative formulation about the condition under which current global flows occur: they occur in and through and the growing disjuncture between ethnoscapes, technoscapes, finanscape, mediascapes and ideoscapes.

People, machinery, money, images, and ideas now follow increasingly non-isomorphic paths: the sheer speed and scale and volume of each of these flows is now so great that the disjunctures have become central to the politics of global culture. 

Deterrorialization in general is one of the central forces of the modern world since it brings labouring populations into the lower class sectors and space of relatively wealthy societies - creating exaggerated and intensified senses of criticism or attachment to politics in the home-state. Deterritorialization is now at the core of a variety of global fundamentalism, including Islamic and Hindu fundamentalism.

302

It also creates new markets for film companies, art impressarios and travel agencies who thrive on the need of the deterritorialized population for contact with his homeland. In turn, these movements of monies are the basis of the new kind of conflict (money managers seek the best markets for the investments, independent of national boundaries).

303

It is this fertile ground of deterritorialization, in which money, commodities and persons are involved in ceaselessly chasing each other around the world that the mediascapes and ideoscapes of the modern world find their fractured and fragmented counterpart, for ideas and images produced by mass media often are only partial guides to the goods and experiences that deterritorialized populations transfer to one another.

It is appropriate at the juncture to bring in the role of the nation-state in the disjunctive global economy of culture today. The relationship between states and nations is everywhere an embattled one - while nations ... seek to capture or co-opt states and state power, states simultaneously seek to capture and monopolize ideas about nationhood.

In general, separatist, transnational (304) movements exemplify nations in search of states: Sikhs, Tamil Sri Lankans, Basques, Moros, Quebecois - represent imagined communities which seeks to create states of their own or carve pieces out of existing states.

304

States are seeking to monopolize the moral resources of community, either by flatly claiming perfect coevality between nation and state, systematically museumizing and representing all the groups within them in a variety of heritage politics that seem remarkably uniform throughout the world.

Here, national and international mediascapes are exploited by nation-states to pacify separatists or even the potential fissiparousness of all ideas of difference.

One important new feature of global cultural politics tied to the disjunctive relationships between the various landscapes discussed earlier, is that the state and nation are at each's throats, and the hyphen that links them is now less an icon of conjuncture than an index of disjuncture.

It has two levels:
1. At the level of any given nation-state, it means that there is a battle of the imagination with the state and nation seeking to cannibalize one another. This is the seed of brutal separatisms, majoritarianisms that have appeared from nowhere, and micro-identities that have become political projects.
2. At another level, this relationship is entangled with the global disjuncture, ideas of nationhood appear to be steadily increasing in scale and regularly crossing existing state boundaries

In discussing the cultural politics that have subverted the hyphen that links the nation to the state, it is especially important not to forget its mooring in the irregularities that now characterize 'disorganized capital' - labour, finance and technology are now so widely separated that volatilities that underlie movements for nationhood.

305

States find themselves pressed to stay open by the forces of media, consumerism and so on. On the other hand, these very cravings can become caught up in new ethnoscapes, mediascapes, and eventually, ideoscapes - democracy in China, that the state cannot tolerate as threats to its own control over ideas of nationhood and peoplehood. States here are under siege, under contests over ideoscapes of democracy and where there are radical disjunctures between ideoscapes and technoscapes (in the case of countries that lack contemporary technology) , or between ideoscapes and finanscapes (in countries of Mexico or Brazil where international lending influences national politics to a very large degree), between ideoscapes and ethnoscapes (in Beirut for example) or between mediascapes and ideoscapes where the lifestyle represented on both national and international TV and cinema completely overwhelm and undermine the rhetoric of national politics.

306

The central paradox of ethnic politics in today's world is that primordia have become globalized - sentiments whose greatest force is their ability to ignite intimacy into a political sentiment and turn locality into a staging ground for identity, spread over vast spaces, yet stay linked to one another through media capabilities - emphasizing that because of the disjunctive and unstable interplay of commerce, media, national policies and consumer fantasies, ethnicity ... has become a global force.

But the relationship between the cultural and economic levels of this new set of global disjuncture is not a simple one-way street in which the terms of global cultural politics are set wholly by the vicissitudes of international flows of technology, labour and finance - demanding a modest modification of existing neo-Marxist models.

The author begins with Marx's fetishism of the commodity - suggesting that this fetishism has been replaced in world at large, a huge interactive system by two mutually supportive descendants - production fetishism and fetishism of the consumers.

By production fetishism - an illusion created by contemporary transnational production, masks trans local capital, transnational earning-flows, global management and often faraway workers in the idiom and spectacle of local control, national productivity and territorial sovereignty.

307

The locality becomes a fetish that disguises the globally dispersed forces that actually drive the production process. This generates alienation ... twice intensified, for its social sense is now compounded by a complicated spatial dynamic which is increasingly global.

As for the fetishism of the consumer, the consumer has been transformed through commodity flows into a sign - in [[Baudrillard]]'s sense of a simulacrum which only approaches the form of a real social agent; and in the sense of a mask for the real seat of agency ... the producer and the many forces that constitute production.

Global advertising is the key technology for the world-wide dissemination of a plethora of creative, and culturally well-chosen, ideas of consumer agency.

The globalization involves the use of a variety of instruments of homogenization which are absorbed into local political and cultural economies. In general, repatriation or export of teh designs and commodities of difference.

Thus, the central feature of global culture today is the politics of the mutual effort of sameness and difference to cannibalize one another (308) and proclaim their successful hijacking of the twin Enlightenment ideas of the triumphantly universal and resiliently particular.

It shows it ugly face in riots, refugee-flows and so on: its brighter side is in the expansion of many individual horizons of hope and fantasy, in the global spread of oral rehydration therapy and other low-tech instruments of wellbeing.

Both sides of the coin of the global contest of sameness and difference on a stage characterized by radical disjuncture, the brighter side is in the expansion of many individual horizons of hope and fantasy - oral rehydration therapy for instance.
