For now, we will focus on Marx, Weber, Durkheim and Du Bois.
You've taken A-Level Sociology - you know Marx's focus on the means of production, over-specialisation and so on, Weber's thoughts on ideas and the chaotic-ness of human beings, Durkheim's beliefs on institutions and predictable social facts and so on.

# Marx

He developed a distinctive theoretical approach to the study of society, influencing social and political events significantly, drawing attention to the significance of the economy and class conflict.

His political theory was limited, but his theory of history and his theory of how society works (especially Capitalism) was incredibly pertinent. Once you have Communism, then you don't need politics anymore.

## A short biography on Marx
1813-1883, Born in Trier and died in London.
Secularised, liberal, Jewish background, his father was a lawyer.

### Intellectual influences on Marx
* Hegel:
Dialectics - a term used by Hegel and Marx to refer to the use of the notion of inherent contradictions to explain historical change - how the Capitalist society sows the seeds of its own destruction.
Historicism - Karl Popper's term to denigrate Marx's concept of history, alluding to a particular approach to history that seeks to uncover alleged laws or wheel's of history in the hope of making prophecies.
* Feuerbach
Rejects any philosophy that regards the material realm as mere imperfect reflections of the spiritual world and he argues that philosophy should start with the finite material world
* Political Economy (Mill, Ricardo, Smith)
Marx agreed on a theory of Capitalism but rejected their specific case for a general theory: her argued that their concepts need to be taken as historically specific.
* French Utopian Socialism (Fourier)
Marx approves of their arguments in favour of equality, and the abolishment of private property but insists that we need to look at societal history to uncover laws.
He dislikes that they speculate about the future and envision this radical society whereas we need to analyse history properly to form conclusions into history.

## Historical Materialism

This is an approach to history that seeks to uncover laws of history with laws linked to the economy.

He creates a distinction between Unterbau (the economy, the base, the infrastructure) and the Uberbau (everything aside). We can carve up history in regards to the economy structure.

The economic mode, also known as the economic base, consists of the forces and relations of production (anything that enables people to control their surroundings and the rights, laws, obligations respectively).

The division of labour tends to mean that the forces of production increase, but eventually the relations of production start to inhibit the development of the forces of production (for instance, feudal relations inhibit the use of the steel mill).

This contradiction is also connected with social classes - between those who own the means of production and those who don't. Therefore we must move to a new mode of production. Another set of contradiction lies within the economic system - that each system has in-built inefficiency, that the rules start to make it difficult to be productive and efficient.

Essentially, Capitalism works up to a point: it can create huge amounts of wealth and innovation, but eventually a tension builds up among the forces and relations of production which causes a collapse.

## Theory of Alienation
The theory of alienation comes about from intense over-specialisation and division of labour.
Essentially, as society continues we begin to lose ourselves:

> [!quote] We become alienated from the object
> The object we create 'exists outside of him, independent and alien'
> *Marx, Economic and Philisophical Manuscript*

 > [!quote] We become alienated from our activities. 
 > The activity becomes 'alien and doesn't belong to him ... as an activity directed against himself, independent of him and not belonging to him' 
 > *Marx, Economic and Philisophical Manuscript*

 > [!quote] We become alienated from others. 
 > 'One man (sic) is alienated from another as each of them is alienated from the human essence.'
 > *Marx, Economic and Philisophical Manuscript*

Therefore, we become dehumanised. Everything that separates us from animal becomes cast aside. We essentially lose ourselves.

## Economic Theory

There is something intrinsically exploitative about Capitalism. His theory of exploitation relies on the two type of economic exchange - an exchange of goods without money or with money can have their path described as C-M-C whereas aim in pursuit of profit creates a path of M-C-M.

Total working day = necessary labour time + surplus labour time
Rates of exploitation = Surplus Labour Time divided by Necessary Labour Time

Therefore, Capitalism (which breeds competition) leads to strategies for profit: either increasing labour time or rather through technological improvement - both of which increases efficiency and creates immense exploitation.

As a consequence, we overproduce, the sheer efficiency means that consumers lose power, which in turn means less purchasing and eventually all of this overproduction results in an economic crisis.

In turn we move to...

## Communism

Marx is reluctant to describe this society.
However, production will be planned, new mode of production with collective means of production.
It follows that there will be an end of waste - no overproduction or unemployment.
This will be the end of exploitation as the worker will receive use-value minus what is necessary.
In the long run, we wouldn't need the state (in the short run, we will need a state to remove the conservative forces) but eventually Communism will spread so we don't need to protect each other against other states.
We will no longer be involved in narrow specialisation.

# Max Weber

In contrast to Marx, he developed a different account of the transition towards modern society focusing on nationalisation.
He rejected historical determinism and materialism.
He argued for methodological individualism and had a nuanced notion of social stratification (class, power, status)
He focused on neutrality (value-free sociology) and opts for the ethics of responsibilities versus of end.

He rejects historical materialism as he hates the idea of proposing a doctrine or dogma on how to approach the social world. Sometimes the economy has a massive impact on society but it may also *not*. He dislikes that there is a 'direction' in history as though we can prophesise, when history is a product of individual choice. If we want to understand the social world, we **must** understand individuals and we cannot understand society through empirical social sciences. For him, when we look at Marx, it is all conflated.

Weber would like to focus on class, status and power (as opposed to Marx's focus on class) that helps determine a person's position in society.

### A short biography on Weber
1864-1920
Bourgeois, liberal, protestant.
Harboured political ambitions but ended up as a professor of economics.

### Methodological consideration:
Methodenstreit: opposes positivism.
Positivists assume that the methods of the natural sciences can and should be applied to the social realm (social facts)
Hermeneutically inclined authors contend that the differences between the social and natural realm are such that the methods of the natural sciences are not applicable, that the social world is unique and more like an art form.

Weber takes a middle position, arguing for casual analysis. Verstehen, emotional interpretive understanding, is a middle way into understanding these places.

He makes an emphasis on the **ideal type**:
This starts from the observation that social and historical research draws on concepts that are regularly employed by 'lay people.'
Therefore, an ideal type refers to the essential features of a phenomenon (not an average).
It does not exist in reality but enables the researcher to compare different settings and to identify shifts through time - for example, studies into bureaucracy or populism must be done in its true form but that can be impossible, so we must instead approximate it.

### The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism

Observations:
* Parts of Western Europe and Asia were on par economically until the 13-14th Century of which Europe seems to take off.
* Areas in Western Europe that had become overwhelmingly Protestant seem to develop rational capitalism.
* Protestants tended to be more successful entrepreneurs and professionals, and vice versa.

Explanations:
Protestants rejected features of the Catholic church (the importance of the Pope, the religious figures led lives of luxury) so if we look at the emergence of rational capitalism, a time where we have Capitalist entrepreneurs we can see that a significant number of them were Protestants.
Weber came to a realization in his analysis of Calvinism.

Calvinism believed in work as a vocation where idleness is evil. God cannot be comprehended by people because they belong to the finite realm, so therefore at the moment of an individual's birth, God has decided whether or not they are elected.
This leads to 'salvation anxiety' as any doubt on an individual's part that he or she is elected is a sign of a lack of grace.
Therein, signs of the fact that we are elected such as material-success means that God has favoured us, so people then unconsciously look for signs for election, urging them to work hard.

This inner-worldly asceticism makes for a highly dynamic world-view, propelling rational Capitalism.

Weber is aware that other factors played a role in the development of rational Capitalism (for instance, a rational legal system).
This also played a part of the role of unintended consequences.

## Bureaucracy

Bureaucracies epitomise rationalization - highly efficient means for reaching a given goal.
Main features, using this ideal type:
* Hierarchy: orders from above
* Universal Rules
* Impersonal performance and public/private distinction
* Division of labour
* Appointment based on competence.

State bureaucracies were dangerous in a different way: their logic is different to that of patronage.
There is a danger to this: bureaucrats might adjust objectives based on outside pressures.
They are difficult to monitor because this requires expertise.

# Durkheim
He presented a theory of social evolution, a holistic theory of society.
He argued for a distinct sociological methodology of research and conceives of society as in need of social solidarity.

Biography:
1858-1917
Wrote during the third republic in France - a period of political turmoil and scandals.
Jewish background.
Initially wanted to become a Rabbi.
Enters the *Ecole Normale Superieure.*

## Influences:
### Auguste Comte
* Argued for Positivism
* Proposed the law of three stages (teleological, metaphysical and positivist stage)
* Classified reality according to degrees of complexity
* Defined his own proposal for 'sociology' - the culmination of history
* Political and industrial revolution have undermined the spontaneous order and can only be restored with the help of scientific steering.

Durkheim borrowed:
1. The notion that we need a scientific account of social phenomena
2. That sociological research will enable us to detect problems and solutions
3. That the social cannot be reduced to the sum of psychological features.

### Biology and Evolutionary Theory
He drew upon the biological analogy - treated societies as wholes (in the notion of social or societal needs and the notion of function), and saw societal evolution as in terms of increasing complexity (in differentiation and division of labour)

## Methodological Considerations
He wanted to set out an empirical science of sociology.
He criticised the *a priori* analysis in philosophy - the idea to let the facts speak for themselves.
Thus, sociology studies social facts: facts that are general, external and constraining.
We should treat these social facts as things, explaining them scientifically.

> [!info] What does this mean?
> Causal explanations: explain the emergence of social facts by other social facts
> Functional explanations: explain the persistence of social facts by the function they fulfil (holistic approach)

## Division of Labour
In this work he is trying to discuss the transition of a modern society.
Similar to biological systems, societies are becoming more complex and thus the division of labour is a response to the increase in population and density of population.
Non-differentiated societies rely on 'mechanical solidarity' based on a strong 'collective consciousness' - a strong, shared sense of right and wrong.

Differentiated societies like ours need 'organic solidarity' - no longer based on similarity but on interdependency. A world in which we have a weak collective consciousness. We are in transition - the absence of solidarity creates anomie.

## Summary:
To-do later.
