## Lecture information:

```ad-tldr
This topic will look at the need to adopt global, historically-connected sociological analysis. We will consider the ‘decolonial’ turn in sociology and the social science, zooming in on the concept of modernity/coloniality. We will then consider cases where such transnational, historical analysis is needed in the present day, including the climate, populism, and police brutality
```

How else can we understand these inequalities and interconnections by zooming out.

## Rethinking Modernity

[[Bharmbra]] (2008) *Rethinking Modernity*
- We come to think of modernity as a European phenomenon, whereby all achievements within the geographical space of Europe are seen to have emerged as a consequence of the endogenous efforts of European alone.
- [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]],  [[Emile Durkheim]] - they say that modernity is basically about Capitalism
- [[Anthony Giddens]] modernity has its roots in specific characteristics of European history with few parallels in prior periods - American Revolution, French Revolution, Capitalism all happens in the West.

There's something distinctive about that part of the world.
Most of the key theorists about Sociology are saying good and progressive things are happening in the **west**.

So we need to criticise that.

We need to understand this relationship between modernity and the idea of **bifurcation**, presenting a kind of history and progress and sociology and Capitalism where it (the world?) is divided into two.

[[Karl Marx]] just ignores Asia. One criticism he overlooks is how inequality happens - Marx's understanding of society. Who owns means of production? The transformation from Capitalism to what's next concerns itself with **public ownership** - he's assuming that in other parts of the world, there's no private property, there's no class struggle, there's no Capitalism. What if the base of class struggle? It's a process of industrialisation. Surplus value and alienation. He's saying that there are certain parts of society where this dynamic of class struggle doesn't exist: and because it doesn't exist, it is not that modern and important. He disregards the Asian mode of production.

[[Karl Marx]] argued that Western societies transitioned from feudalism into capitalism as we get a shift in the means of production (which were becoming increasing industrial) and an unequal ownership over these means of production which created the driving force of class antagonism between the workers and bourgeoisie ...

However, this is contrasted to what Marx called the "Asiatic mode of production" - there. Because of a lack of a class struggle and a state-centralised economy with no private ownership of land, society is in stagnation,

Additionally, Weber's analysis of the Protestant Ethic - what about other religions? Does Capitalism just not exist there?

In reality they're ignoring the **colonial global economy** - what we see as the institutions of capitalism, markets and corporations. What emerges in the West as a cause of colonialism and a kind of new type of work. So much of what we know of it is about a colonial global economy, what these miss is the colonial flow of capital that has created these conditions for progress.

Not just about colonialism and by the end of todays lecture, we cannot understand contemporary inequalities and the 'progress' of the 1800s without looking at the 1400s (1492). Don't just look at British imperial rule. There's something happening before that - what happened in 1492? Columbus. The discovery of America. 

Even prior to the age of European empires, you get a boom in European industries founded on colonial expansion:
- Virginia Company
- East India Company
- Lloyds Bank - coffee house became recognised as a place for obtaining marine insurance that could be used for slave ships.

You would not have capitalist exploitation in the factories of Manchester (Marx) without the materials that were taken from the colonies themselves.

Gilroy - 85% of cotton taken from plantation slavery. 

As [[Franz Fanon]] put it: "**Europe is literally the creation of the Third World. The Wealth that smothers her is that which was stolen from the underdeveloped peoples.**"

Eric Williams in Capitalism and Slavery: slavery and colonialism, "it provided the sugar for the tear and coffee cups of the Western world ... The rising capitalist class was becoming used to the idea of sacrificing human life to the deity of increased production." (5)

What exactly is **modernity**? On whose back was modernity furthered.
Let us look at the contradiction at the heart of the "modern" world - challenge the analytic bifurcation, but an interdependence.
What is **modernity hiding**? - violence, a colonial past, something that helps us understand the importance of interconnectedness.
We study and **analyse **inequalities in the context of these **interconnections** (global and transnational), violence of modernity, and coloniality.
```

```ad-example
title: French Revolution and Haitian revolution
French revolution - men are born and remain free and equal in rights.
France was still a violent empire and put a series of law that prohibited *gens de *couleur* and barred them from citizenship.
Similarly the American constitution guaranteed the protection of individual rights for all ... except people of colour.
```

```ad-example
title: The US and Haiti: labour and resistance
First successful slave revolt. How many of us were taught about this? 

Both these constitutions highlighed a contradiction between universal declaration and particularized application. In both cases we see the 'subaltern' force a confrontation between this contradiction.
- In Saint Domingue we get the Haitian revolution where anti-colonists withdrew labour, forcing abolition of enslavement across major coloines in 1794 and later independence from France (in 1804).
- In the US, [[W, E. B. Du Bois]] points out that it is not taught of, not covered.
```

There is no simple 'western modernity', there is modernity and coloniality. [[Walter Mignolo]] argues that: there is no modernity.

Why use the term coloniality? Beyond political control - because colonialism is political relations between different regions where one region sets up administration in another part of the world. Coloniality exists when political relations do not exist.

Decolonisation does not necessarily get rid of power relations because these relations are not just economic. They are ontological (hierarchies of being), epistemic, political, and symbolic.

## Modernity and Coloniality

An "us" vs "them", "modern" vs "traditional" - assumes no relation between societies. There is rather an interdependence.

```ad-quote
title: Julian Go's work (2016)
“this analytical bifurcation is particularly palpable in the repression of imperial history and colonial domination (pp 105). It separates metropole from colony when in practice they were not always so separate.” (pp 105-106). 
“If the imperial episteme’s law of division cuts the world up into separate entities, a postcolonial approach would start by reconnecting the separated parts.” (pp 111). 

```

```ad-quote
Maldonado-Torres, 2007: 243: “Coloniality is different from colonialism. Colonialism denotes a political and economic relation in which the sovereignty of a nation or a people rests on the power of another nation, which makes such nation an empire. Coloniality, instead, refers to long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of colonialism, but that define culture, labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge production well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations. Thus, coloniality survives colonialism.” 
```

```ad-quote
Grosfoguel, 2007: 219: “One of the most powerful myths of the twentieth century was the notion that the elimination of colonial administrations amounted to the decolonization of the world […] Although ‘colonial administrations’ have been almost entirely eradicated and the majority of the periphery is politically organized into independent states, non-European people are still living under crude European/Euro-American exploitation and domination. The old colonial hierarchies of European versus non-Europeans remain in place and are entangled with the ‘international division of labor’ and accumulation of capital at a world-scale”
```

## Neo-colonialism and capitalism

Anti-colonial intellectuals thus recast ‘advanced capitalism’ as neo-colonialism.

Nkrumah (1971), for instance, points out, upon independence Nigeria became a rapidly growing exporter of petroleum throughout the 1960 s, but the profits for such exports were mostly reaped by the British company Shell-BP; similar realities are captured across a wide-range of examples in the post-independence era including Western finance controlling gold and diamond mining industry in South Africa.

North America-headquartered investors accounted for 42% of all African venture capital deals in the last five years, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. Of the top 10 African-based startups that received the highest amount of venture capital in Africa last year, eight were led by foreigners. 

In Kenya, only 6% of start-ups that received more than $1 m in 2019 were led by locals.

```ad-example
title: The Coloniality of power: economic/political
Du Bois: a ‘change in method of control […] but not real change in the facts or rigor of results’ […] she must pay prices determined in London and New York and sell for prices set in San Francisco and Paris. She must produce and manufacture not [] what her people need but what Europe and America want and will buy […] New York dictates the price of ‘Cuban sugar, Haitian coffee and Dominican products’ while ‘Tin from Bolivia [] coffee from Brazil, gold from South Africa, copper from Rhodesia, and uranium from Congo are all under foreign control and the native populations have their income and way of life dictated by powers outside their political control [thus producing a] new phase of Colonial Imperialism’.

- In 2020 ‘Debt burden of the least developed nations rises to $744 billion’ (so are they really ‘least developed’ or instead underdeveloped?).

- IMF and WB: Think of the circle of aid industry: what is exchanged in borrowing aid. Think of commodity consumption in the north (takes commodities from South); IMF and WB and the programmes they organise: their idea is that the only way to grow is by lowering tarrifs and reject protectionism and embrace freetrade. IMF and World Bank support north to get commodities from the south 

- Today, the Global North drains from the South commodities worth $2.2 trillion per year, in Northern prices.

- For every dollar of aid the South receives, they lose $14 in drain through unequal exchange alone.
```

```ad-example
title: Coloniality of knowledge
- ‘…impact of colonization on the different areas of knowledge production’ (Maldonado-Torres, 2007).
- The coloniality of knowledge thus links ontology and epistemology. 
- When you think of capitalism, you think of West; when democracy, you think of French revolution (whereas as we have seen important are also other movements of self-determination).
- Erasing systems of knowledge from the South ‘involves the destruction of the social practices and the disqualification of the social agents that operate according to such knowledges’ living in the South (Santos 2014: 153). 
```

```ad-example
title: Coloniality of Being
Some are “being” some are not; some are human, some are not: the hierarchies of being.

Gender and sexuality: transgender people criminalised under the Criminal Tribes Act 1871. A new hierarchy of gender and sexual relations, a new order of “being” (still continues…) 

Eg: black people thought closer to being to animals (eugenics); Indians (non-Christians) thought not to have souls (only Christians)

‘. . . colonialism is not simply content to impose its rule upon the present and the future of a dominated country. Colonialism is not satisfied merely with holding a people in its grip and emptying the native’s brain of all form and content. By a kind of perverse logic, it turns to the past of the oppressed people, and distorts it, disfigures and destroys it. (Frantz Fanon 1961)’ 
```

## A sociology for global and transnational inequalities

Beyond methodological nationalism.
- Go (2009: 783) as the process of ‘understanding a “society” […] by looking only within the spatial confines of […] the particular nation-state.’ 
- Go (2018: 447): Empire was always a transnational and global process [...] and as the dynamics and relations of empire always transcended the confines of parochial national boundaries, so too should our sociological analyses. 

Global and transnational inequalities are relational across time, across space across concepts

```ad-example
title: Militarization of police (US)
- Go (2020) shows that what we typically associate with being a contemporary practice of national racial ordering has historical, transnational roots.
- The tactics used by the militarized police – such as the creation of mobile squads and police intelligence divisions – derived from the US’ military practices in their colonies, particularly in the Philippines war. 
- In this regard, Go’s (2020) decolonial approach creates not only a temporal link between a contemporary issue of police militarization with its historical origins, but also a transnational link between ‘racism at home’ with the US’ ‘imperialism abroad’.

```

```ad-example
title: How English is tea? Identity, Empire, and opium trade
- How British empire started opium trade, made it grow in India, to exchange with China (for tea), to redress trade imbalance. 
- Tea was expensive, formerly paid for in silver, but needed new commodity to pay for: opium (poppy production in India)-– the adverse impact it still has on the regions that grew opium (Bengal, Bihar, of present day India). (contemporary inequalities)
- And how America’s most powerful families and institutions were also involved in this opium trade

‘I am the sugar at the bottom of the English cup of tea.I am the sweet tooth, the sugar plantations that rotted generations of English children’s teeth. There are thousands of others beside me that are, you know, the cup of tea itself. Because they don’t grow it in Lancashire, you know. Not a single tea plantation exists within the United Kingdom. This is the symbolization of English identity – I mean, what does anybody in the world know about an English person except that they can’t get through the day without a cup of tea? Where does it come from? Ceylon – Sri Lanka, India. That is the outside history that is inside the history of the English. **There is no English history without that other history**.’ (Hall, 1991: 48-9)
