# Lecture Notes

Difficulty in a clear conception of race:

E.g. Brazil, Solomon Islands

Pre-revolution Haiti had more than 100 different categories of race

Independence constitution of 1804 declared land could only be owned by “Blacks and Mulattoes”, but “blacks” included white women who had married Haitians and Germans and Poles who had helped to fight

Mexico in late 1700s: “castas” regime; over 100 categories of race depending on a supposed “mixture” between indigenous, Spanish, and African “blood”

Independence declaration in 1810 outlawed racial categorising

The Making of Race

Traced to 1492 and Columbus’ “discovery” of the Americas?

Necessity to categorise colonised populations

Races as distinct types of human beings; became a scientific desire as well

Supposed differing mental capacities

Explicit endorsements of colonial rule; from all sides of the political spectrum, including Marx

Critical Race Theory

First wave: Crenshaw, Bell

Initially concerned with the illusion of progress for African Americans post-Civil Rights

Crenshaw - ‘We began to think of our project as uncovering how law was a constitutive element of race itself: in other words, how law constructed race’

E.g. Cheryl Harris’ Whiteness as Property

Milliken vs Bradley 1974 - rejection of a remedy for school segregation in Detroit

Plaintiffs must prove that segregation was ‘the result of discriminatory actions intentionally and invidiously conducted or authorised by school officials’

Intersectionality

DeGraffenreid vs GM; black women were being discriminated against

‘This lawsuit must be examined to see if it states a cause of action for race discrimination, sex discrimination, or alternatively either, but not a combination of both’

Different inequalities are constituted through each other

Bonilla-Silva

‘After a society becomes racialised, a set of social relations and practices based on racial distinctions develops at all societal levels’

‘Therein lies the secret of racial structures and racial inequality the world over. They exist because they benefit members of the dominant race’

1. The social construction of racial groups

2. The placement of racial groups into a racial hierarchy

3. The unequal distribution of resources (e.g. economic, cultural political, symbolic, organisational etc) across this racial hierarchy

Methodological implications: use of racial attitude surveys

Racial ideologies to do more with perception than deception

Racial ideologies important for the reproduction of structural social relations

Racialised Emotions

Bonilla-Silva: ‘I am not alone in feeling race - whether consciously or not, we all feel race because the category is produced not just “objectively” but subjectively. Much like class and gender, race cannot come to life without being infused with emotions, thus, racialised actors feel the emotional weight of their categorical location’

1. Racialised emotions help generate racialised group subjectivities and interests

2. Emotions serve as a basis for transmitting racial ideologies

3. Different emotions are given different levels of legitimacy and recognition within the racial structure

Ray - Racialised organisations are “racial structures” which connect ‘organisational rules to social and material resources’

Meghji - racialised nature of football; “physicality” of Black players

No praise given to Black players in relation to their cognition or character
