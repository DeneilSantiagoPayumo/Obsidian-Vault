Breaking with the classics: postmodernity - Lyotard
Reflexive modernity - Beck and Giddens
Society of singularity - Beckwitz
High speed society - Rose
Liquid modernity - Bauman

So we've got theories of modernity:
- Karl Marx (historical materialism, capitalism alienation, communism)
- Max Weber (methodological individualism, Protestantism, rationalisation)
- Emile Durkheim (Functionalism, division of labour, problems of integration)
- W.E.B Du Bois (Marxism, colour line, veil, double consciousness, racial inequality and colonialism)

Is the present different? More recap:

Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer - the docile working class, people who want to be distracted and entertained.
- Book: Enlightenment and Despair
- Culture Industry
- Set Formats
- Passivity

Jean Baudrillard:
- Book: Simulacra and Simulation - images, copies of the real thing, and if you look at advertising or social media and how we post on Instagram... how we struggle to differentiate between that and the real thing.
- Postmodernism
- Simulacra
- Hyper-reality

Shoshana Zuboff:
- Book: Surveillance Capitalism - came out with this book only a few years ago, her idea that Capitalism has entered a new era or phase
- Gathering and processing private experiences
- New business model
- New forms of control

## Lecture notes:
## Zygmunt Bauman

Book: *Modernity and the Holocaust*
Builds on Weber
Against widely held views - holocaust as pre-modern or unique.
Instead, modernity has potential for large scale evil.
Modernity and the nation state.

Bureaucracy - training for instrumental rationality, not substantive rationality
Physical and psychological distance towards effects.

Dichotomies: in/out, citizen/nazi, indifference towards ambivalence.

He shows some of the pernicious features of modernity about the dark side of modernity and focuses particularly on the holocaust, the genocide, Nazi Germany.

The nation states in principle will try to provide resources, social and economic powers. There's a kind of equality embedded in the modern nation state. However, the other nation states comes with the other state - very clear notions of who is 'in' and who is 'out'. Families who are not quite German, Jewish people, and so Bauman argues that you get this level of intolerance towards that kind of ambiguity, an intolerance between the nation state.

The other thing about the modern nation state is that they draw on large bureaucratic systems for their organisation. This is Weber's impact on Bauman - that means that you have a lot of people employed in those kind of organisations, trained to think in terms of instrumental rationality.

You're disassociated from the consequences for your action. You can be in an organisation that is pursuing highly efficiently highly rational goals, and you think in terms of instrumental rationality, and somehow psychologically and physically you are disassociated from this notion. The notion of individual possibility is reduced to inhuman.

Bauman's argument - there's this whole process of the modern nation state however beneficial it might be, it's not a story of that, it's a story of the highly potentiality endeavour.

## Lyotard

Jean François Lyotard’s post-modernity
• French philosopher, (1924-1998)
• Book: The Postmodern Condition; A Report on Knowledge
• Abandonment of meta-narratives (e.g. knowledge, progress)
• Competing knowledge claims
• Multiplicty of ‘language games’
• Science loses its superior epistemic status
• Relativism?

## Ulrich Beck's Risk Society

German sociologist, Prof Munich/LSE (1944-2015)
• Book: Risk Society
• First and second modernity
• First modernity:
• faith in science and technology
• in order to control our environment
• Second modernity:
• awareness of limitations of the first phase: unintended effects
• risks: negative effects produced by people
• applicable to everyone (to some extent)
• no geographical boundaries
• solutions cannot be found at national level
• cosmopolitanism

## Anthony Gidden's reflexive modernity

British sociologist, Prof Cambridge, Director LSE, Third Way (1938-)
• Books: Consequences of Modernity and Modernity and Self-Identity
• Late/high modernity
• External vs manufactured risks – runaway world
• Reflexivity: we regularly reflect on how we live (e.g. marriage)
• De-traditionalisation
• Time-space distanciation and globalisation
• Disembedding and trust:
-  symbolic tokens (e.g. money) “Media of interchange which can be ‘passed around’ without regard to the specific characteristics of individuals or groups that handle them at any particular juncture”
-  expert systems: “Systems of technical accomplishment or professional expertise that organise large areas of the material and social environments in which we live today”

## Andreas Reckwitz’s society of singularities

• German sociologist, Prof at the Humboldt University Berlin (1970-)
• Book: The Society of Singularities
• Industrial capitalism: the general, standardisation, repetition
• Aesthetic or cultural capitalism: singularity, uniqueness, creativity
• Multiple causes of move towards singularity:
• cultural capitalism
• digital technologies
• new middle class (new values: self-realisation)
• Examples:
• US students apply to university with a unique story-line
• products marketed with a unique story-line
• work as expression
• holiday as individual, authentic experience
• unique stories/profiles on social media

## Hartmut Rosa’ society of social acceleration
• German sociologist, Professor at Jena (1965-)
• Book: Social Acceleration; A New Theory of Modernity
• Modern society characterised by ‘dynamic stabilization’
“… when it systematically requires growth, innovation, and acceleration for
Its structural reproduction and to maintain its socioeconomic and
Institutional status quo…”
• Dynamic stabilisation applicable in different areas:
e.g. economy, art, science
• Accelerated time and shrinking present
• Legitimate claims on our time budget keep on rising
• Let’s take the case of Linda!

Acceleration - continued
• Technology is meant to save time?
• Technology feeds the shrinking of time: e.g. emails, phone, etc.
• it increases hypothetical options: e.g. I can be contactable when away from
My desk
• it converts these hypotheticals into real options: e.g. I am contactable
• Hence search for refuge: e.g. digital detox holidays off-grid
• Social stratification and de-synchronisation
• resources to speed up? e.g. tutoring
• educated professional class: internalised pressures
• low level work: external pressures
• the excluded (ill, unemployed)

## Acceleration
• De-synchronization: two systems operating at different speed
• Ecological crisis (e.g. deforestation because we cut threes as rate too
High for its natural reproduction)
• Political crisis: democratic deliberation and decision-making is slower
than societal developments, undermining its legitimacy (e.g. Ukraine)
• Economic crisis (e.g. financial transactions go extremely fast in
Comparison to the production of goods to which they refer)

## Return to Zygmunt Bauman !
• Book: Liquid Modernity
• Individualisation vs solidarity: people on the move (work, relations)
• Consumption vs morality: pursuit of the new, self-concept and self-
Worth related to consumption, false freedom, insignificant choices
• Instability vs fixity: Ongoing need to change and adjust (no stable
Jobs)
• Uncertainty vs predictability: future remains uncertain
See also Richard Sennett’s book The Corrosion of Character; The Personal
Consequences of Work in the New Capitalism
• Insecurity vs security: anxiety
