Lecture - Power, Politics & Society
Part of the Political Sociology Module.

Why isn’t everyone always revolting, if things are so awful?
## What is political sociology and why does it exist?
Not a huge difference but there are nuanced stylistic differences
[[Bonikowski]] - ‘Politics is a struggle for power - power over access to and the distribution of resources, over personal and collective status, and over the ability to define legitimate categories of thought’
Political science typically focuses on formal institutions and acts of governing
[[Clemens]] - Political sociology also focus on institutions, but specifically that they ‘have been built up through systems of social relations and cultural understanding’

### Political sociology questions:

1. Ideological and demographic transitions
2. Right-wing populist ideology
3. Ethnic conflict over national identity, economic resources
4. Prejudice and racism

## Power - Definitions & Dimensions:
The one-dimensional view:
[[Max Weber]] - ‘Power is the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability rests’
If person B resists the power of person A successfully…

[[Dahl]] - Who Governs? Democracy and Power in an American City
‘The participants with the greatest proportion of successes out of the total number of successes were then considered to be the most influential’

Power is:
1. Distributed across multiple individuals or groups (pluralist view of power)
2. Revealed through observable actions and decisions (behaviourism)
3. Exercised in direct, manifest conflicts between competing goals or interests

#### The two-dimensional view:
[[Bachrach]] and [[Baratz]] -
As long as A has control over the parameters/choices, ‘B is prevented, for all practical purposes, from bringing to the fore’

‘Nondecision is a decision that results in suppression or thwarting of a latent or manifest challenge’
‘Second face’ of power is far more covert. Power to limit the range of possible decisions precedes any observable decision (non-behaviourist)

Revolved not only round decision-making, but also nondecision-making

Nondecisions mean that certain “potential issues” never make it onto the political agenda

#### The three-dimensional view:

[[Lukes]] - ‘the most effective and insidious use of power is to prevent…conflict from arising in the first place’
“A may exercise power over B by getting him to do what he does not want to do, but he also exercised power over him by influencing, shaping, or determining his very wants” – Lukes 1974
Shapes perception in such a way that people accept their role in things.
Also the most discrete form of power.

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s alternative View of Power:
- Power ‘is never the property of an individual; it belongs to a group and remains in existence only so long as the group keeps together’

- ‘When we say of someone that he is “in power”, we actually refer to him being empowered by a certain number of people’

Arendt and Parsons:
Power as a system property (a quality of a collective)
Focus on ‘power to’
- 
Weber, Dahl and Lukes: - Power as relational dynamic (power within social relationships)
Focus on ‘power over’

## The Sources of Social Power:

## Marxist Perspective:
Economic power
[[Jessop]] - power relations are ‘manifestations of a specific mode or configuration of class domination rather than a purely interpersonal phenomenon lacking deeper foundations in the social structure’

Power flows from positions within the class structure, which is defined by control over major economic resources (i.e. the forms of capital) and employment relations

[[Mann]]’s four sources of social power:
1. Economic (class dimensions, but also segments between classes e.g. a warehouse shift manager)
2. Military
3. Ideological (both religious and ideological)
4. Political (administrative power of states)
