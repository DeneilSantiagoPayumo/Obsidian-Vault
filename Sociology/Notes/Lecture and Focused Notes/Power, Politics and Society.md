Lecture - Power, Politics & Society
Part of the Political Sociology Module.

Why isn’t everyone always revolting, if things are so awful?
## What is political sociology and why does it exist?
Not a huge difference but there are nuanced stylistic differences
[[Bonikowski]] - ‘Politics is a struggle for power - power over access to and the distribution of resources, over personal and collective status, and over the ability to define legitimate categories of thought’
Political science typically focuses on formal institutions and acts of governing
[[Clemens]] - Political sociology also focus on institutions, but specifically that they ‘have been built up through systems of social relations and cultural understanding’

### Political sociology questions:

1. Ideological and demographic transitions
2. Right-wing populist ideology
3. Ethnic conflict over national identity, economic resources
4. Prejudice and racism

## Power - Definitions & Dimensions:
The one-dimensional view:
[[Max Weber]] - ‘Power is the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability rests’
If person B resists the power of person A successfully…

[[Dahl]] - Who Governs? Democracy and Power in an American City
‘The participants with the greatest proportion of successes out of the total number of successes were then considered to be the most influential’

Power is:
1. Distributed across multiple individuals or groups (pluralist view of power)
2. Revealed through observable actions and decisions (behaviourism)
3. Exercised in direct, manifest conflicts between competing goals or interests

#### The two-dimensional view:
[[Bachrach]] and [[Baratz]] -
As long as A has control over the parameters/choices, ‘B is prevented, for all practical purposes, from bringing to the fore’

‘Nondecision is a decision that results in suppression or thwarting of a latent or manifest challenge’
‘Second face’ of power is far more covert. Power to limit the range of possible decisions precedes any observable decision (non-behaviourist)

Revolved not only round decision-making, but also nondecision-making

Nondecisions mean that certain “potential issues” never make it onto the political agenda

#### The three-dimensional view:

[[Lukes]] - ‘the most effective and insidious use of power is to prevent…conflict from arising in the first place’
“A may exercise power over B by getting him to do what he does not want to do, but he also exercised power over him by influencing, shaping, or determining his very wants” – Lukes 1974
Shapes perception in such a way that people accept their role in things.
Also the most discrete form of power.

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s alternative View of Power:
- Power ‘is never the property of an individual; it belongs to a group and remains in existence only so long as the group keeps together’

- ‘When we say of someone that he is “in power”, we actually refer to him being empowered by a certain number of people’

Arendt and Parsons:
Power as a system property (a quality of a collective)
Focus on ‘power to’
- 
Weber, Dahl and Lukes: - Power as relational dynamic (power within social relationships)
Focus on ‘power over’

## The Sources of Social Power:

## Marxist Perspective:
Economic power
[[Jessop]] - power relations are ‘manifestations of a specific mode or configuration of class domination rather than a purely interpersonal phenomenon lacking deeper foundations in the social structure’

Power flows from positions within the class structure, which is defined by control over major economic resources (i.e. the forms of capital) and employment relations

[[Mann]]’s four sources of social power:
1. Economic (class dimensions, but also segments between classes e.g. a warehouse shift manager)
2. Military
3. Ideological (both religious and ideological)
4. Political (administrative power of states)

The first part of this lecture revisited power. The notes are transcribed below:

What do we mean by the terms social relation and social structure?
We have a person. We know *nothing* about this person - we don't know their gender, race, income, so on and so forth. They are just a person and we've assigned no socially significant content yet. 

There is another person and we know nothing about them. Without knowing the content of their relationship we don't know about how power is exercised.

Let's assign some social roles: what about the social role between the worker and the boss? We know that they're hierarchically related. In this relationship the worker (ignoring the fact they may be in unions) will have no relationships.

What if the boss had power over three workers? Well, the same example applies - the boss can still exercise the same power. We know however that bosses typically exercise power over workers in many situations. A social structure is just a repeated pattern of social relations.

In this social structure we can refer to people who are in similar positions. We call this then structural equivalence. There may also be investors and capitalists, and they have a social relation to this structure. That is repeated and there are capitalists everywhere. These capitalists are owed power to the state. This is an example of structural power.

The working class however can go on labour strikes and capitalists can use instrumental power in capital strike against the strike. Social relations must be maintained before society, as it is, breaks down.

```ad-quote
title: Georg Simmel (1909)
"The large systems and the super-individual organizations that customarily come to mind when we think of society, are **nothing but immediate interactions** that occur among men constantly, every minute, but that have become **crystalized as permanent fields, as autonomous phenomena.** As they crystalize, **they attain their own existence and their own laws and may even confront or oppose spontaneous interaction itself.**"
```

Once these social relations become so general over time, it produces a structure that constrains our ability to invent social relations over time. It's difficult for us to completely innovate or walk away from these.

In Crowley's own terms: socials structures are relatively stable patterns of social relations that endure over time. They are both caused by and a cause of repeated social interactions.

Position in social structure **conditions but does not determine** action - it can be constraining or enabling but it cannot determine our actions. We cannot look at somebody's position and infer exactly what they are going to do.
