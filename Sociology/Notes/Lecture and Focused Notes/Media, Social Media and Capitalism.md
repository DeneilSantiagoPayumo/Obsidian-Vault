# McLuhan and the Electronic Age
## Marshall McLuhan

He studied at Cambridge (wow!), became Professor at University of Toronto.
He specialised in English Literature and wrote about popular culture, television and advertising.

Core ideas:
1. The medium is the message
2. The media are extensions of our human senses
3. Effects of the media: sense ratios
4. Distinction between hot and cool media
5. Three communication ages: the oral age, literature age and electronic age
6. Comparison with [[Harold Innis]] - societies that rely on time-biased media, media-based media.

### The medium is the message
His point is that when you think about media in a broad sense of the world, as in  the kind of technologies of which we communicate and engage with through the world, the specific content of what is communicated is not really very important, what's more important is that the technology that we use and makes possible for communication.

For example, the print industry enabled the distribution of written texts across a large landscape, reaching a huge number of people. Some historians (like Anderson) argue that nationalism had a lot to do with the print industry. There are other historians who have pointed out other religious transformations had to do with the print industry.

Arguing what relevance a specific book is, is in totality, an irrelevant question. What is distinctive is the technology - at a time where McLuhan was writing about this, there was a lot of debate of certain programs specifically on children. This was the wrong question to ask as what's at stake is the technology. For him, the electronic age has radically transformed the ways in which we engaged with the world.


### The media as extension of our human senses
For the electronic devices that we use to communicate with each other, by using media, our senses are engaged and that means that because our senses are engaged, that certain senses are more engaged than others. This changes the ways in which we engage and interact with the world.

We have engaged with the visual more so than the past.


### Hot and cool media:
He also makes a distinction with hot and cool media. Take a lecture for example. In the lecture's case, you don't have to make too much of a contribution to get the information. For him, that is 'hot media' - rich with information and we don't need to make much of an effort. Whereas, if we make a seminar, we have something called a 'cool' , we consume and engage with what we consume and so that's connected to the specific technologies.

### The ages:
The oral age - transmitted through speech, and we transmit important information by conveying it orally. The literature figure we use books. The electronic age we talk and communicate through electronic devices. 

### Time and media biased:
In the context of, say, a village with an elder, we have a person with authority who speaks and has the authority to be listened to. Therein, the information that is transmitted is strongly relied on time-bias, passed down through generations. If we have a society that where we tweet things, it's likely to be picked up and commented on across the world. In this idea, this is an example of 'space biased medium'

### The electronic age
Space and time are no longer barriers for communication.
We live in a 'global village'
People are becoming more 'tribal' - what does he mean? This means, before the advent of the internet, social media is becoming quite divisive and we have been swept away by the constant basis of these global trends that capture people's imaginations.
The notion of privacy has changed - people share their ideas, emotions and personal thoughts have been changed.
The distinction between the consumer and producer has become blurred.

### Evaluation
There is an idea of a lack of clarity.
There  is an idea of technological determinism and obfuscation.

## Jean Baudrillard
He is a French philosopher and sociologist.
He distinguished between modernity and postmodernity.

He was a neo-Marxist critique that distinguished between modernity and postmodernity.

For example, Marx would discuss the production of goods - but in advanced capitalism, capitalism has moved into new areas. For instance, it is in the basis of the postmodern condition - the creation of images, copies of reality.

This is *the hyper reality.*

The simulacra attempt to present images that are copies of the new thing, pushing cars and clothing as ideas of a perfect lifestyle. If you were to think about social media and how people post perfect representations of their lifestyle, potentially doctored, these are copies of the real thing. Simulacras.

As a result of this, we are surrounded by copies of the real thing. We cannot distinguish between what is real and what is **not** real.

This is hyperreality, where we cannot make the distinguish between what is real and what is not real.

# The Culture Industry and Beyond

## The Frankfurt School
They are a group of neo-Marxist scholars, originally based in the Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt.
They were interested in the relationship between Capitalism and Culture.
Some of the names: Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse
Interdisciplinary work
Experience of Nazi Germany and its propaganda
Confronted with the entertainment industry.

Some of the prophecies dictated by Marx had been wrong: but for this school, it had focused on how Capitalism and the production of culture changed in the early 20th century.

They were struck by the entertainment and culture industry. They wanted to argue that in this particular context, Capitalism is doing something very different: in a sense, Marx was talking about tangible products but here Capitalism is producing *cultural* products.

The notion of culture industry:
* Rationalization of culture
* Culture industry - not mass culture
* Capitalism permeates the production of culture
* Contrasts with previous notions of culture
* Large corporate organisations
* Cost-benefits calculations
* Standardisation of the product
* Distraction rather than authentic engagement
* Passivity and political non-engagement.

This is why we get sequels of films, or the over-production of certain genres like rom-coms.
They are distractions and make you deliberately passive, this kind of culture leading to a fall in political engagement and is part in passing of the way in which Capitalism has been able to create a relatively docile workforce.

### Criticisms

Hypodermic needle theory - that the media injects certain details and messages into you and you absorb it passively.

Some research shows otherwise:
1. Selective reception: (See Leon Festinger, a theory of Cognitive Dissonance) and Joseph Klapper's selective exposure theory (notion of the echo chamber for comparison).
2. Indirect effect: Katz and Lazersfeld's Personal Influence: their notions of 'two step flow of communication' and 'opinion leaders' based on empirical research.

We interpret the media by relying on a set of assumptions that we already have, drawing upon these assumptions to interpret the world. This means in practice that we tend to disregard information that do not align, that causes us to question this validity, we are a bit more conservative than what we are willing to accept. We tend to believe the validity of what we believe.

The two-step flow of communication: people in the forum are not influenced by the media, but historically they have authority 'opinion leaders', people we trust to have certain views about politics that can be trusted, people rely on these figures that they know rather than advertising and so on. These figures could be anyone: family, friends, teachers, so on and so forth. Opinion leaders tend to be people we know personally. What this means is that we can't simply say, as Adorno and Horkheimmer tend to say, is that the media has a straightforward effect on us. In other words, we actively interpret (with the help of others) even if there's a discrepancy behind how we interpret and what.

#### Reception Theory
Relevant article:; Hall's 'Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse'
Against 'mass communication model' moving away from effects on people:
* Meaning is not determined by sender: there can be a discrepancy between what was intended to be the message and how it was received by the audience
* Message is not transparent: the message will have to be interpreted by the audience
* Audience is not passive: interpretation is an active process

Distinction between encoding and decoding:

Three types of decoding:
* Dominant-hegemonic decoding
* Negotiated decoding
* Oppositional decoding

# Media, social media and digital capitalism

### Platform capitalism: preliminaries ([[Media, Social Media and Capitalism]]) and ([[Smicek, Nick Platform Capitalism, Cambridge, Polity Press 2016||Nick Smicek]])

Related concepts: platform capitalism, surveillance capitalism, gig economy, collarative economy, big data capitalism, digital capitalisms

```ad-tldr
title: Definition of platform capitalism
A form of capitalism that draws on a digital infrastructure that enables at least two groups of people to communicate - suppliers and consumers, people who post/read and advertisers.
```

Main features of platform capitalism:
##### Centrality of data
The focus here is on extraction, management, processing and dissemination of data
(Uber generating data from consumers and so on)
##### Network effects
Network effects are important: the sheer number of users is crucial to the extraction and processing of the data.
##### Importance of rapid growth
This means that companies can grow very quickly
Also aided by the fact that they don't need any factories
##### First mover advantage
Which leads nicely into...
##### Monopolisation
A tendency to buy other companies because data gathering is the main business
##### Cross-subsidisation
Whilst one aspect of the business reduces the price of a good or service, the other part of a business increases its income.
For instance, you may be able to join Facebook for free but increasingly advertising helps with this.
##### Just an empty space
Whilst often presenting themselves as intermediary, just an empty space for people to use, they set the rules of the game.
Uber doesn't just create space for drivers and customers to meet, they use data to predict where demand will be and adjusts prices accordingly.

### Various forms of platform capitalism
For example:
* Platforms that provide platforms or that provide tools for other platforms: the Internet, Apple IOS and so on.
* Advertising platforms (classic examples including Google and Facebook), linked to surveillance capitalism; our activities are monitored because those data can be stored
* Platforms mediating work - LinkedIn
* Lean platforms like Uber.

##### Pros:
Greater efficiency
Great competition
Access to new or underutilised services

##### Critiques:
Employees are left without protection
Precarity - often left on zero-hour contract
Absence of protection and hygiene
Asymmetric information about and power over customers
Digital market manipulation

# Surveillance Capitalism

## Michel Foucault#
He was a French historian and theorist.
He introduced the concept of the society of the spectacle and surveillance and argued we live in the society of the Spectacle.

### Notion of power:
Everywhere - not in the hands of a central agency or someone.
Circulates - not just imposed from above
It produces and influences - not merely a negative influence
It is intertwined with knowledge.

People tend to think of power as with someone that holds power over others. Power is something that is embedded in society and circulates through us in ways that we don't notice.

It flows through a particular social organisation for instance: people when they think about power, they see it in opposition to knowledge. In reality, if you look in practice, knowledge is intertwined with new forms of power.

### Genealogy:
He presents a theory of the past to influence the present, like Nietzsche's conceptions of good and evil.
What appears to be universal or fixed is the product of contingencies
What appears to be innocuous is tainted by power struggles.

What we take to be universal is thought to be variable. Another concepts of practices that appear to be innocuous, their origins have to do with power: in other words, Genealogy is a way of destabilizing the present through historical research.

#### Discipline and Punish I

**Society of the Spectacle**
Sovereign power
Focus on the body
Public display
Fear / deterrence

**Movement away from the Society of the Spectacle**
Concerns about social order
Utilitarianism.

What we have in those days is a society of spectacle. It symbolises sovereign power, its target of the bottom - a public display meant to instil fear. Early politicians questioned this particular system because there were issues around social order and often people would side with the victim and because the public display was connected to sovereign power, people would use the events to express their anger at authorities. It often lead to riots and disorders.

People started thinking about new ways of implementing social order. They started thinking about reforming it.

#### Discipline and Punish II
This is where the society of surveillance comes into play.

**Society of surveillance**
Disciplinary power
Focus on mind/soul
Internalisation
Pprivate
Reform

**Panopticon**
An architectural device
Prisons, military organisations, asylums, schools
Record-keeping
Self-correction

The panopticon is a general principle.

There is a general occupation with organizing space and time - with space, you get the famous panopticon tower where the prisoners can know that they're being watched, and therefore monitoring themselves. With rational organization of time, every second of the day is laid out: there is a clear instruction of what needs to be done and when. People with this kind of discipline will become reformed individuals.

The Panoptican is a genuine principle

### Michael Power - Audit Society
This concept was introduced by Michael Power who argued multiple things: that state funded organisations like schools and hospitals became monitored and their performances were quantified in relation to specific, set targets.

These organisations received sanctions or financial compensation depending on how well they've formed.

Often, there is a display of the ranking available to pretty much everybody.

This audit culture is part of the culture that operate on a daily basis.

## [[Zuboff, Shoshana, 2019, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism; The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, London, Profile Books|Shoshana Zuboff]]'s - Surveillance Capitalism
She discusses new developments in Capitalism under 'smart' networked devices
She argues that surveillance capitalism claims private human experience whereas 19th century capitalism claimed nature.
Digital dispossession: theft takes place with the help of digital technologies
Private human experience is turned into a commodity, enabling hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales.
This information is sold for advertising, traded in a new market place for behavioural predictions.

Historically, she believes Google was the main driving force for this form of Capitalism.

#### Why the term Surveillance Capitalism?
It's taken without our knowledge.

For instance, breathing machines for people with sleep apnea were sent to health insurers, affecting insurance quotes
Google Nest incorporated senses and microphones
Google mail analyses emails for content
Facebook admitted to performing tests where certain things were admitted from posts to see how this would affect likes and dislikes
Google Streetview admitted to collecting and storing private data from people unbeknown to the people involved.

Default settings enable surveillance; the extraction of information.

### Key Notions
Economies of scale and economies of scope (lots of people, data, features)
Targeted advertising
Herding your behaviour in a particular direction: 'instrumentarian power'
Automating people
Asymmetry regarding knowledge: surveillance capitalism knows everything about us and we don't know how it works
Dependence on the system where we are locked in, with 98 percent of information in the world digitised by 2013.
Portrayed as inevitable - surveillance seen as inevitable components of the technology
Monopolisation through network effects: GAFAM and BAT dominate the market.

For example, Cambridge Analytica used a survey on Facebook to extract information about people's views, and thereof of their friends, enabling that company to target voters since they had very precise information about the profile for each individuals, knowing what issues are important to these individuals involved.

### What to do?
Unsuccessful campaigns - for example, hashtag delete Facebook and slacktivism.
New decentralised platforms - Diaspora (decentralised social networks). Many of these haven't came out of the ground.

Data literacy enhancement.
