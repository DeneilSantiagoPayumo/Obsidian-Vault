## Lecture notes:

The first part of this lecture revisited power. The notes are transcribed below:

What do we mean by the terms social relation and social structure?
We have a person. We know *nothing* about this person - we don't know their gender, race, income, so on and so forth. They are just a person and we've assigned no socially significant content yet. 

There is another person and we know nothing about them. Without knowing the content of their relationship we don't know about how power is exercised.

Let's assign some social roles: what about the social role between the worker and the boss? We know that they're hierarchically related. In this relationship the worker (ignoring the fact they may be in unions) will have no relationships.

What if the boss had power over three workers? Well, the same example applies - the boss can still exercise the same power. We know however that bosses typically exercise power over workers in many situations. A social structure is just a repeated pattern of social relations.

In this social structure we can refer to people who are in similar positions. We call this then structural equivalence. There may also be investors and capitalists, and they have a social relation to this structure. That is repeated and there are capitalists everywhere. These capitalists are owed power to the state. This is an example of structural power.

The working class however can go on labour strikes and capitalists can use instrumental power in capital strike against the strike. Social relations must be maintained before society, as it is, breaks down.

```ad-quote
title: Georg Simmel (1909)
"The large systems and the super-individual organizations that customarily come to mind when we think of society, are **nothing but immediate interactions** that occur among men constantly, every minute, but that have become **crystalized as permanent fields, as autonomous phenomena.** As they crystalize, **they attain their own existence and their own laws and may even confront or oppose spontaneous interaction itself.**"
```

Once these social relations become so general over time, it produces a structure that constrains our ability to invent social relations over time. It's difficult for us to completely innovate or walk away from these.

In Crowley's own terms: socials structures are relatively stable patterns of social relations that endure over time. They are both caused by and a cause of repeated social interactions.

Position in social structure **conditions but does not determine** action - it can be constraining or enabling but it cannot determine our actions. We cannot look at somebody's position and infer exactly what they are going to do.

## Topic one: The Welfare State as misnommer

```ad-quote
title: Textbook definition of the welfare state
"A welfare state is a state that is committed to providing **basic economic security** for its citizens by **protecting them from market risks associated with old age, unemployment, accidents, and sickness.**"
```

This is a tiny fraction about the welfare state: mainly they provide "social insurance, social rights, social provision, and the social regulation of economic action - the chief beneficiaries of which are not the poor but the middle class."

All states that exist today with some exception has welfare states - the concept only really refers to "a specific mode of governing and a specific sector of governmental activity ... one dimension of a much larger state that pursues other ends..." (Garland, 2016)

## What are the institutions that make up a welfare state?

Well, we've got:
1. Social insurance from market forces, in case you cannot acquire the means to survive. This is often **contribution-based**.
2. Social assistance - a safety net of non-contributory, income-support programs ... you have to prove that you have low enough income to benefit from this. This is means-tested.
3. Publicly-funded goods and services - education, healthcare
4. Social work - personalized forms of support such as social work for those with families, care for the mentally ill, supervision for offenders.
5. The "hidden welfare state" - through tax rebates, tax breaks, benefits that are provided through economic contracts mandated by the government. Your employer *has* to provide a health-insurance plan for example in the US.

Let's consider the components of UK spending (2019-20).
Things such as health, social security and long-term care and such take up a huge share of spending. Even if we think of the 'minimal' welfare state of the U.S, even they spend 14% on Health, 22% on social security and more.

The story here is overall growth in the 20th century and higher social spending.

## The Welfare State: Precursor

The New Poor Law of 1834.

Essentially, the royal commission argues that the able-bodied poor took the fund even though it wasn't meant that. The New Poor Law claimed that outdoor relief was not to be given - the poor, the sick, the aged were meant to live in the workhouse. This was to remove the incentive for relief out of idleness.

The new Poor Law was highly controversial: mixing savings from the poor rates rather than trying to fix their own corruption? Also, this was pretty mean to the poor.

The precursor to the welfare state was not nice or fun for anybody - the old Poor Law organized the poor into three categories:
- The impotent poor, the able bodied poor and the idle poor
- In principle, the forms of treatment accorded each group should correspond to their supposed deservingness.
- The deserving poor were able for outdoor relief - they can get assistance in their homes Whereas, the able bodied poor was forced to go into the workhouse and were paid a lot less.

By the 19th century, the displacement of peasants to towns and cities, and the unravelling of traditional support systems meant that we needed more relief. The New Poor Law of 11834 attempted to expand and formalize the 'indoor relief.' Above all, it expanded the amount of indoor relief (workhouses) in which people were subjected against their will to extremely difficult labour.

This persisted in the UK until 1948.

In the early 20th century, a new Liberal government that came into government by 1906 decided to undertake a set of reforms: the Old Age Pensions Act (1908) and National Insurance Act (1910).

### Catalysing Events: The Great Depression

After the Great Depression, politicians were shocked about the devastation of the second world war and the rising tide of socialism that they thought they'd ought to do something about this. Essentially, the state recognised the need to do these things and increased the influence of trade unions and the influence of working class people. 

### The Beverdige Report

This report was written in 1942 that named "five great evils" that the state must confront after the war: Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness.

Proposed expansion - national insurance and establishment of national health service.

These would be universal systems that are available to all citizens regardless of need and contribution

### Neoliberalism

By the late 1960s, the post-war economic boom has begun to exhaust itself. The 1973 oil price shock set in motion a wave of inflation and stagnation that saw real wages fall.

Voter dissatisfaction lead to a new form of political conservatism - "The New Right" that called for a return to laissez-faire economic policy.

Neoliberalism espoused a smaller role for the state in the economy. Think of Hayek.

## Welfare State Retrenchment

Newly ascended conservatives saw the welfare state as the cause of this economic problem of inflation and low-growth.

The story of the welfare state is more of durability and persistence - the success of direct attacks on social programs have been limited. Well, welfare states are typically popular and welfare states create their own constituencies that vote out politicians attached to public social provision.

Therefore, Thatcher and Reagan couldn't have gone after those at the biggest part of the welfare state. Neoliberal programs went after programs that had less popularity - those that benefitted the poor and socially marginalized.

A lot about neoliberalism was in regard to the ethic of personal responsibility: Margaret Thatcher believed that there was no such thing as society: there are individual men and women and there are families and we must simply look after himself.

She said this in a female's magazine,. Thatcher encouraged aspiration and individualism and enterprise, but envisaged no rule for the state in helping women - this really just shifted the burden onto women. Cuts in social welfare translated to more demands on women's time as unpaid carers.

*At this part, the lecturer began taking this Q and A section. Then the lecturer decided to play a video or some extra improvised slides about the cost of living crisis. You all left at the right time.*

Social welfare spending, after 2008, has stagnated. We can even see a massive fall in social housing as years come on - a trend going back to the 80s. This decline in social housing provision.

What kinds of people are most affected by housing disparities?

One person says - people with lower income, less stable employment circumstances, 

Another person says - young people especially, as they start off on lower incomes. Waitlists for social housing lists grow, there is more competition, so on and so forth. This has an upward effects for the market as people who are on the waiting list for council homes must go to private houses... but that's too expensive.

Another person says - geographical locations, like London. We can also consider the right-to-buy schemes: Thatcher's scheme that if you were living in a council property you could buy it. This sucked and really just reduced housing.

I left.
