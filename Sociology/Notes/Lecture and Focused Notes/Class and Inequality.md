## Lecture information:

```ad-tldr
This lecture will look at class in the 21st century. We will consider the material, symbolic, cultural, and moral dimensions of class. After providing a theoretical grounding for understanding class, we will then consider case studies ranging from education through to the economy, media, and stigmatisation.
```

Can we define social class only on **economic** principles?
What allows for social classes to take on **meaning** in the social world?
Can any social group be described in objectified terms?

## Lecture notes:

Some people have argued 'class is dead' as it does not provide an understanding of how people understand their identity, circumstances and more. You've got people such as Jan Pakolski and Malcolm Waters arguing that class is dead.

Foster market based forces (Thatcher) in which people look after themselves. Movements abandoned the notion of class and instead discussed factors and life-styles.

These ideas have never been strong in the US. There's a general feeling of class-based identities becoming weaker. Other inequalities such as gender or race have become central to political struggles and class is falling over by the wayside.

Political parties have abandoned class-based platforms in favour of those oriented toward values and lifestyles (Grusky et al 2014).

This changed from structuralist explanations for inequality and instead individualist. Richard North wrote [[Rich is Beautiful]]:

```ad-quote
"Where once one could fairly blame the "system" for someone's inability to get ahead, now one may more fairly blame the person himeslf. Only the very stupid have a good excuse for staying working class.... it is surely to say that the rungs are there, and those who find them too arduous may just not be very good climbers ... that is, why it is reasonable that the class system is dead."

```

Not only does this individualistic rhetoric, there's this derogatory element to it: there must be something wrong with people who can't climb. They don't have the effort, or the skill.

One of the insidious ways of spawning this problem is that you can't use it as an explanation of inequality, not as a vehicle for discussion. It flips it into an individualistic statement.


## The double existence of class - [[Pierre Bourdieu]]

There's this double existence of class, not just written in the objectivity of the first term (income levels, other forms of wealth).

```ad-quote
title: 2013, p.296
"Social groups, and especially social classes, exist twice, so to speak, and they do so prior to the intervention of the scientific gaze itself: they **exist in the objectivity of the first order, that which is recorded by the distribution of material properties**: and they exisit in the objectivity of the second order, that of the contrasted classifications and representations produced by agents on the basis of practical knowledge of these distributions such as they are **expressed in lifestyles**. These two modes of existence are not independent."


```

You've got these differences in income, and alters the form of life. There's a relative aspect to class. People in positions of power who have a legitimate form of domination and hierarchy.

Social classes have both an objective and intersubjective analysis.

This marked a revival of class analysis. For Savage (2000), Bourdieu argues:
	"...lead not to an emphasis on class as heroic collective agency, but **towards class as an implicit, as encoded in people's sense of self-worth and in their attitude to and awareness of others** - on how they carry themselves as individuals." (p. 107)

What this analysis represents according to Bottero (2004) is:
	"[A] radical shift in how class is seen to operate. Rather tha the **polar terms of "class in itself" giving rise to "class for itself" in which inequality triggered consciousness and action**, this new model **sets out a reverse process**, where explicit **identification and awareness dissolve**, leaving behind a hierarchical version of "class", implicitly **encoded in identity through practice.**"


## Boundaries

Social Boundaries: "Social boundaries are **objectified forms of social differences** manifested in unequal access to and unequal distribution of resources (material and non-material) and social opportunities." (Lamont and Molnar, 2002: 168)

Who is to say one form of cultural practice is more or less worthy?

Symbolic boundaries, principles of classification:

```ad-quote
title: Lamont and Molnar, 2002: 168
"Symbolic boundaries are conceptual distinctions made by social actors to categorize people, practices, and even time and space. They are tools by which groups struggle over and come to agree upon definitions fo realtiy that allows us to capture the dynamic dimensions of social relations, compete in the production, diffusion and institutionalization of alternative systems and principles of classifciatons. **Symbolic boundaries also separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership** [...] they are an essential medium through which people acquire status and monopolize resources."


```

Classes are economic locations with rules for cultural memberships. They shift and change.

These forms of capital may include economic, cultural and social capital. There are also sub-categories.

When Bourdieu talks about cultural capital, it comes in three forms:
1. Embodied - Accent, styles of dress, the way you carry yourself.
2. Objectified - the things we like, dislike, what cars we have or dislike.
3. Institutionalized - TBA

Social capital: how we can utilize our networks for more opportunities, the opportunities we have.

These approaches have led to sub-fields of research, some on objectified cultural capital, how culture is embodied in economic and social relations, there were tons of work such as Mike Savage in 2015 to study these classes.

We draw relational pools to others who draw to us ideas and classify us in an idea about already existing hierarchies in society. We are able to judge a person's position according to their own social expressions and we cannot stand back from these processes,

There's been attempts at making these forms of classification and researchers have tried to model each form of category.


## Reproducing class inequality: Education

Position making in society is defined by talents and hard work. Meritocracy increasingly is becoming a myth:
1. Just 5 per cent of children eligible for free school meals gain 5 A grades at GCSE (State of the nation 2016)
2. 12,200 a year is the average spending on a privately educated primary pupil compared with 4,800 on a state pupil (Reay)
3. Half of free school meal children are educated in just a fifth of all schools, an analysis of DofE data reveals that schools with the highest number of pupils of FSM face the deepest funding cuts.

Nearly half of Cambridge graduates end up in the elite, compared to an 1/8 of Anglia Ruskin.

Friedman and Laurison (2019):
Oxbridge graduates from top public schools are twice as likely to enter the elite than Oxbridge graduates from any other school. A handful of educational institutions, at both secondary school and higher education levels, are funnelling a very small segment of the population into elite occupations.

Impacts pay awarded too:
Graduates from the University of Cambridge, on average, earn £20,000 more annually than graduates from their neighbouring university, Anglia Ruskins (GBCS).

These elite schools are already aligned with the space of cultures and social networks. 


## Social Capital / Networks

Does who you matter more than what you know?

- Great British Class Survey (2013):
	"People who are financially well-off know fewer people in working class jobs than do people who are less well-off. Poorer people know far fewer people in high-status jobs than do their better-off neighbours."

So:
- 80% of high earners know a CEO, compared to 20% for the lowest
- Those earning 100,000 are twice as likely to know an Aristocrat / Noble than those earning £50-100,000
- **Those with parents who are managers / professionals know on average at least three people in different elite occupations** (Aristocrat / Noble; scientist/researcher; finance manager; CEO; university/college lecturer; software designer; bank manager; solicitor) rather than **working-class who average 1.5**


## Rule of reproduction: capital flows to capital

**Income**:
- The UK is only below the US when it comes to income inequality

**Housing:**
- The gap between the housing haves and have-nots is accentuating the divide

**Wealth:**
- The richest 1000 families own more wealth than 10.2 million families.

Housing can subsume employment. The highest levels of economic capital are self-generating in an increasingly intense way. There are forms of culture capital legitimised by society: embodied by institutionalization, different repositions, taken as what is legitimate capital and what is taken as the opposite.

What does it mean when this unfolds? The percentage of individuals who have received or expect to receive an inheritance: most groups expect to receive an inheritance. Whereas in the poorest groups, 57% of the groups expect to receive an inheritance compared to the richest groups of 90%.

```ad-example

![[Pasted image 20240201115808.png]]

```

People in London not only have more wealth, but have to give more to people to earn a place there. We're increasingly relying on our parents to provide us with that. British people find that despite country's widening wealth inequalities, the nation is a meritocracy (Mijs, 2019).

Yet, there are two modes of reproduction that are accelerating (Wacquant):
1. School-mediated reproduction
2. Direct reproduction

There are these two modes of production - school-mediated reproduction, culture and norms provided by institutions we have to pass through, and power passed through by our families and economic wealth.

This does not imply that those who earn more do not work hard. They have worked hard and they've excelled in the institutions. That said, there are inequalities embedded in that process so that individuals are barred from it, benefitting other individuals.

As more and more individuals access this wealth, it plays to individuals:
```ad-quote
title: Moor L and Friedman S (2021) Justifying inherited wealth: Between 'the bank of mum and dad'
"I felt really guilty when I got given the money ... I was just really aware that other people couldn't afford to do this and everyone else was working as hard as I was." (Amanda)

"I could have spent all that money on iPads and phones and everything else. I didn't because I know that my dad din't do that. He was training at uni for, like, nine years ... he was like, we had a black and white telly in the eighties ... there was no fancy stuff." (Les)
```

There is an implication that imaginary others, with Les, it is contingent on financial impulse that can redirect criticism of fancy wealth. This inflicts the gaze on those who do not have the same ethos.


Let us focus on groups of individuals who are not benefitting from these classifications. What does it mean for individuals who are just outside of those circles?

## Stigma in 'neoliberal' times

Tyler (20515: 505-6) "What distinguishes neoliberal media culture is that **class inequalities are rescripted to appear a consequence of individual choice**, wealth is "earned" and poverty is "deserved".

Certain behaviours are located with negative labels. This aligns certain groups with those labels, and values and judgement with those societies are used to justify political policy. This also affects their individual behaviours.

Lamont (2019: 676) "The growing stigmatizing of poverty brings about a **hardening of boundaries** toward groups **stereotyped as lacking in self-sufficiency**"

Lamont finds this study of people who are lacking the qualities in life and are stigmatized for that.

Wacquant (2009: 49) The "war on poverty has given way to a similar war against the poor, made into the scrape-goats of all the major ills of the country and **now summoned to care for themselves lest they be hit by a volley of punitive and himilating measures** intended, if not to put them back onto the narrow path of precarious employment, then at least to minimize their social demands and thus their fiscal burdens."

Wacquant found themselves a scrape goat of poor people, and are rejected politically and economically.

### Angela Davis

"**Between 1981 and 1985, military budgets have totalled 1.2 trillion and the Pentagon has proposed 2 trillion more for the next five years.** 3 million spent every day for the past two thousand years would equal 2 trillion - the amount the Pentagon proposes to spend in the next five years. In 1986, the Pentagon spent nearly 1 billion a day, which amounts to 41 million an hour, or 700,000 a minute." (1984: 136)

In this same time frame, welfare recipients receive 111 a month and subsidized housing cut by 63%. Twenty million are hungry, one million taken off food stamp programmes. Black children are likely to be born into devastating conditions.

```ad-quote
title: 119
**"Afro-American children are twice as likely as white children to have no parent employed** to be unemployed as teenagers, and to live in substandard housing. They are three times as likely as whites to have their mothers die in childbirth. moreover, **those between the ages of 15 and 19 are four times as likely as white children to be incarcerated in jails and prison**.

```

Also, there's "Poverty Porn" and stigmatization, creating and highlighting a culture around people who are on poverty. There is believed to be a culture of people who don't work, will never work, are on handouts and benefits.

Ian Duncan Smith writes that some young adults have "destructive lifestyles" and "no interest in work" because "they have seen their parents, their neighbours and their entire community sit on benefits for life." (Cited from Macdonald et al 2014)

Boris Johnson says that working class people are likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless.

in a piece in The Times, James Delingpole writes about Chavs:
	"The reason Vicky Pollard caught the public imagination is that she **embodies with such fearful accuracy several of the great scourges of contemporary Britain**: aggressive all-female gangs of embittered, hormonal, drunken teenagers; gym slip mums who choose to get pregnant as a career option..."

There's this modern iteration, "chavettes":
	"Funny because it's popular in both England where it's a familiar scene and in other countries where they're shocked to know that it's actually realistic."
	"Chav" is someone "who can be messy" and doesn't "take care of their appearance. The personality is what defines someone as a "chav" - someone who's rude, loud, fights all the time and bullies people."

Welfare recipients in America, Chavs in England and now Chavettes. We're seeing particular groups of people because they're being carried with a lack of culture capital. Many of these videos talk about "most chaviest places in the country", and these theoretical notions merge in the example.

It has real world consequences: "I would feel very resentful if those people got this for free. My husband and I work very hard to afford this. I would move out. Why should they get this for free?"

[[Shildrick]]:
```ad-quote
title: British Social Attitudes, 2016
"Poverty propoganda works to stigmatise and label those experiencing poverty and related disadvantages and thus effectively hides the real causes and consequences of poverty."

"Poverty propoganda has both real and ideological effects. Punitive and divisive policies towards poverty become more palatable - and even desired - by a general public who on the whole tend to accept that such responses are acceptable and in many cases necessary."

```

This has led to **austerity politics**, where Chancellor George Osbourne instigated a series of cuts amounting to £83 billion in 2010. This has led to austerity suicides. An extraction of those resources. Be that in welfare retraction, people who get out too easily. The policies of neoliberalism are justified through these processes of stigmatisation and class is expunged on understanding this entirely. It's all about the individuals.

The same is true even to this day.

```ad-example
title: It's happening today:
![[Pasted image 20240201123133.png]]
```

Tyler, in a book *Stigma and Machine of Poverty* (?) suggests: "Stigma production from above accelerates in periods of political and economic turmoil, as a means of initiating new rounds of capitalist accumulation and as a means of containing class struggles." (Tyler, 2020).

These practices foster these practices of identification: why would a working class woman identify as working class, why would they seek to justify it as a label?

A landmark study in 1997 finds that: "These women are **highly sensitive to issues of class and difference but they have no discourse available for them to articulate it as a positive identity**. Their class struggle is waged on a daily basis to **overcome the denigration and de-legitimising** associated with their class positioning."

People in these marginalised communities distance themselves from others:

```ad-quote
title: Shildrick and Macdonald, 2013
"Detail the 'disindentification' strategies of an 'economically marginalized and impoverished faction of the working class' on a Middleborough estate, **whom tried to 'distance themselves from the underclass, workshy and benefit claimants label so dominant in contemproary political discourse." (Shildrick and Macdonald, 2013).**"
```

This has a racial element:

```ad-quote
title: Lamont, 2019, 675
"**White American working-class men drew strong moral boundaries toward the poor**, contrasting their own 'disciplined self' with the alleged laziness and lack fo self reliance of the poor, and **of poor African Americans in particular.**"

```

In reality, Macdonald et al (2014) finds that if we look at benefits street, only 35-38% were on out of work benefits. This pattern happened in extended communities. Many were unemployed. Many were employed. This subjective reality is important for the cause of worklessness.

## Precarity

The TUC report finds that 1 in 13 BAME employees and 1 in 8 Black employees are in insecure work.
5 percent (one in 20) of working age Black people are employed on zero-hour contracts.
Just under 8 percent of black people are employed in temporary work.

Now, there are now **eight million people in poverty who live in a household where at least one person is in work**, with for the first time **the majority of people in poverty are actually in employment**. 

The **nature of poverty in Britain** is changing: "the idea of 'making work pay' increasingly sounds like an empty slogan to the millions of people who are hard-pressed and working hard, often in two or three jobs and struggling to make a living (Sentamu, 2014 p. 4)

It is also **expensive to be poor.**
	Estimate that the average cost of the poverty premium if £490 per household per year (Davies et al: 2016).

It's hard to be poor, and many people are working. Even looking at class in economic conditions, it's hard to define class.


In COVID-19, there became critical conditions: who can work from home, who can self-isolate, who can stock pile resources? There's evidence to suggest that death rates were four times higher for adults of working age in the poorest areas than in the wealthiest places.

The fact is that people in poorer areas find themselves in overcrowded areas, and there's evidence ultimately that people in these areas was at its highest recorded. And finally, there's studies that household size correlates to increasing the odds of a positive test.

On the opposite side, there are opportunities to see this process of de-stigmatisation: those classed as key workers were the same workers who faced years of stigmatisation.

The availability of alternative narratives can buffer people from the stressors associated with inequality and foster collective well-being. (Lamont, 2019). We had huge increases in fiscal spending, the amount given to people through furlough schemes. The benefits people received were huge. We had a reversal of the process of de-stigmatization, with the classificatory framework used to justify those policies were reversed.

Three aspects:
1. We drew conclusions from institutional forms, reshaping or reforming the ways we think about the world
2. To provide positive construction of behaviours with those who perpetuate that stigmatization. Through our own descriptions, writings, watching, professions we find ourselves in, having those dialogues allowed people to challenge those narratives.
3. Laws and policies needed to protect others in those positions.

## So what is social class?

Tyler (2015: 493): "The problem is that the concept of "class" describes is inequality."

Tyler (2015:507): "The interval between class understood as an identity, and as a descriptor for struggles against the inequalities which these identities name and pescribe, is precisely the axis from which class analysis should proceed. The most effective forms of class analysis are concerned not with **undertaking classification per se** but rather with **exposing and critiquing the consequences of classificatory systems** and the forms of value, judgement and norms they establish in human societies.**"

For instance, our study of stigma.

Class is an inherently global phenomenon - cotton in 18th century factories, textile industries in the Global South, workers in Primark / McDonalds, CEOs of TNCs. These theoretical frameworks are applicable to the US.

```ad-quote
title: Lamont, 2019
"At a time when neoliberal scripts of self are diffusing worldwide, it will be important to consider the significance of such scripts for global inequality."
