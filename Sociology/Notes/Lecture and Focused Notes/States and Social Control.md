## A recap on the welfare state:

Hidden homelessness - concealed households, more than one household occupy a dwelling occupying one household.

Is the welfare state a racial state?
[[David Goldberg]] argues that all modern states are racial states - "race marks and orders the modern nation-state, and s state projects, more or less from its point of conceptual and institutional emergence." All states are racialized as race marks and orders all modern racial states and their projects, to their constitutional arrangements.

The Welfare State apparatuses, policies and 'technologies of the state' helped fashion and modify means of subjugation and the terms of racial expression - how racial groups are bordered and the hierarchy that makes them. Racial states become engaged in the constitution and management of 'whiteness', a form of European domination. Even states that are 'colourblind' are racial states - it follows that white states produce manage and sustain the conditions of relative power, privilege, and property of the whites.

In a society that is hierarchically ordered according to racial groups where whites have lots of capital, states reflect this power structure - [[Mackinnon]] argues that the state is male, Goldberg argues that the state is white. So long as the society is structured around sexism and the hierarchy, Goldberg makes a similar argument for race.

To it, the racial state is racial because of the structural position they occupy in producing or effecting racially shaped spaces ... inclusions and exclusions and more. The experiences people have in the world are structured by state, and so as long as states produce this racial hierarchy and structure, states will be racial.

Is the welfare state a racial state?

The New Deal Coalition - the new deal is considered the founding of the US welfare state, during the 30s the Great Depression, the US state is confronted with mass unemployment and poverty. As a result of the depression, the government made an ambitious policy agenda that set out to accomplish: a stimulation of the economy (think Keynes!), eradicate poverty, wage control, social insurance programs and more.

Let's talk about the southern democrat: who were white, mostly exported cash and tobacco, liked low tariffs and enforced society through Jim Crow laws - racial segregation. "Preserving the autonomy of local state structures from national interference ... built on the twin pillars of planter dominance and racial disenfranchisement."

To bring them on board, the Roosevelt government were forced to make concessions that would protect these labour practices of the South. They preserved institutional structures: 

Robert Lieberman (1998) Shifting the Color Line: Race and the American Welfare State, p. 24:
 *“Southern society combined labor-repressive agriculture with racial disenfranchisement and segregation to subdue African-Americans both economically and politically. 
 Southern politics placed a tremendous premium on preserving the autonomy of local state structures from national interference, and these local political structures—built on the twin pillars of planter dominance and racial disenfranchisement—were constructed particularly to serve the elite white employers of African-American labor.”*

*The 1935 Social Security Act excluded farmworkers and domestic workers (among other occupations) from eligibility for the public pension system. These jobs accounted for 90% of Black workers in the South. As a result, 65% of Black workers were ineligible for Social Security.* 

The ability to exclude African-American from benefits has been a central factor in the adoption of national [welfare state] policies.

The Home Owners' Loan Corporation had racial practices of redlining: [[Blacks and the Racialized State]]. You know about this.

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) helped to improve home ownership to Americans but at the same it had a huge impact on racially shaping private markets and entrenching black subordinations regardless of their work ethic. If you can't get a loan to buy a house, it becomes difficult to get a home loan. It leads to an intergenerational transmission of disadvantages.

## In the case of the United Kingdom and austerity

Austerity did not make a racial state a racial state. It just transformed the ways racial-ness is described. At least from 2010, it is totally race-blind: you can't look at the budgets that the racial state passed and find anything inherently discriminatory for this social program. In fact, the austerity state is cutting back on programs that are on the reserve for these people. You can almost imagine the austerity state as equalizing: one could think that austerity cuts us universally half.

[[Austerity and Extending the Racial State]] - is council housing is for people of marginalized communities, and the austerity state wishes to remove social housing as a stock of housing and push people onto the private market it will have.
