Lecture: Nations and nationalism
Date: 12-10-23
Lecturer: Patrick Beart

## A history of nationalism:

It is a political movement that has ties strongly to the se a the nation, and advocates for self-determination.

It has connections to liberalisation movements inspired by Enlightenment thinking: the American Revolution in the second part of the 18th Century, for example, and it took on violent forms in Europe (WW1, Nazi-Germany).

It became central to the anti-colonial movements of the 20th century, and resurfaced in Eastern Europe after the breakup of the former Soviet Union.

It resurged in the 21st Century across the world and is often tied to religion. Look at white nationalism and Trump.

## Theories of nationalism - primordialism and perennialism

Primordialists and prerennialists explain nation in terms of a natural disposition towards it - a long history of extended kinship.

They draw on evolutionary logic: people will seek to pursue and protect this ethnic commonality, arguing that these roots make for a strong bond and criticising political movements not based on common ancestry.

There are subtle differences (but we won't describe them today).

Once we have those historical roots, we can construct a strong historical bond and a fixed collective identity that there means something intrinsic to being French or English or so on.

It neglects several factors though: for instance, a lack of historical accuracy of ethnic commonalities, overstating uniformity (essentialism) and more.

[[Anthony Smith]] revived this theory later.

## [[Ernest Gellner]]

He argued that nationalism needs to be seen in the context of the shift towards modernity and industrialisation - not permanent or natural features of the human condition.

He drew a Functionalist argument, and argued that modern states are characterised by industrialisation, requiring mass communication. It requires a standard educational system which leads to a standardisation of culture - a breeding ground of nationalism.

Nations are creations thereof by nationalism, and invented in several ways: languages are revived, traditions are reinvented.

Intellectuals often become guardians for imposing these cultures onto populations: eradicating dialects, local cultures with a uniform culture.

How does he explain the emotional basis of Nationalism if this is all Functional?

## [[Benedict Anderson]] in [[Imagined Communities]]

He avoided a Functionalist logic of explanation, and focused on how people developed a sense of national consciousness.

Nations are an 'imagined political community', imagined as people do not personally know most of the people of that community.

He paid attention to the role of 'print capitalism' in the spread of nationalism, arguing that this enabled the new and standardized languages to replace local dialects and cultures.

This made possible the spread of newspapers which made for the emergence of a national identity and national concerns.

## [[Hosbwn and Ranger|Eric Hobswn & Terence Ranger]]

They continued the interest in the construction of collective and national symbols and identity.

Their book - the invention of tradition - developed a historical examples and empirical case-studies to demonstrate the recent construction of collective identity and a shared culture.

"Inverted tradition" refers to a set of cultural practices that are portrayed and experienced as belonging to a distant past, but are usually recent creations.

He distinguishes between the two types of invention of tradition:
1. Adjusting old traditions to new situations
2. Deliberate invention of new traditions

This notion of national identity therein are recent.

## [[Anthony Smith]]

He developed a theory of 'ethnosymbolism':
This suggested that nation-states and nationalism built on 'ethnies' - pre-existing ethnic groups.

They are:

```ad-quote
title: On Ethnies
"Named human populations with shared ancestry myths, histories and cultures, having an association with a specific territory, and a sense of solidarity."

```

This leads to two models:
1. The Civic model where dominant ethnies lay claim to nationhood over long periods of times, subsuming other ethnies (France, India)
2. The Ethnic model, where some ethnies cut across nations and share ideas of future nationhood (Kurgs)

From his theory, the lack of ethnic unity would be problematic for the survival of the nation-state:
```ad-example
title: Cases where a breakdown of Ethnic unities would be problematic:
The breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s
The dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992
The ongoing call for independence within the UK, Spain and Belgium

```

## [[Michael Bilig]] in [[The national in everyday life, a critical engagement with Michael Billig's thesis of Banal Nationalism]]

He studied social psychology and taught it at Loughborough.
Study of nationalism focuses on extreme forms of nationalism.

He wants to have a subtle versions of nationalism or representation of the nation that we constantly are exposed to:
* Subtle, subliminal in which the nation is represented: for example, the uses of 'we' or 'our nation', and music or sport, or even the adoration of the queen.

This form of nationalism is powerful as it tends to be ubiquitous, unconscious and the existing social research focuses on extreme forms of nationalism, not noticing these subtle forms.

## [[Partha Chatterjee]] in [[Nationalist Thought And The Colonial World]]

He disagrees with this: pointing out the distinctive nature of nationhood and nationalism in Asia and Africa.

This is often in opposition to Western notions of nationhood and nationalism, arguing that Anderson erroneously assumes that the political imagination in non-Western parts of the world resemble Western ones and are derived from them. 

He points out that in the case of India, that intellectual and political elites reassert their identity in relation to the sacred realm: spirituality distinguishes them from their Western counterparts.

## Gender and Nationalism

There is a striking absence of gender in theories of nationalism, even though nationalist imagery is gendered (Father Russia, Mother India)

Female bodies are used as markers of national and ethnic boundaries: ethnic violence within nations involve sexual violence (Partition of India 1947, Rwandan Genocide 1994).

[[Nia Yuval-Davis and Floya Anthias]]'s article identified five ways in which women tended to participate in ethnic, national, and state processes and practices:

1. As biological producers of members of ethnic collectivities
2. As reproducers of the normative boundaries of ethnic groups by enacting 'proper' feminine behaviours
3. As participating in the ideological reproduction of the collectivity and as transmitters of its culture
4. As signifiers of ethnic and national differences
5. As participants in national, economic, political and military struggles.

## Globalisation debate: Radical globalists or hyperglobalisers versus anti-globalist

Radical globalists believe that we have become dependent on corporations, capital, consumers and communication.
We live in a borderless world.
Nation-states are subject to pincer movements: caught between the pressure of a supra-national organisations and social movements.

Anti-globalists agree with the hyperglobalisers about the trends, but dislike it.
They deplore the erosion of nation-state and welfare protection, and denounce the erosion of the public sphere.
They conceive of globalisation as Americanisation, with supra-national organisations as complicit.
They also see globalisation as the spread of neo-liberalism.

Against that view, you've got the global sceptics and argue that globalisation is nothing new.

Between 1870 and 1914, sociologists [[Paul Hirst and Grahame Thompson]] argue that: trade and investment flows were higher previously, migration patterns were also higher but national borders were less porous.

The contemporary economy is not as global as it seems, and that most global transnational corporations are multinational corporations with a national basis.

There's also the global transformationalists of [[David Held and Anthony McGrew]] that says that globalisation is not radically new but a readjustment of old order.

Americanisation is not yet: the impetus from US only counts for 20 percent.
There are many inequalities in many worlds but fewer people are destitute.

There is a stretching of global networks (with global warming), and intensity of global interconnectedness with high-speed telecommunications and velocity of global flows.

So the role of the nation-state is still thus, but reshaped.

## Nationalism and populism:

Brubaker wrote an interesting article about Populism and Nationalism - Populism is distinct, opposition between elite and the people whereas strong nationalist elements in populist discourse and policies - economic protectionism, reneging international commitments, strong focus on the protection of borders, nostalgia and so on...

Possible explanation for its appeal: from the 1990s until the 2010s, centre-left political parties embraced neo-liberal economic policies and identity politics culturally.
