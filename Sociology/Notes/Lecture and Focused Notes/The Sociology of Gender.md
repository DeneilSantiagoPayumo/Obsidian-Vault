## Lecture information:

```ad-tldr
a. In this part of the lecture we will discuss the sociology of gender, including its history and relationship to feminist sociology. We will consider what is ‘sociological’ about gender, and how is gender understood as a social structure?
b. In part two of the lecture we will consider how the sociology of gender has changed over time in relation to critiques of the category ‘woman’ from both Black feminist thought and queer theory

Notes given by Finley!

## Lecture Notes
Gender: recapitulation of sociology itself
Discipline is fluid and continues to change

Perceptions and experiences of gender:
- Intimate and personal, yet also structural and abstract
- Ubiquitous and omnipresent but can be invisible
- Operates on conscious and unconscious levels
- Can be understood as a binary or a spectrum, fluid or fixed, changeable of predetermined
- Gender categories often used for objects e.g. boats; used as a kind of code; links to culture war issues
- Does it signify sex? Yes and no

## Sex and Gender

Must be considered both literally and symbolically
Oakley - ‘(The debate) ...seems to be revived at times when the existing roles and statuses of male and female are changing’
‘...we are now able to disregard (if we wish) almost all the so-called consequences of the reproductive division between the sexes’
Difference lies within how the two are treated as values; perception of the terms
People tend to disregard evidence on the subject before jumping to conclusions
Gender a verb masquerading as a noun?
Gender as representation?

A ‘proxy’ for:
- Naturalness, causality, origins, truth
- Common sense
- Moral purpose and social integrity
- Tradition and identity
- Continuity, inheritance, survival

Perception is an embodied, causal, material product of existence and perceptions have determining effects

Whilst we can critically analyse, we cannot be fully conscious of the particularities of our own perceptions

## Origins of current gender models:
- Transformation of ‘economy’ to exclude the household and reproductive labour coincides with the rise of industrial capitalism and the relegation of the entire domestic sphere to the margins of public life’
Shift from status to contract; emergence of modernity - [[Maine]]
‘Precisely because he has no familial status, he becomes the protypic modern citizen’

‘...dawn of a new era precisely defined by the decreasing power and influence of kinship and family ties’

Women remained substantially defined - and technically owned - by the contractual terms of marriage
Contractual ownership a paragon of the slave trade
The idea of a “political economy” is born into a social context divided between those who own and those who are property

Biological variations; Darwinism
Origin of Species borrows ideas of familial ties to understand evolution
Nature as profitable; token of industrialisation

How is gender analysed?

[[Firestone]] - ‘That so profound a change cannot be easily fit into traditional categories of thought, e.g. “political”, is not because these categories do not apply but because they are not big enough’

[[Engels]] - ‘...we observe the movements, transitions, connections rather than the things that move, combine, and are connected’ - dialectical materialism; theories of change

[[Connell]] - *Hegemonic Masculinity*
- Normative ideal of man contrasted with subordinate men
- Hegemonic means accepted and not scrutinised
- Class and the entire social order are implicitly involved in the making of hegemonic gender relations
- Dangers of reifying the concept

[[Judith Butler]] - reverses arguments that gender is the social construction of biological sex; points out that sex is socially constructed according to gender
They are inherently changeable, but are sedimented through stylised repetition
