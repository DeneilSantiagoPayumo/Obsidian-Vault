What is his theory?
[[Benedict Anderson]]

Rise - print capitalism
Imagined political community - limited.
Demotion of the sacred language, lower master status and labels? Hegemony?
Decline of religion?
Aristocracy has fallen (not important)

We look at representation - visual representation of sacred communities.
Sociological imagination.

Nationalism, linked to the decline of three cultural conceptions - script language that lead Christendom, privileged access, the belief that society was organised around high centres (monarchs who were people apart from human beings), temporality (cosmology and history are indistinguishable, origins of the world and of men identical)

Strengths of it - re-envisions nationalism as a process, as a social movement, can potentially go to change how we perceive nationalism, breaks the myth, 

Great starting point for a revisioning of nationalism - why else do we make things on broad topics! To deconstruct it, of course.
Takes what we take for granted - Newspapers, and tries to uncover it.

Weaknesses - ironically too positive, doesn't work today (ethnic politics, mediascape? Too simplistic, global culture), Framing Devices, Religious fundamentalism does still exist.

How will the essay be structured?

Introduction - explain main strength, good starting point or branch to redefining conversation and study into nationalism, and how it is viewed: good for removing stigmatisation, leads into postmodern ideas. Important, interesting for changing the topic. However, struggles with multiple ideas - NAME DROP AUTHORS - too positive, mediascape (is Nationalism as still prevalent?) Importance of religion, framing device

... maybe just don't cover this.

[[The national in everyday life, a critical engagement with Michael Billig's thesis of Banal Nationalism]] - paddle boards off nationalism, Banal Nationalism

Needs to summarise it then discuss its arguments against it

Why? Is too basic for assuming such a broad theory.

[[The Politics of Belonging, Intersectional Contestations]] - Religion (duh!)
