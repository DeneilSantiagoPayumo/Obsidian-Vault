Despite its flaws and attempts to dismantle it, the welfare state persists throughout capitalist democracies. Why? What explains its staying power?

---

A deconstruction of the question: the welfare state is a complex definition with very little ways of defining it. Another deconstruction, the welfare state persists through capitalist democracies - there are multiple capitalist democracies.

Can we focus on Britain? Liberal US model.

[[The Welfare State, A Very Short Introduction]]
This article opens up and characterizes what the welfare state is:
It opens about the definitions of the welfare state.
It mentions that welfare states are varied.

Insight: for the purposes of the argument, we will consider the welfare state in Britain.

Taken for what it is, the welfare state simply must be given to - social insurance programs.

We can perhaps take the alternative argument, why *specifically* benefits of the working class struggle? No, weird argument.


Why does the welfare state struggle? This article poses a  look at 'moderate insecurity' and 'instability' - they sustain capitalist markets and private property.

[[Introduction, a neoliberal age]]

What are the flaws of neoliberal thinking? Why hasn't it destroyed the welfare state?

There are many approaches to neoliberalism - a form of capitalism, a political ideology, a governmentality.

Perhaps we can take a look at the flaws of neoliberal thinking - stubborn persistence of social democracy.

[[I don't know how she does it! Feminism, family and work in 'neoliberal' Britain]]

The power of the the welfare state resonating with female individuals? Could take a look at Tony Blair's New Labour government, and how this seemed to be in respect to social relations but was still within the firm grasp of neoliberal thinking - British social policy.

[[Blacks and the Racialized State]]

Blacks were impacted through welfare programs being selective.

[[Austerity and Extending the Racial State]]

Austerity Capitalism strikes at the heart of the welfare state, making a racialized state.

My conclusion:
The welfare state still remains standing as:
- The welfare state is a fundamental nature of Capitalism, and its incredible arrange of features and functions means it plays an important political role.
- The question addresses the impact of neoliberal thinking, arguing that they have attempted to attack liberal thinking: but this is inaccurate since neoliberalism could only go so far, depending on how we view the conception of neoliberalism. Despite attempts to dismantle it, Neoliberalism is a 'messy amalgam of older right-wing tenets with newer neoliberal ideas' Look at the NHS - government does not spend enough money on the NHS.
- Can we apply welfare state practices to COVID-19: the power of the welfare state is visible here, necessary to boost public spending is still incredibly important in Capitalism. The welfare state is still vital in ensuring the longevity of female people.
- The welfare state is contradictory: though its flaws in (Austerity Capitalism) and (Black and the racialized state), those who have been impacted the worst by welfare still depend on the welfare state to live.
- This essay is hampered at the fact it cannot generalize all welfare states: take a look at Britain's interesting colonial history. What if Sweden hasn't had 'attempts to dismantle it?'

Can we link this to anything?
Hayek, and his views on liberty and political responsibility.
How far can this apply to the nature of the welfare state as 'constraining' political action?

Why does this question matter?
The possibility of welfare, and how important welfare is, still matters today.
