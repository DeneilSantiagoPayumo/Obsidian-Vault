Waste of space conclusion 
Start at the conclusion and look back: a clear identification of an argument that I started with and returned to. Let us not be left with more questions than answers. Try and use the critique to my advantage.

Questions tend to force people into polarizing positions when in fact this is inaccurate: good scholars don't want polarized arguments.

Whilst we're trying to lay out our argument, then keep a side note about good ideas that are coming up - in the process of imagination - and something like that. When I'm reading something, pause and write something that says... this is incorrect?

That way when we get to the conclusion we can interject new fresh ideas, or at least something interesting. People would rather read a full bigger picture ending than what that has led up to.

Sovereign imaginaries (?) - a cool book that could prove useful... to be read when you have free time
Stuart Hall on ... 

What happened with these theories and why don't they address conflict - they address imagined communities as a concept but we should also aim to argue for its conceptual values and limits. The optics that Anderson had at the time - let's look at the situation at the time. The key thing for an excellent critique is... what if I'm coming out with necropolitics (what is that) and Stuart Hall:

This was in 2014, published by the Guardian. **Stuart Hall's cultural legacy: Britain under the microscope.**

He comes from Trinidad, went to Oxford, teaches at the open universities. We need to see the micro-level workings: whose imagined communities are we willing to talk about here? He's a very clear writing (unlike Pierre Bourdieu). Also, Sarah Ahmed's cool. Read someone incisive in terms of the limits. He was a public intellectual and was really cool.

Dictatorship, conflict, pain!

Petintok (yeah, this is probably not the right spelling of her name)

?????????????????????????

You theorize using a category that only applies to your nation, and it doesn't have that transferability. Maybe this is true... only if we use its optics. Can we capture an imagined community if we consider the chaotic plurality that we live in in the world order? Who is this imagined community? How does it get enforced? Imperial masculinity, race and science as affirmative device.

We must be COLONIAL.

A homogenous state must include some people in, and exclude other people.

Is this category or concept still viable: where, how, so, why.

Convince us that this problem still exists today, or how this problem can be applied today. 

Conclusion - horizon of the possible, the questions that still remain. The beauty of the ideas.

They hope we get to a point where we can begin to analyse things, not just describe them. We need the description as its the content knowledge but we also need a recognition of more powerful blind spots, how to think about that going forward and more.

Refine definitions (be more elaborate you know?)
We signpost, say what we're arguing and... hopefully the argument becomes the body of the story. I want to argue. My argument is. People can see that we're trying to move past the description.
