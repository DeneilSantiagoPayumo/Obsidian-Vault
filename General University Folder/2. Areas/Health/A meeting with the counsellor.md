Well, there's got to be *some* way out of this right?

You've got a meeting on Friday 13th October at 9:15 on Microsoft teams.

You should also do your homework:
1. Of the concerns you are facing, which one needs the most attention
2. Who if anyone outside of a counselling relationship may be able to help you with this concern
3. Do you experience times when this concern seem to be less of a concern?
4. How would you know that your session has been helpful (what changes)?
