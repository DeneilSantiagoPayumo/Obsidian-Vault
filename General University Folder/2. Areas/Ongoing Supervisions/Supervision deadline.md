They'll be constant, so you should be very, very vigilant.

Here are the timings for each thing:

Your politics supervision will take place October 23-24

Here are some suggested essay questions:

```ad-important
title: A list of supervision questions:

Why according to Hobbes should subjects obey the sovereign?

What for Weber are the political implications of the ethical irrationality of the world?

Why for Constant are the possibilities of modern politics circumscribed?
```

POL1 questions:

I believe you should choose thus:
Why according to Hobbes should subjects obey the sovereign?

This means you should ideally write this essay **by the end of this week**

Update this: perhaps he rescheduled it?
Should he not reply, you will need to finish reading Hobbes and finish the question by the end of this week.


Your sociology supervision will take place on:

```


Your social anthropology supervision will take place on:

```


Your international relations supervision will take place on the 24th of October:

```ad-important
title: A list of IR questions:
~~What explains the rise of the state and does this have anything to do with Westphalia (Lectures 2 and 3)~~

Does the state have a different history in Europe and the non-European world? Pick two regions from East Asia, Africa, the Americas to compare with Europe (Lectures 2-4, 6-7)

Without violence, there would be no nations. Discuss (Lectures 1,7)

Is the sovereign state a European export to the rest of the world? (Exam Question)
```

Given that Emily Isaacs has chosen the first question, you think it would be prudent to wait until the *violence* question.

Without violence, there would be no nations. You will have four days to write this.

Or, you can consider the sovereign question: is the sovereign state a European export to the rest of the world?

Should you choose the sovereign question, you will need to start writing it on the 16th which is next week.
