## In town supermarkets
### 1. Sainsbury’s
* Sidney Street (‘Mainsburys‘). 
- Opening times: **7:30am - 11pm** everyday and **11am - 5pm on Sundays**.
- The largest and most convenient true supermarket in central Cambridge but also the most crowded. 

### 2. Sainsbury’s Local
* St. Andrews Street (‘Slocal’). 
- Opening times: **7am - 11 pm** everyday. 
- The closest supermarket to Pembroke and the 11pm closing time definitely comes in handy for a late night shop. However, the selection is much smaller and the prices higher.

### 3. Marks and Spencer’s Food Hall
* Market Square. 
- Opening times: 8am - 8pm everyday and 11am - 5pm on Sundays.  
- Don’t let the reputation put you off - some M&S basics are **cheaper** than Mainsbury’s. The only other large supermarket right in central Cambridge.

### 4. Tesco Express
* Outside Lion’s Yard, opposite Market Square. Closest supermarket to college. 
- Opening hours : **7am - 8pm** everyday.
- An alternative to Slocal, closest to College.

## Out of town supermarkets (i.e. >5 mins cycle):

### 1. Aldi
* Histon Road
- Opening times: **8am-10pm** everyday and **10.30am-5pm** on Sundays
- **Best** **prices** in Cambridge, particularly useful if you have a supo on the hill .

### 2. Tesco Express & Co-op
* Hills Road
- Opening times: **7am-8pm** daily (Tesco), **7am-10pm** daily (co-op)
- A great pit stop on the way to the train station, only a 15 minute walk from Pembroke.

### 3. Tesco Superstore
* Newmarket Road
- Opening times: **7.30am-10pm** everyday, 11am-5pm on Sundays
- If you get into rowing this huge Tesco is super close to the boathouse and has the **cheapest alcohol**. It also has a very large selection of products.

### 4. Co-op
* Alisa Court
- Opening times: **7am-10pm** daily
- Distant from college, but handy for the boathouse (via the Fort St George footbridge). Moderate size. (Top tip - **you can get a TOTUM card for free as a student which gives you 10% off everything**.) 

### 5. Co-op
* Grantchester Street  
- Opening times: **7am-10pm** daily
- A very small store, but useful if you find yourself spending a lot of time in **Sidgwick**, also on the way to/from Grantchester Meadows.

### 6. Sainsbury’s Eddington (‘far-awainsburys’)
- Opening times: **7.30am-10pm** daily
- Quite far out, as the nickname suggests... if you find yourself at Girton a lot might be an option.
