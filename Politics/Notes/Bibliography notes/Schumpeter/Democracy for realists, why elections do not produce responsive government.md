## Democratic Ideals and Realities

A great number of people simply just don't pay attention to Politics. They're swayed by the times - economy, political loyalties from childhood and more. Election outcomes are determined by powerful forces but those forces are not how current democracies believe elections come out.

### Two fundamental models of Democracy and why it is inadequate

The first model is referred to the *populist* ideal of democracy, emphasizing the role of ordinary citizens in determining the policies of democratic communities. But how shall the people govern? First, it is through the election of representatives whom the public decide issues through, and in the other is through 'direct democracy', choosing policies themselves via initiative and referendum policies.

The second contemporary model is less popular, focusing on elections as mechanisms for leadership mechanisms.

[[Schumpeter]] (1942, 269) famously defined the democratic method as "that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's votes."

Scholars have fleshed out his account. The most influential is the *retrospective theory of voting* that portrays the electorate in its role as an appraiser of past events, past performance and past actions.

Here, election outcomes hinge on public approval and disapproval of the performance of political leaders. This model appeals as it puts less pressure on the voters to have elaborate policy views.

In reality, voters do not make choices on the basis of policy preferences or ideology, but shape how they think, what they think and where they belong in the party system - it is a mistake to suppose that elections result in popular control of public policy.

Politics simply isn't important as human beings are busy with their lives: school, jobs, meals to prepare, homes to clean, bills to pay, unemployment, illness, addiction and more. 

Even in reality, well-informed citizens aren't that analytical of politics - their thinking seems to be a mechanized reflection of what their group has instructed them to think.

In the face of modern social-scientific research, conventional thinking about democracy has collapsed. This book will elaborate.

## Article Introduction

>[!summary]
>In chapter 2 we take up the subject of popular sovereignty, the idea that 'if ordinary citizens were to reason ideologically ... then the prospects for democratic control would be enhanced.' In reality, the vast majority of Americans are innocent of ideology.
>
>In chapter 2 we survey a substantial body of scholarly work demonstrating that most democratic citizens are uninterested in politics, poorly informed, and unwilling or unable to convey coherent policy preferences through "issue voting". How, then, are elections supposed to ensure ideological responsiveness to the popular will? In our view, they do not. The populist ideal of electoral democracy, for all its elegance and attractiveness, is largely irrelevant in practice, leaving elected officials mostly free to pursue their own notions of the public good or to respond to party and interest group pressures. 

As we noted, Schumpeter believes that democracy "realizes the common good by making the people itself decide issues through the election of individuals who are to assemble in order to carry out its will." (1942, 250)

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Why the populist model sucks:

The most sophisticated instantiation of the populist ideal is the "spatial model" of voting and elections.

Here, the political space consists of a single ideological dimension where policies are arrayed from left to right, with voters represented by an *ideal point* along this dimension. Each party is represented by a *platform* reflecting the policy that will be enacted and voters are assumed to maximize their satisfaction by voting for parties closer to them.

Where there are two parties, there is a prediction: both parties will adopt identical platforms corresponding to the median of the distribution of voters' ideal points. This *median voter theorem* creates a general result regarding collective choice. Since a platform located at the median of ideal points has a smaller average distance from all voters' ideal points, the median voter theorem implies that electoral competition will ensure voters' preference are satisfied.

However there are multiple critiques: citizens have distinct, virtually uncorrelated, views about economic, social and foreign policies. In reality, the positions preferred by a majority of voters do not exist in a multi-dimensional world, so there is no policy platform with a logical claim to represent "the will of the majority."

The problem for majority decision making is a manifestation of the 'paradox of voting', and [[Kenneth Arrow]]'s *general possibility theorem* that shows that any collective decision-making process satisfying certain reasonable conditions must be subject to difficulties - a relatable, democratic procedure to aggregate preferences is impossible.

In reality, some people have argued for *deliberation* rather than formal agenda-setting procedures. Miller (1992) suggested that democratic deliberation may mitigate incoherence by generating widespread consensus about how to locate the various alternatives along a single dimension or how to separate an issue into independent components.

Really, this depends on the quality of deliberation or how frequently such reorganization occurs. If we take a debate where parties argue for what is at stake for national defence, there are issues - on what *basis* might they come to that agreement, and how?

```ad-quote
title: deliberation
"Just as with formal agenda-setting procedures, any particular agreement to divide an inherently multidimensional issue into unidimensional pieces will shape the outcome of collective choice in some way that is, from a purely populist standpoint, fundamentally arbitrary. Thus, deliberation provides no easy escape from the theoretical challenge posed by Arrow's theorem." (29)

### Public Opinion and Political Ideology

Arguably, according to [[Downs]] (1957, 258) because the infinitesimal role which each citizen's vote plays in deciding an election, the returns to acquiring political information are so low that rational voters will refrain from purchasing any political information per say. This is a big issue because rationally ignorant voters need political information - they need to know their own preferences and platforms of the competing parties regarding issues involved in elections.

One indication that the folk theory is shakier than expected is that expressed political attitudes can be remarkably sensitive to seemingly innocuous variations in question wording or context.

In reality, citizens do not have definite preference to be elicited and aggregated through some process of collective choice.

[[Philip Converse]] (1964) essay on "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics" provided an even more devastating portrait of the political thinking of ordinary citizens. (32-33)

1. He scrutinized respondents' answers to open-ended questions about political parties and candidates for evidence that they understood and employed the ideological concepts at the core of elite political discourse. He found that about 3% of the voters were clearly classifiable as "ideologues," with another 12% qualifying as "near ideologues"; the vast majority of voters (and an even larger proportion of nonvoters) seemed to think about parties and candidates in terms of group interests or the "nature of the times"
2. He assessed the degree of organization of political belief systems. Could respondents give consistently liberal or conservative response? "He found only modest correlations (averaging just .23) among domestic policy views..." ... "Converse (1964, 228) interpreted these results as providing strong support for the hypothesis that "constraint among political idea-elements begins to lose its range very rapidly once we move from the most sophisticated few toward the 'grass roots.'"
3. Converse gauged "the stability of belief elements" by tracking the same people's responses to the same questions across three separate interviews conducted at two-year intervals between 1956 and 1960. Successive responses to the same question turned out to be remarkably inconsistent.

Converse himself recognised that "constraint among political idea-elements" - especially across issue domains - was primarily a matter of social learning rather than logical reasoning. Thus, the political belief systems of ordinary citizens bore little resemblance to the ideal embodied in the folk theory of democracy.

This is not simply a remnant of an older and less sophisticated political era - recent studies have turned up similar findings.

### Political Ignorance, Heuristics and "the miracle of aggregation"

```ad-quote
"Changes in the structure of the mass media have allowed people with an uncommon taste for public affairs to find an unprecedented quantity and variety of political news; but they have also allowed people with more typical tastes to abandon traditional newspapers and television news for round-the-clock sports, pet tricks, or pornography, producing an increase in the variance of political informationa levels but no change in the average level of political information (Baum and Kernell 1999; Prior 2007)"


```

While formal education remains a strong predictor of individuals' knowledge about politics, substantial increases in American educational attainment have produced little apparent increase in overall levels of political knowledge.

In the early 1990s, a spate of books argued that voters could use "information shortcuts" or "heuristics" to make rational electoral decisions even though they lacked detailed knowledge about candidate and policies, taking a variety of forms - cues from trusted groups, inferences from stereotypes and generalizations from personal experience.

Political heuristics have defined the tasks of citizens sufficiently clearly for concrete performance benchmarks to be meaningful, they have tended to present those tasks in such a highly simplified form that all of the difficulties of real political inference are abstracted away.

```ad-example
![[Pasted image 20240115092257.png]]
```

The fact is that uninformed citizens cast different votes than those who are better informed. Seventy percent of voters, on average, chose the candidate who best matched their own expressed preferences. Is seventy percent enough? It requires a careful assessment of the extent to which "incorrect" votes skew election outcomes.

When thousands or millions of voters misconstrue the same relevant fact or are swayed by the same vivid campaign ad, no amount of aggregation will produce the requisite miracle; individual voters' "errors" will not cancel out.

### The illusion of issue voting

The spatial theory of voting cast "issue proximity" as both the primary determinant of voters' choices and the primary focus of candidates' campaign strategies.

[[Richard Brody and Benjamin Page]] outlined three interpretations of the positive correlation between "issue proximities" and vote choices:
1. Policy-orientated evaluation corresponds to the conventional interpretation of issue voting in the folk theory of democracy: prospective voters observe the candidates' policy positions, compare them to their own policy preferences, and choose a candidate accordingly
2. Persuasion involves prospective voters altering their own issue positions to bring them into conformity with the issue positions of the candidate or party they favour
3. Projection involves prospective voters convincing themselves that the candidate or party they favour has issue positions similar to their own

In the second and third cases, issue proximity is a consequence of the voter's preference for a specific candidate or party, not a cause of that preference.

```ad-example

```

Does issue voting compel both parties to adopt policy positions close to those of the median voter, as the spatial theory of election implies?

The broad analysis of U.S public policy in [[Robert Erikson, Michael MacKuen, James Stimson's]] *The Macro Polity* underlines the failure of issue voting to discipline politicians suggested by the spatial theory of elections. They measured the ideological tenor of policy activity to find that policy outcomes shifted when partisan control shifted from democrat to republican and vice versa - the public's policy mood influenced policy but by a small comparison.

Presidential election outcomes are strongly affected by the public's 'policy mood'.

Studies of Congress find that policy preferences of citizens in a given state or district are only modestly predicted of election outcomes and that Democrats and Republicans routinely take very different stands once they are elected, even when they represent states or districts with very similar political views. (46)

"The key point is that representatives' voting behaviour was not strongly constrained by their constituents' views. Elections do not force successful candidates to reflect the policy preferences of the median voter, as Downsian logic implies."
