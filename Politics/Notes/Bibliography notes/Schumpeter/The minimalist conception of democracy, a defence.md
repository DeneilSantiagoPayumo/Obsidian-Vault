## Article Introduction

>[!summary]
>I want to defend Schumpeter's conception of democracy. For him, democracy is just a system in which rulers are selected by competitive elections. Popper (1962: 124) defends it as the only system in which citizens can get rid of governments without bloodshed.
>
>Often, when people discus democracy, normatively desirable aspects of life are credited as intrinsic to democracy - often, systems of governments that are elected are not worthy of being called democracy until something is fulfilled.
>
>Let us put the consensual view of democracy in the bin. Societies are ridden with economic, cultural or moral conflicts. These conflicts can be "cross-cutting", accentuated by an overlapping consensus. Deliberation moderates but it can often solidify conflicting views.
>
>My defence of the minimalist conception proceeds in two steps: starting with the possibility that we want to avoid bloodshed, I argue that the chance of changing government can avoid violence. Secondly, I argue that being able to do it by voting has consequences has its own.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Why does the possibility of a changing government avoid violence?

The author starts with a thought experiment: assume that governments are decided through a coin toss that designates if they stay or leave. This designation is an instruction on what the winner and losers should and should not do.

Here, citizens have no sanction, prospective or retrospective and incumbents have no incentives to behave well in office.

```ad-quote

"Yet the very prospect that governments would alternate may induce the conflicting political forces to comply with the rules rather than engage in violence for the following reason. Although the losers would be better off in the short run rebelling rather than accepting the outcome of the current round, if they have a sufficient chance to win and a sufficiently large payoff in the future rounds, they are better off continuing to comply with the verdict of the coin toss rather than fighting for power."

```

The prospect of alternation may induce moderation while in office. Suppose that the current incumbent can either manipulate the probability of being re-elected or can decide what share of the pie to give. Yet there are conditions under which a democratic equilibrium exists in which the incumbents do not grab everything. If the cost of rebellion is sufficiently high for both, each incumbent will prefer to moderate its behaviour while in office rather than provoke a rebellion by the current loser.

Yet if the threat of mutiny were the only incentive to moderation, why would we ever adopt procedures that subject control over the exercise of rule to a lottery? Can't these political actors agree to a distribution that would have resulted from an open confrontation?

The answer lies in this view: it is impossible to write a dictatorial contract that would specify every contingent state of nature. Leaving the residual control over to the dictator would generate increasing returns to power and undermine the contract.

To avoid violence, the conflicting political forces adopt the following device: agree over those issues that can be specified and allow the residual control to alternate according to specified probabilities.

### Voting

Voting is the imposition of a will over a will - voting authorizes compulsion and generates winners and losers. It is voting that authorizes coercion, not reasons behind it. Deliberation may lead to a decision that is reasoned, may guide the implementation of the decision but voting ensures that they are coerced to obey with reason.

What difference is it that we vote? One answer is that the right to vote imposes an obligation to respect the results of voting - democracy is legitimate in the sense that people are ready to accept it.

The author instead suggests that voting induces compliance through a different mechanism - voting constitutes 'flexing muscles', a reading of chances in the eventual war. If all men are equally armed, the distribution of votes is a proxy for the outcome of war. Voting also reveals information about passions, values and interest - they inform everyone who would mutiny and against what. Democracy reveals a limit to rule.

```ad-quote
"The miracle of democracy is that conflicting political forces obey the results of voting." (15-16)
```

This is not consensus, and not mayhem either - just limited conflict.

Democracies don't last forever though: democracies are more likely to fall when one party controls a large share of seats in the legislature and democracies are stable when heads of government change not too infrequently, more often than once every fight years. Finally, the stability of democracies depend on their institutional arrangements: parliamentary democracies are more durable than pure presidential ones - one main reason being that presidents rarely change because they are defeated in elections.

1. Democracies are more likely to survive in wealthy countries
2. They are more likely to last when no single political force dominates
3. They are more likely to endure when voters can choose rulers through elections

Thus: "democracy lasts when it offers an opportunity to the conflicting forces to advance their interests within the institutional framework."
