### Ideas around Schumpeter's theory of democracy

"The democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote." (241)

We are provided with a different criterion. The theory embodied leaves all room for a proper recognition of the vital fact of leaderships. Third, there are genuine group-wise volitions (will of the unemployed) but our theory should not neglect them. Fourth, our theory is no more definite than is the concept of competition for leadership. Fifth, our theory clarifies the relation that subsists between democracy and individual freedom. Sixth, in making it the primary function of the electorate to produce a government, there is also a process of evicting it. Seventh, we must understand that decisions by simple majorities would distort the general will - the will of the majority is simply the will of the majority.

Democracy does not mean that the people rule - "Democracy means only that the people have the opportunity of accepting or refusing the men who are to rule them." (253)

Democracy has several conditions for it to function:
1. The first condition is that the human material of politics elected to serve in parliament are of high quality.
2. The second condition for the success of democracy is that the effective range of political decision should not be extended too far.
3. Democratic government in modern industrial society must be able to command, for all purposes the sphere of public activity is to include - no matter whether this be much or little - the services of a well-trained bureaucracy of good standing and tradition, endowed with a strong sense of duty and a no less strong *esprit de corps*. It is not enough that bureaucracy be competent to give advice, it must be strong enough to guide and instruct the politicians who head the ministries.
4. Democratic Self-control - everyone will of course agree that the democratic method cannot work smoothly unless all the groups that count in a nation are willing to accept any legislative measure as long as it is on the statute book and all executive orders issued by legally competent authorities. Electorates and parliaments must be on an intellectual and moral level high enough to be proof against the offerings of the crook and the crank. The politicians in parliament must resist the temptation to upset the government.

In both respects, capitalism is losing the advantages it used to have. Bourgeois democracy has been working with increasing friction - democratic method never works when nations are divided on fundamental questions of social structure.

"The essential point to grasp is this. No responsible person can view with equanimity the consequences of extending the democratic method, that is to say the sphere of "politics", to all economic affairs. Believing that democratic socialism means precisely this, such a person will naturally conclude that democratic socialism must fail." (266)

### Ideas around the folk theory of democracy

Democracy as a folk theory is invalid - it does not realise the common good. There is not a common good that can place answers in good or bad, or a common will. To different individuals and groups the common good is bound to mean different things.

Secondly, even if there was a common good there are not equally definite answers to individual issues - opinion on these differ constantly. There are problems in the valuation of present versus future satisfaction and everything.

Third, because of the first two propositions, the particular concept of the will of the people thus vanishes into thin air - there is no uniquely determined common good discernible to all.

If results that prove in the long run satisfactory to the people at large are made the test of government *for* the people, then government *by* the people, would often fail to meet it.

In the ordinary run of often repeated decisions, the individual is subject to the salutary and rationalizing influence of favourable and unfavourable experience, of simple and unproblematic motives and interests. It is with most of the decisions of daily life that lie within the little field which the individual citizen's mind encompasses with a full sense of its reality. Even when we move away from the private concerns of the family, the sense of reality is so lost - great political questions take place in the economy of the citizen with leisure hour interests that have not attained the rank of hobbies, and with subject of "irresponsible conversation" (234)

"Thus the typical citizen drops down to a lower level of mental performance as soon as he enters the political field. He argues and analyses in a way which he would readily recognise as infantile within the sphere of his real interests." (235)
Thus this: means that the typical citizen would yield to irrational prejudice and also the weaker the logical element in the public mind and rational criticism, the greater are the opportunities for groups with an axe to grind.

The main reason why this classic doctrine still exists is through the fact that democracy has taken on an almost mythical quality. Also, forms and phrases of classical democracy are enthusiastically approved by large majorities.

### Ideas around Democracy

Suppose a community reaches the decision to persecute religious dissent - the instance is not fanciful. It is na√Øve to believe that the democratic process ceases to work in an autocracy or that an autocrat never wishes to act according to the will of the people. This would've been the case in a democratic system. (216)

What about antisemitism? What about witch-hunting?

"The crucial question is: would we approve of the democratic constitution itself that produced such results in preference to a non-democratic one that would avoid them?" (217)

Therefore, "Democracy is a political method, that is to say, a certain type of institutional arrangement for arriving at political - legislature and administrative - decisions and hence incapable of being an end in itself, irrespective of what decisions it will produce under given historical conditions." (217)

Democracy in itself cannot be an end in itself, and unconditional allegiance to democracy is also completely pointless - propositions about the working of democracy are meaningless without reference to given times, places and situations and so, of course, are anti-democratic arguments.

There are a number of difficulties with introducing democracy or democratic elements - democracy discriminates, democracy is always wrought with power imbalances, democracy has a ton of differing beliefs and arguments.
