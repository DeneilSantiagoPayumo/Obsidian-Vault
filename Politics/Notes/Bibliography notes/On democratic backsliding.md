# ON DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING
## Article Introduction

How exactly will these break down? How exactly will democracy break down? What kind of concrete actions transform a regime from one type to another? Let us talk about democratic backsliding

At its most basic, it denotes the state-led debilitation or elimination of any of the political institutions that sustain an existing democracy. 

It illustrates the forms that have varied in frequency over time, and examines historical varieties of backsliding.

A close look at backsliding reveals that the classic open-ended coup d'etat of the Cold War are outnumbered by promissory coups, that dramatic executive coups of the past are being replaced by executive aggrandizement and that election-day vote fraud that characterised elections is being replaced by strategic harassment and manipulation.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Positive Trends

Three of the most dramatic varieties of backsliding seem to be waning: coup d'etat, executive coups by elected leaders, election-day vote fraud have declined in frequency. (paraphrased, 6)

The likelihood that a democratic government being the target of a successful cop has declined markedly.

The decline of executive coups - coups that "involve a free elected chief executive suspending the constitution outright in order to amass power in one swift seep." (7)

The decline of election-day vote fraud: electoral malpractice and open fraud have decreased over time. (7-8)


### Continuing Challenges

Promissory coups - "frame the ouster of an elected government as a defence of democratic legality and make a public promise to hold elections and restore democracy as soon as possible." (8) These are stressed with the temporary seizure of power that makes way for a new and improved democratic order.

An example of democracy deepening after a coup has remained rare.

Executive aggrandizement - contrasting all forms of coup-making in that it takes place without replacement and at a slower pace. "The more common form of backsliding occurs when elected executives weaken checks on executive power one by one, undertaking a series of institutional changes that hamper the power of opposition forces to challenge executive preferences." (10)

Typically done through legal channels, using existing courts and legislatures.

Manipulating elections strategically - "Strategic manipulations denotes a range of actions aimed at tilting the electoral playing field in favour of incumbents. These include hampering media access, using government funds for incumbent campaigns, keeping opposition candidates off the ballot, hampering voter registration, packing electoral commissions, changing electoral rules to favour incumbents and harassing opponents - but all done in such a way that the elections themselves don't appear fraudulent." (13).


### Confronting Backsliding

A change in pace - de-democratisation is likely to be incremental rather than sudden, declining slowly.

A first challenge is scholarly - we need to pay attention to incremental erosion.

This creates political challenges, alterations in electoral law, court-packing, civic organisations silenced, and a slow slide towards authoritarianism lack the bright spark that ignites a call to action.

A second challenge - rational response. Opponents of backsliding are likely to be more successful if they recognize that current trends are not random events but rational responses to local and international incentives. Today's trends are rational reactions to international incentives - the emphasis that democracy promoters put on elections, the rule of law and other institutions are deemed important ere. (paraphrased, 15)

Third-  vexing ambiguity. Challenging laws crafted by democratically elected executives is risky. Second, proving a change in institutions is nefarious is difficult. Third, not all targets are unambiguously democratic themselves, weakening the defender's credibility in the long run (para, 16)
