# Is This Really How it Ends?
## Article Introduction

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?
This is a review of Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt's [[How democracies die]] for why Trump's presidency might endanger America.

She summarises as: "democracies depend not just on institutions like courts committed to protecting the rule of law; they also require informal norms that all political players need to observe to keep the democratic game going." (2019)

This is also a review of David Runciman's *[[How democracy ends]]* By becoming fixated on Fascism, he argues, we will miss today's real challenges - the catastrophe of climate change, and how social-media networks are undermining democracies in subtle and fatal ways.

"Democracy, Runciman says, is about keeping the future open and enabling people to change their minds after encountering different views and new information; the Internet giants, by contrast, profit from always giving us more of the same. Combine the power of algorithms with a state committed to all-out surveillance of its citizens and you get contemporary China, an authoritarian model that Runciman regards as a serious rival to democracies today." (2019)

### Levitsky and Ziblatt's book: How Democracies Die

```ad-quote
"Today we face what the democracy-defense industry variously calls democratic "erosion," "decay" or "backsliding"."

The choice of these metaphors to describe democracy is not neutral; the terms suggest quasi-natural processes, when in fact democracy’s demise is the result of many conscious decisions. Levitsky and Ziblatt also use these metaphors, but they point the finger at particular people; for them, democracy’s breakdown is about elites abandoning the norms needed to hold politics together.
```

"Levitsky and Ziblatt rightly insist that Trump is not a lone demagogue who came out of nowhere; instead, they argue, he was produced by a culture of "extreme polarization" that created an environment in which the normative "guardrails" of democracy were first loosened and now might get broken off altogether. In particular, political actors no longer accept the legitimacy of other contenders for power, and they cease to exercise "forbearance" - a willingness to not always push institutional prerogatives to the limit."

This is a very asymmetrical phenomenon - only republicans have denied a hearing to a Supreme Court nominee with a view to capturing the Court. "Yet Levitsky and Ziblatt do not just blame right-wing elites; they also blame the people. Give citizens a chance to participate in primaries and let them speak their minds on social media, they warn, and democracy might go to hell."

People often view the US as one of the world's most enduring democracy. In reality, they argue that "earlier norm compliance depended on the country not being properly democratic to begin with. The emphasis on racial inequality here, however, also casts doubt on the country not being properly democratic to begin with."

In reality, they have no answer to begin with - it is a mistake to think that democracy will only work if there is niceness and consensus about observing norms. What matters is to understand conflicts. Additionally, there is also more room for "the people" to come in.

### David Runciman's *How Democracy Ends*

```ad-quote
"Runciman sees no danger of fascism returning: "our societies are too different - too affluent, too elderly, too networked - and out collective historical knowledge of what went wrong then is too entrenched." That might sound complacent, but Runciman is right that nowhere in the West do states propagate the same kind of systemic cult of violence and racism that was at the core of fascism in the 20th century."
```

For Runciman, during the Gilded Age at the end of the 19th century, there was "slack" in the political system. As a result now, that there isn't there and citizens see political institutions as unresponsive.

```ad-quote
"By contrast, for Levitsky and Ziblatt, there is still plenty of slack, and democracy remains to be fully realized in the United States. But for Runciman, democracy is tired and worn out. This exhaustion is not a terminal condition, he notes, but rather the misery of a midlife crisis. People are no longer energized by the prospect of change in which all might gain; if citizens act at all, they do so only to get something back that they feel they’ve lost—which means a great deal of energy goes into blaming those who were allegedly responsible for the losses."
```

Climate Change lacks the immediacy to inspire political action but not enough to change it.

Another challenge is Facebook - Facebook's power is connective, but hoards its authority and its real challenge is epistemological. "Democracy is a form of institutionalized uncertainty ... It means that democracies can learn and adapt. The internet ... actually closes our minds by tailoring that knowledge to reinforce our political biases."

Runciman believes that China is a threat to democracy, promising dignity for the individual (one person, one vote) and collective benefits. Nationalism and great-power status.
