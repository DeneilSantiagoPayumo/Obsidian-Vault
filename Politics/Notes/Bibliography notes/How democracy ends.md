## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Coup

So long as enough voters are wiling to see a victory for either side or the other as a win for them personally, democracy can keep functioning. The danger comes when the permanent losers outnumber the occasional winners - when conspiracy theory moves from being a minority pastime to a majority pursuit. (50)

Conspiracy theorists are no longer just for losers - winners believe in them too (see Donald Trump.) After Trump's victory, see the Democrat's conspiracy theories about the Russians.

This is characteristic of a period when populism has come to dominate democratic politics. The basic idea behind populism is that democracy has been stolen from the people by the elites. In order to claim it back, the elites have to be flushed out from their hiding places, where they conceal what they are up to by paying lip service to democracy. (51)

Once conspiracy theorising becomes a philosophy, it becomes self-reinforcing - voters do not take it in turn to voice their suspicion that the system is rigged. 
 
This may be even harder in the newer era as democracy is older, lacking slack or unfulfilled potential with the battles to expand the franchise has been expected to provide. "People are angry with institutions that are unresponsive, not because they are underdeveloped but because they are tired." (55) We are tempted to make it work better by focusing on what we have lost rather than what we have never even tried.

Democracy can be awakened by sense of collective identity, but now the destructive capacity of the leading states is too great to allow it.

Also, inequality is a big problem that drives inequality. "The most successful democracies are the ones that have managed to limit violence, ensure against disaster and protect the peaceful lives of their citizens. As a result, inequality has slipped free from the democratic grip it was once held." (60-61)


### Catastrophe

Runciman briefly outlines three types of catastrophes:
1. [[Rachel Carson]] - a picture of a society slowly killing itself, if life ends, then democracy does.
2. [[John Hersey]] - nuclear weapons causing a 'gateway to hell'
3. [[Hannah Arendt]] - Eichmann in Jerusalem, the banality of evil - there are Eichmann in every society, in which mindless administrative structures spread through the system, aided by faceless bureaucrats.

"Arendt argued that twentieth-century democracy had a form of mindless built into it. The creation of modern democracy required the construction of a large administrative apparatus that operates mechanically, according to its own rules and regulations. In this system, technical expertise gets prioritised over human values." (66) ... going through the motions causes destructive impulses.

This mindlessness is what links environmental catastrophe, nuclear wars and genocidal oblivion. It may take place in some distraction in which we do not realise that our homes are being destroyed, we may be too hyper-attentive: too focused on the game of nuclear deterrence or or we could be obedient to a course of actions that everyone else is doing. (paraphrased, 66-67)

Why has the warnings of environmental catastrophy no longer resonating as they once did? (68-69)
1. "Success: there is less to fear once our earlier fears have been dealt with. The greater risk now is complacency. Having seen off one threat, we are tempted to think that any fresh dangers are being exaggerated, forgetting what it was that rescued us first time around."
2. "The politics of environmental regulation are more divisive than they were half a century ago." - what is the value of public goods, how much should be distributed?
3. "The third reason for the change is that Carson's vision of the worst that can happen has long been superseded by another kind of threat. The space for worrying about environmental disaster is now fully occupied by the idea of climate change." 

For people in better off regions, climate change lack the novelty, lack the immediacy of Carson's account, there's an account of apocalyptic fatigue and more. Additionally, conspiracy theories underlie climate change - it gets described as a hoax. Look at the fossil fuel industry.

"The most passionate advocates in the arena of climate politics are the deniers, who see it as a liberal plot. There is a lot of frenetic democratic energy being devoted to challenging the reality of climate change. It is deeply unproductive. As Arendt implied, modern politics make it possible to be in a manic state and to be in a trace at the same time. When it comes to climate change, democracy increasingly look like the spell, not the cure."

What about the fear of nuclear weapons? Ironically, nuclear weapons have become more threatening - a commander-in-chief may use them, terrorists can acquire them. But it is an all or nothing phenomenon.

"Climate change lacks political grip on our imaginations because it is so incremental. The environmental apocalypse is only ever a creeping catastrophe. We experience it as a rumour. Nuclear catastrophe lacks grip because it is an all-or-nothing phenomenon. There is nothing that can make it real without threatening to make everything else effectively meaningless." (73-74)

What about evil? Trump supporters often see themselves as the last vanguard against totalitarian - they are fed fake news, and argue other people are peddling the argument that Trump is a special kind of Hitler. Active citizens need to take action to save democracy from itself.

"Democracy survives because very little can now kill it as a form of politics. The death of civilisation might have to come first."

If nuclear weapons are fatal to democracy, how did it survive? In the Cold War, democracy was built on bread-and-butter issues: jobs, welfare, education. The nuclear state gave the democratic state room to breathe. Democracy thrived under these conditions as existential questions could be brought down to the level of bread-and-butter politics.  What counted was how people felt about the politicians making decisions on their behalf, big and small. (80-82)

Game theory infected politics with ideas of perfect competition and efficient market. But now it has turned bread and butter politics into a nuclear-stand off: it treats the choices faced by individuals as though they can be modelled into existential terms. (63-64)

Another fear - inter-connection. Our world has become m ore vulnerable as everything is joined to everything else. "What makes networks frightening is the thought that they could collapse without any warning. There does not need to be human intent involved. A network might simply out." (85)

We may simply just sleepwalk to disaster. The fear of being interconnected and permanently alert politicians to the dangers of making irreversible mistakes. What happens if we shock a sleepwalker then? "Sleep walking and tightrope walking are both features of contemporary democracy. It is what gives our politics its peculiar double quality of attentiveness and carelessness." (87)


### Technological takeover!

Runciman cites several theorists:

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] - he saw our growing dependence on these artificial pleasures and comforts as a mark of civilisational failure.

"Gandhi places much of the blame for what's gone wrong on modern representative democracy. A political system that depended on elected officials to take decisions on our behalf would never be able to rescue us from this artificial existence." (90)

We have become thralls to the machine, and we receive cheap promises and outright lies.

He was somewhat right. Unintelligent machines are already doing a lot of work in contemporary democracies. We rely on them so much that we become trapped and dependent on its spell. (90-91)

[[Max Weber]] thought that Western democracy is not dominated by the political machine - "Weber could imagine no way for our societies to function without these vast, soulless structures. It made democratic politics a particularly alienating business. What gave us a voice was also what made us cogs in the machine. That, for Weber, was the modern condition." (94-95).

[[Jeremy Bentham]] on the other hand was mocked as a 'calculating machine' and wanted politics to work better, democratising it and making it formulaic.

[[Thomas Hobbes]] thought of a state as an 'automaton', brought through the principle of artificial motion that has no thoughts. The state had to be machine-like to save us from our natural instincts as if not, we will turn everything into shreds.

What frightened him the most were corporations that over time we have stopped noticing how strange and machine-like they are. He believed the way to control them was to empower the artificial state. Looking at the East India Company, we can see how the state has asserted itself against the corporation.

"Weber was right: modern democracy can't escape the machine. What Gandhi sought in that regard was utopian. But the democratic machine can help to humanise the artificial modern world." (97)

Runciman believes that whilst the state can attack corporations, at the same time their right to buy political influence has become unchecked. Corporations are dangerous as they control what we see, shape, hear and more. (98-99)

What corporations have is the connective power of technology that rules us through habit, persuasion and distraction. "A corporation like Facebook can never 'do' democracy better than a state ... what Eggers brings out is not the direct threat but the risk of collateral damage." (104)

Modern democracy is riddled with holes. Many people do feel neglected. Their views seem to count for very little and their representatives often appear uninterested in hearing them out. Contemporary populism feeds off this sense of disconnect. Even if social media can't provide a substitute for modern democracy, it can offer tempting ways to plug some of the gaps. (104)

But twitter is no way of doing Politics - online communities move quickly, lynching is real, physical harm, mental harm, we move on people that we are displeased by. It makes a mockery of democracy. "At best it offers a feeble imitation of democracy, in which the people get to vent their frustrations without having to face up to the consequences." (106)

Now:
Contemporary democracy has become incredibly artificial and many of its members seem to have scant interest in politics.
Party politics has grown more partisan.
Charisma at the top of mainstream politics have become increasingly rare.

The result is that established political parties have taken a battering at election time.

The dawn of the internet age has promised to grant us information to tackle democracy, but we lack the desire to change it. "But we lack the motivation because acquiring knowledge remains hard work. Avoiding hard work is part of the point of representative democracy." (113) We have become watched, but it's not that we don't know that we are being watched, it's that we simply don't care. 

Representative democracy was intended to work against our cognitive biases, putting barriers in the way of immediate gratification and slowing down decision-making. But now, democratic politics is self-defeating: we move on, we purchased over and over again. Bulimic capitalism.

Alternatives: pragmatic authoritarian, epistocracy and liberated technology.
