## **A note on the text**

There are multiple renditions of the Leviathan. These editions are differentiated by bibliographers on the ornaments that appear on the headings - for example, the 'Head', the 'Bear' and the '255 Ornaments.'

The only substantial difference between the several head editions occurs within Hobbes' theory: some passages that imply after the Resurrection the wicked might lead a normal sexual life were cut from the book.

The manuscript of the Leviathan is interesting however. The MS (manuscript) lacks the dedication to Francis Godolphin (as it is presented to the king) and there are some other minor differences. For example, (the ones of historical interest) has the MS refer to the independents in more hostile terms: perhaps Hobbes toned down the hostility displayed to the Presbyterians and Independents to fit the support for the independents?

It's hard to consider Hobbes motives: was the MS intended for Godolphin and then switched to gain favour with the king? Or is it a reflection of Hobbes' belief that Charles would not return from Britain, with the presentation of the MS be a part of Hobbes to gain favour with the king.

## TO MY MOST HONOR'D FRIEND MR FRANCIS GOLDOLPHIN of *Godolphin*

Hobbes here 'humbly dedicates' this discourse of Common-wealth to his friend. He knows that the world won't receive it too well but he believed it necessary to do so.

## THE INTRODUCTION

"NATURE ... is the art of man ... that it can make an Artificial Animal."

He argues that the Leviathan is an artificial man that can protect and defend against the 'natural' or a life without the state.

He breaks down the body of the Leviathan:
* The Sovereign is deemed as an artificial soul
* The Magistrates of Judiciary and Execution are artificial joys
* Reward and Punishment (that moves every member to perform their duty) are the nerves of the body.
* The Wealth and the Riches of the members are its Strength
* The Safety (Salus Populi) are its businesses and counsellors which in turn suggest upon it memory, equity, laws, (artificial) reason and will, concord, health, sedition, sickness, civil war and death of which people are made united.

To describe the nature of this artificial man, Hobbes wants to consider the *Matter* and the *Artificer*, *How* and what *Covenants* are made (the *Rights* and *Power* and *Authority* of the Sovereign), what is the *Christian Common-wealth* and the *Kingdom of Darkness*.

To Hobbes, wisdom is acquired by reading men and by doing so, we unveil his design. For a man to govern a whole nation, he must learn man-kind.

## CHAP I: *Of* SENSE

In describing the thoughts of men, Hobbes discusses their senses that from what other conceptions are derived.

The cause of Sense is the 'Object' which presents the organ to each Sense with taste and touch: seeing, hearing and smelling, continued inwards to the heart.
To the ear, there is sound, an odour in nostril, heat, cold, hardness and softness which we discern by feeling. When we move or use our bodies, it produces a light and object - the 'very object seem invested with the fancy it begets in us'. That said, these external objects are severed from us - 'so in that sense in all cases is nothing else but original fancy caused ... by the pressure that is, by the motion of external things ...'

## CHAP II: *Of* IMAGINATION

Hobbes here describes the movement of the body. Essentially, when a body moves it will move eternally 'unless something (else) hinders it.' In this sense, the body is an animal looking for it's own self preservation - 'heavy bodies fall ... out of an appetite to rest.'

The Romans called the imagination, well - *Imagination* but the Greeks call it *Fancy* which signifies its *appearance*. Imagination is nothing more than *decaying sense* and is found in every creature. 

This decay is the obscuring of it. Hobbes uses a metaphor here of the light of the sun obscuring the stars - with us, the imagination is obscured when objects (like Stimuli) make an effect on our body. The longer the time is, the weaker the imagination is. When imagination (and the sense thereof) is fading, we call it *Memory.*

Much of memory is called *Experience*, with imagination being one of the few things that can be seen by the Sense all at once or at several times. The former is *Simple Imagination* as one imagines something they had seen before, whereas the other is *compounded* as we conjure an image created from several figures.

"The imaginations of them that sleep are called *Dreams*. The organs of sense are unable to be moved by the external objects. Essentially when we dream we don't question reality. We believe ourselves awake. And as noted, different distempers create different dreams.

Hobbes believes this ignorance of distinguishing dreams arose the religions of the past. God can make these unnatural apparitions that scare people and the frequency of which can scare people. These are necessary for civil obedience.

The imagination that is made in man is what we would call *Understanding* and is common to a man and his animal. Conceptions and thoughts, the context of his beliefs.

*[A large portion of this text has been cut out for brevity]*

Hobbes believes God can create unnatural apparitions, but condemns religious leaders that suggest God can do anything, forcing those into civil obedience.
He believes that this should be the work of schools - they teach that 'imaginations rise of themselves' or that 'good thoughts are blown (inspired) into a man' where in fact they are created through stimuli.

## Of the Consequence or Trayne of Imaginations.

Here, Hobbes argues that the succession of one thought to another is called *Mental Discourse*.
When a man thinks, his next thought is not altogether so casual as it seems to be - our thoughts, imaginations, motions, fancies continue after sense.

There are two sorts of mental discourse: the first is *Unguided, without Designe*, where there is no passionate though to govern and direct the thoughts that follow - commonly the thoughts of men without a care, busy. The second is constant, *regulated* by some desire and design - the impression made by things so strong it breaks our sleep. Our thoughts of regulated Thoughts is incredibly, produce the 'like of that which we ayme at.'

The train of regulated thoughts is of two kinds:
One, when of an effect imagined, we seek the causes - we can imagine what we can do to it. The other is, when imagining any other thing, is to seek all the possible effects that can be produced. In summary, within the discourse of the mind, it is nothing but the seeking out of *Invention*.

*[A large section of this text has been cut out for brevity]*

Prudence is a presumption of the future, contracted from the experience of time past. Being a man means to live with five of his senses, watch a state enter ruin.

## CHAP IIII Of SPEECH

The invention of printing is no great matter - a profitable invention for continuing the memory of time past, dispersed into so many distant regions of the Earth. Speech is used for men to register their thoughts, recall them when they have passed and declare them to one another. The first author of Speech was *God* himself.

The general use of speech is to transfer our mental discourse into verbal or the train of our thoughts into words: for two commodities, the registering of the consequences of our thoughts and put us to a new labour. Therein, the first use of names is to use for notes of remembrance. Another is when people use the same words to signify one to another, what they desire and fear - for this Hobbes called them *Signs*. This is important to find the cause of anything, and to show others what knowledge we have occurred, and to make known to others our wills - and finally to delight ourselves.

But we can abuse speech:
1. When men register their thoughts wrong by the inconstancy of their words.
2. When they use words metaphorically and thereby deceive others.
3. When by words they declare that to be their will
4. When they use them to hurt each other

Speech is composed of names, validity is a category that does not appear outside of speech.

## CHAP V Of REASON, and SCIENCE

*[This section has been cut off for brevity]*

The observation of nature and the sensation is affected by the individual character of the observer, so thus we cannot turn to nature as a basis of truth. There must therefore be a governing body, and when there is a controversy in an account, the parties must by their own accord, set up for right Reason.

These definitions are agreed upon because they are determined by a judge whose decisions everyone has agreed to uphold - each step of the reasoning process must itself be secure in its claim. This geometric logic is indisputable no factions and no civil war. This approach to science, through geometric proof, is necessary for the preservation of peace.
## CHAP VI Of the Interior Beginnings of Voluntary Motions; commonly called the PASSIONS. And the Speeches by which they are expressed.

There are in animals two sorts of motions - one called *Vitall*, the course of blood, breathing, excretion and the other being Animal motion otherwise called *voluntary* motion, to speak, to move our limbs: caused by the action of the things we see.

This endeavour - the small beginnings of motion - is called *appetite* or desire. When the endeavour is reversed, it is called *Aversion*.

That means which men desire, they also love and hate those they are adverse. Things which we neither desire nor hate we are said to have *contempt* - immobility, resisting the action of certain things.

Because the constitution of a mans body is in continual mutation, men have different consent to desire, of their appetite and aversion. We call the objects of our desire *good* and the object of our hate *evil*, our contempt *vile and inconsiderable*. This is all subjective as we must *deliberate* to draw our conclusions, this is our *will*, the last appetite in our deliberating.

Continual success in obtaining those things, this constant prospering, is what men call *Felicity*.

## CHAP. VII. Of *the* Ends, *or* Resolutions *of* DISCOURSE

Of all discourse there is an end. If the discourse is mental, it consists of the things that will be, or not be - breaking off the chain of a man's discourse, you leave him in a presumption of what will be. This is an *opinion*, an alternate appetite. Opinions alternate, in the question of true or false, is called *doubt*.

No discourse can end in absolute knowledge. 

Conclusions derived from such a discourse is called *Opinion*, if science is *the knowledge of the consequence of words*. If the foundation of discourse is even narrower, the resolution of such is called *Belief*. Therefore, all knowledge is conditional.

By believing in this creed, we acknowledge the doctrine, holding his truth sacred whether he understand it or not. 
 

[The next few sections are cut for brevity]

## Chap. X. *Of* POWER, WORTH, DIGNITY, HONOUR, *and* WORTHINESSE.

The *power* of a man is to take his means to obtain a future good.
*Natural* power is the eminence of the faculties of body and mind.
*Instrumental* are those powers, instruments to acquire more - which many consider to be good luck.

The greatest of human powers, compounded of powers of men in one person - natural or civil, the power of the common wealth, powers of faction.

Men can be judged by their power - '*To value a man at a high rate is to Honour him; at a low rate, it is to dishonour him*'

[The next few sections are cut for brevity]

## Chap. XI. *Of the difference of MANNERS*

By *manners*, Hobbes describes 'those qualities of mankind that concern their living together in Peace, and Unity.'
In here, felicity is progress to ensuring your life content, a 'continual progress of the desire.'

For mankind, there is a 'restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth onely in Death' - he cannot ever be content with a  moderate power. Kings, whose power is greatest, amass power through laws and wars.

Competition of riches, honour, command inclines with to kill, subdue, supplant or repel the other. That said, a *desire of ease* and *delight* means that man may obey a common power, as their power and life is protected (not from the state of nature) and they can work together. That said,  a fear of wound, oppression, death and more lead to civil disobedience.

Vain-glory is a key part of this civil disobedience. These men suppose themselves 'gallant', estimating their sufficiency by 'flattery'. Another key part is ambition, without the taming of such, or 'publique employment in counsell or magistracy', the honour of their wisdom is lost, these men otherwise could impose their wisdom on the government.

Those that approve a private opinion, call it *opinion* yet should they dislike it, it is called *'heresy'*. Ignorance of the causes and constitution may make a man make custom and example the rule of his actions - and likewise' that Just, of the impunity and approbation whereof they can produce an Example' form a precedent. The doctrine of right and wrong is disputed by both pen and sword.

Having anxiety over the future, of ignorance and imagination, the 'feare of things invisible' leads people to create religion. Hobbes notes that those observing religion has been inclined to nourish and form those into laws, having power over people.

## CHAP. XII Of Religion

This chapter considers the role of religion.

Men have created religion.
1. First, from his desire of knowing the causes of thing
2. Secondly, upon the sight of anything that was born, to realise it also had a cause
3. Thirdly, as a means to assure himself 'of the true causes of things.''

This spawns anxiety, perpetual fear brought by ignorance, creating these ghosts and invisible agents that 'could never enter the mind of any man by nature', treating them to further ceremonies.

For these seeds of religion have received culture: one to have nourished and ordered them, the other that obey religion on God's commandment. The religion of the former sort is part of human politics, that makes those inclined to obedience and civil society.

Religion is founded on this faith in a single person, of signs and miracles. Thereon, Hobbes attributes the changes of religion in the world to these 'unpleasing Priests'.

## CHAP. XIII Of the NATURAL CONDITION of Mankind, as concerning their felicity, and Misery.

Nature has made man equal, that when all things considered, the difference between man, and man, is not so considerable. The weakest in this world has the strength to kill the strongest. 

As to the faculties of the mind, we are equal in intelligence for Prudence is but Experience. For such is the nature of men, that they consider themselves more equal in intelligence to other men.

For this equality of ability arises equality of hope in attaining our ends - if two men desire the same thing that they cannot enjoy, they become enemies and endeavour to destroy another. From this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any man to secure himself as Anticipation, till he see no other power great enough to endanger him.

In the nature of man, we see three areas of dispute:
1. Competition
2. Diffidence
3. Glory

The first make men for gain, the second for 'safety', the third for 'reputation.' The first use violence, the second to defend them, the third for trifles.

This is the state of war. In this condition there is no industry, for industry is uncertain, and no culture of the Earth or any commodities that may be imported by sea. For life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

Without the comfort of laws, security that restrict man, where concord 'dependent on natural lust', no common power to fear, men will dissolve into civil war.

## CHAP. XIV. *Of the first and second* NATURALL LAWES, *and of*, CONTRACTS.

The right of nature is the liberty each man has to use his own power for the preservation of his own nature - of his own life.

By LIBERTY, is understood as the absence of external impediments that take away part of a man's power.
A LAW OF NATURE is a precept found through reason by which man is forbidden to do that may destruct his life,

As the condition of man is a condition of war of everyone against everyone governed by their own reason that it follows in such a condition, every man has a right to every thing. When these conditions are met, there can be no security to man. Therefore, it is a precept *"That every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps, and advantages of Warre ."*

The second right of nature is: "*By all means we can, to defend ourselves.*"

As long as every man holds this right, so long are all men in the condition of war. But if other men will not lay down their right, then there is no reason to divest himself of this. To lay down a man's right is to divest himself of liberty, for if he renounces his right, there is  nothing to which every man had not right by nature, that he may enjoy his original right without hindrance.

By renouncing or transferring his right, he is said to given the right to another, the interference with this act an injustice.. So that injury is in depictions of absurdity. By renouncing his right, usually in consideration of some right transferred to himself or other good, for the voluntary act the object is some good to himself. That said, some rights can never be transferred to another - man cannot lay down the right of resisting them to take his life by force. The same can be said to wound, change, and imprisonment.

Through this we form a *CONTRACT*.

This contract, and the power that constrains those, force people to behave within the contract.

Contracts are made verbally or through inference. To be released from this contract, they must perform the terms of the contract to its end, or are forgiven by the one who made the contract. This contract has to be done through freedom and liberty, as any contract under torture is not since anyone will say anything to preserve this life.

It is not possible to make a contract with God. He is simply too supernatural and there is no way to know if the covenants will be accepted or not. The matter of such is always something that falls under deliberation.

Contracts cannot be passed down in lieu of death. And a contract that prevents you from laying down your life is always void. A contract for men to accuse themself is always void again.

## CHAP. XV. *Of other Lawes of Nature*.

From that law of nature follows a third: *That men perform their covenants made.*

In this law of nature, where no Covenant has proceeded and no right has been transferred and every man has right to everything, no action is unjust but should a covenant be made, to break it is unjust.

There must be power to compel people to not break the covenant.  In covenants of mutual trust, where there is a fear of no performance on either part are invalid: injustice can be none until the cause of fear be taken away.

There may be rules broken in a contract (read: covenant). He questions if taking away the fear of God may not sometimes stand with that reason. The kingdom of God is got through violence, but what about unjust violence? Is it against reason? Hobbes believes successful wickedness has obtained the name of virtue, an unreasonable action that breaks the rule of nature.

Where there is no security of performance on either side, no civil power there is no covenants - but should there be, when a man does something, Any self-respecting society that lets a man in who breaks his covenant is not using reason: a society for peace and defence should look and see. The names of Just, and Unjust, signify one thing - when attributed to actions, another. They signify conformity or inconformity of manners, to reason.

[Next few sections are cut for brevity]

The fourth law of nature: that a man who receives benefit from another of grace, has no reasonable cause to repent him of his good will, a breach of this deemed as ingratitude.
*Essentially, one must have gratitude when benefitting from one another*

The fifth law of nature is that one must endeavour to accommodate all of humankind - *COMPLEASANCE*. Followers of this law are called sociable, and otherwise Stubborn.

The sixth law of nature is this - that man must pardon those who repent, a granting of peace. Not accepting this is an aversion to peace and therefore the law of nature.

The seventh law of nature is that men must look at the greatness of the good, not of evil past - to never be cruel.

The eighth law is that one should never declare contempt

The ninth law of nature is that that man should acknowledge each other for his equal by nature.

The tenth law of nature is that is that at the entrance into peace, no man can reserve himself to any right that should not be reserved to everyone else. The observers of this law are modest, breakers - arrogant.

The eleventh law of nature is that a judge must judge men equally, as if not the controversies of men cannot be determined but by law. This is known as equity.

The twelfth law is this: everything that must be divided must do so equally.
The thirteenth law is this: ownership of things that cannot be divided is by lot or whoever first owns it. With this in mind, the fourteenth law is lot could be decided through primogeniture or first seizure.

The fifteenth law is that all men that mediate peace, be allowed safe conduct.
The sixteenth law is that everyone must submit to an arbitrator's judgement.
The seventeenth law is that no one can sit in judgement over their own causes.
The eighteenth law is that judges be impartial, and the nineteenth states that all witnesses be considered by an arbitrator. 

Essentially, 'Do not that to another, which thou wouldest not have done thy selfe.'


## CHAP. XVI. *Of* PERSONS, AUTHORS, *and things personated.*

A PERSON is one whose words or actions are considered as his own, or representing the words and actions of another man. When they are considered as his own, then he is a natural person. If they are considered to represent the words of another, they are artificial.

Of artificial people, with their words and actions owned by whom they represent, the person is the actor and the one that owns his words, the *AUTHOR*. When the actor makes a covenant by authority, he binds himself as the author.

Children and fools cannot be authors.

There are two sorts of authors: one that owns the action of another, and the other that undertakes it at another, or before, a certain time. There are called "*SURETYES.*"

```ad-quote
title: And this leads to political disorder (Leviathan, chapter 16)
"And divers men, differ not onely in their Judgement, on the senses of what is pleasant, and unpleasant to the taste, smell, hearing, touch, and sight; but also of what is conformable, or disagreeable to Reason, in the actions of common life. Nay, the same man, in divers times, differs from himselfe; and one time praiseth, that is, calleth Good, what another time he dispraiseth, and calleth Evil: **From whence arise Disputes, Controversies, and at last War**."

# PART 2

The final cause of men in the introduction of that restraint upon themselves ... is the foresight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life thereby; that is to say, getting themselves out from the miserable condition of war which is necessarily consequent, as hath been shown, to the natural passions of men when there is no visible power to keep them in awe, and tie them by fear of punishment to the performance of their covenants.

For the laws of nature as justice, equity, modesty, mercy, in sum, doing to others as we would be done to, of themselves, without the terror of some power to cause them to be observed.

For the laws of nature doing to others as we would be done to ... without the terror of some power to cause them to observed, are contrary to our natural passion, that carry us to partiality. Therefore, notwithstanding the laws of nature, if there be no power erected, every man will lawfully rely on his own strength and art for caution against all other men.

Nor is it the joining together of a small number of men that gives them this security ... small additions on the one side or the other make the advantage of strength so great as is sufficient to carry the victory, and therefore gives encouragement to an invasion.

And be there never be so great a multitude ... for being distracted in opinions concerning the best use and application of their strength, they do not help, but hinder one another.

Nor is it enough for their security, which men desire should last all the time, they they be governed and directed ... fall again into a war amongst themselves.

It is true that certain living creatures, as bees and ants, live sociably one with another and yet have no other direction than their particular judgements and appetites; nor speech.

First, men are continually in competition for honour and dignity, which these creatures are not, resulting in war.
Secondly, amongst these creatures the common good differ not from the private; and being by nature they procure thereby the common benefit. Man, whose joy is in comparing himself with other men, can relish nothing but eminent.
Thirdly creatures cannot use reason, do not see, nor think they see, any fault in the administration of their common business whereas amongst men there are very many that think themselves wiser and able to govern the public.
Fourthly, these creatures can make known their desire and other affection but they lack the art of words which some men can represent to others that which is good in the likeness of evil.
Fifthly, irrational creatures cannot distinguish between injury and damage; they are not offended with their fellows; whereas man is then most troublesome when he is most at ease; for then it is that he loves to show his wisdom and control the action of them that govern the Commonwealth.
Lastly, the agreement of creatures is natural whereas men is by covenant only.

The only way to erect such a common power is to confer their power upon one man, or one assembly of man ... acknowledging himself to be the author of whatsoever he that so beareth their person shall act, or cause to be acted.

This is more than consent, or concord; it is a real unity of them all in one and the same person. This multitude so united in one person is called a Commonwealth. This is the generation of that great Leviathan.

He that carries the power is called the sovereign.

You attain this in two ways: one, by natural force; as when a man maketh his children to submit themselves to his government as being able to destroy them if they refuse; or by war subdue his enemies to his will, giving them their lives on that condition.

The other condition is when men agree amongst themselves to submit to some man, or assembly of man.

## XVIII: Of the Rights of Sovereigns by Institution

A commonwealth is said to be made when a multitude of men do agree and ... shall be given by the major part of the right to present the person of them all ... to be their representative.

From this institution are derived all the rights and faculties of him.

First, because they're a covenant they're not to be obliged by any former covenant.

They cannot lawfully make a new covenant without the sovereign's permission.

It is injustice for a man to do anything for which he may be punished by his own authority, he is also upon that title unjust. And whereas some men have pretended for their disobedience to their sovereign a new covenant, mamde, not with men but with God, that this also is unjust. This pretence of covenant with God is evidently a lie.

Secondly, because the right of bearing the person of them all is given to him they make sovereign, by covenant only of one to another, and not of him to any of them, there can happen no breach of covenant on the part of the sovereign; and consequently none of his subjects ... can be freed from his subjections.

With the whole, as one party, it is impossible, because as they are not one person: and if he make so many several covenants as there be men, those covenants after he hath the sovereignty are void; because what act soever can be pretended by any one of them for breach thereof is the act both of themselves.

Every man has the right to defend himself, contrary to the design they had in the institution.

It is in vain to grant sovereignty by way of precedent covenant.

When an assembly of men is made sovereign, then no man imagines any such covenant to have passed in the institution. That men are not the reason to be alike in a monarchy and in a popular government proceed from the ambition of some that are kinder to the government.

Thirdly, because the major part has declared a sovereign, he that dissents must consent with the rest or be destroyed - sufficiently declared thereby his will and therefore tacitly covenanted.

Fourthly, because every subject is by this institution author of all the actions and judgements of the sovereign instituted, none of what he can do is injury or be accused of injusticed.

Fifthly, no man that holds sovereign power can justly be put to death, for seeing every subject is author of the actions of his sovereign, he punisheth another for the actions committed by himself..

Sixth, is to the sovereign to be the judge of what opinions are adverse.

There may be 'false doctrines' but at the same time, for men that are so governed they dare take up arms to defend or introduce an opinion are still in war.

Seventhly, the sovereign may prescribe what goods he may enjoy and what actions he may do.

Eighth, the sovereign is the justiciar - hearing and deciding all controversies with may arise.

Ninth, the sovereign may make war and peace with other nations. It is their ideas and choice.

Tenth, the sovereign can choose all the counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.

Eleventh, the sovereign is committed the power of rewarding with riches or honour; of punishing with corporal or pecuniary punishment or with ignominy, every subject according to the law they had made.

Lastly, considering what values men are naturally apt to set upon themselves, it is necessary to say that there be laws of honour, and a public rate of the worth of such men as have deserved or are able to deserve well in the Commonwealth.

These are the rights that make sovereignty.

The sovereign is indivisible.

Man may object that the condition of subject is miserable under unlimited power - but that's still better than the horrible calamities that accompany a civil war, or that dissolute condition of masterless men.

## XIX: Of the Several Kinds of Commonwealth by Institution, and of Succession to the Sovereign Power

The differences of Commonwealths consistent in the difference of the sovereign: a man, an assembly of men and so on.

There are three types: a monarchy, n aristocracy and a democracy.

It is manifest that men who are in absolute liberty may give authority to one man to represent them every one, as well as give such authority to any assembly of men whatsoever; and consequently may subject themselves. Therefore, where there is already erected a sovereign power, there can be no other representative of the same people, but only to certain particular ends.

The difference between these three kinds is the aptitude to produce the peace of the people. To compare monarchy with the other two, we may find that: first, that who bears the person of the people, bears his own natural person - and is careful to procure the private good of himself, his family, kindred and friends. The riches, power, and honour of a monarch arises only from the riches, strength, and reputation of his subjects.

Secondly, that a monarch can receive counsel of whom, when and where he pleases and consequently may hear the opinion of men versed in the matter about which he deliberates. When a sovereign assembly has need of counsel, none are admitted but such as have a right thereto from the beginning.

Thirdly, that the resolutions of a monarch are subject to no other inconstancy than that of human nature; but in assemblies, there may be an inconstancy from the number: for the absence of a few that would have the resolution, once taken, continue firm, or the diligent appearance of a few of the contrary opinion.

Fourth, that a monarch cannot disagree with himself, out of envy or interest, but an assembly may.

Fifthly, in monarchy there is this inconvenience that any subject may be deprived of all he possess, but at the same time this could be to a sovereign for their power is the same, and they could be subject to an evil counsel. Whereas the favourites of a monarch are few, the favourites of an assembly are many.

Sixthly, it is an inconvenience in monarchy that the sovereignty may descend upon an infant or one that cannot discern between good and evil, that their power be given to someone else. But there is still another inconvenience in putting the use of the sovereign power into a hand of a man, or an assembly of men, is to say that all governments is more inconvenient than confusion or civil war.

Should there be any contention arise to the disturbance of the public peace, it is to the ambition of subjects and ignorance of their duty. On the other side, there is no great Commonwealth, the sovereignty whereof is in a great assembly, as to consultations of peace, and war, and making of laws, in the same condition as if the government were in a child. For as a child wants the judgement to dissent form counsel given him, and is thereby necessitated to take the advice of them or him to whom he is committed.

A child is in need of a tutor to preserve their person or authority, as in great commonwealths the sovereign assembly need the dictators or protectors of their authority.

If a sovereign dies, they must provide another successor before doing so, or elect one (or give someone the power to elect one).
Secondly, that king whose power is limited is not superior to him, or them, that have the power to limit it; and he that is not superior is not supreme, not sovereign.

Thirdly, the Roman people - where people are governed by an assembly chosen out of their number, the government is called a democracy yet when they are governed by an assembly not of their choosing it is called a monarchy.

When whole assemblies die, it is necessary for the conservation of the peace of men that as there was order taken for an artificial man, that there be order also taken for an artificial eternity of his life.

There is no perfect form of government.

In a democracy, the assembly can't fall until the multitude that are to be governed fall.
In an aristocracy, when any of the assembly die, the election of another belonged to the assembly.
The greatest difficulty about the succession of right - it is not manifest who is to appoint the successor.
