## Political Obligation

Political obligation is the duty incumbent on any person or set of person legitimately subject to a legitimate political authority to obey the legitimate commands of that authority (Hobbes, pg. 32)

As an ideological concept, the modern state was constructed deliberately in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries as a decisive repudiation of the classical republic theory of citizen self-rule - but since the collapse of the French *ancien regime* in 1789, its ties sit awkwardly with its practical realities. Its moral precariousness can be reverted by going back to the conceptual contrast between the legitimate commands of a authority and illegitimate ones, or private coercion.

Every modern state presumes itself to be legitimate but since modern states are less charitable in their views of one another, they are less confident that political obligation will hold in other instances also. In this way, the universality of the claim to political obligation is really a contingency of ideological history.

This leaves the problem of political obligation is at the intellectual interests of the two main classes of theorists who still aspire to reduce modern politics to its ethical order: for those who want to discuss political protest, they focus their mind on what makes contenders for authority legitimate whereas those with interest lies in human values concentrate on the design and intellectual elaboration of those theories.

With this in mind, this is a problem that has no general solution as it removes most of the urgency from these theorems. It cannot be understood as a distinct and coherent problem at all. This judgement is not ... correct - 'the reasons for the comparative neglect ... may be apt enough in relation to the preoccupations of ... schools of modern political strategists.'

We must look at [[Hobbes, the Leviathan|Hobbes]].


Hobbes believed it was intrinsic to human existence that vulnerable, greedy, self-righteous ... creatures ... to clash over the requirements for meeting their entirely objective need for security ... their future felicity ... their still flightier conceptions of how other human beings should be permitted to live their lives.

The basis for this is around the recognition of the priority of security over all human values. All human beings set the goal for self-preservation ... above all other goals.

Security can only be guaranteed by the radical subordination of individual or group will.

The two features of this view is its: sharp focus on human vulnerability and the urgency to meet this need (which the modern political system is far too confident to discuss) and the expression of the priority of obligation over claims of human duty ... with a recognition of human subjectivity.

Arguably, no other twentieth-century thinker has contrived to represent the context of political agency in such a steady and comprehensive manner.

The reason for this is as thus: there are three distinct perspectives on the human predicaments, the first of which is radically objectified seeking a conception of the universe, the fading of these assumptions meaning contemporary philosophers disagree if the conception makes sense. Despite that, it does 'dramatize' the dense significance of political casuality.

The second is that it envisages it through the texture of social relations seen as a structure of imagination and intersubjectivity - little dynamism, identities committed to social roles. The problem of obligation loses its urgency as it becomes hard to distinguish individuals from their social and cultural obligations. Despite that, it addresses the problem of political obligation - offering an answer to the problems of practical reasons.

The third is radically subjective: the content of consciousness of individuals human agents and the world from their point of view: difficult to link this perspective with agency, but does illuminate their individual reasons.

Modern western thinkers have made extensive efforts to systematize these perspectives, uniting the first and third perspective - fusing science with subjective preferences and factor out intervening social relations by treating these as a feature of the environment of individuals or accumulations of individual subjectivity. But it is important to consider that these views aren't balanced, and each can be rejected.

One way of posing the problem of political obligation arises out of the minimalist conception of individual subjectivity and its significance - it is hard to explain why unfelt obligation can be a good reason for individual action rather than an arena of enjoyment or suffering, nor does it pose the problem which in principle palpably preclude its being *and* elides the unique character of the claim for political obedience in a world in which that claim is pressed very hard on every human being but it does address difficulties in modern standings.

Only philosophical anarchists like [[Robert Paul Wolff]] have been anxious to underline the unique character of political obedience, as he argues that it is the general duty of every human agent to retain their autonomy, assuming its validity and its incompatibility with the view that the general duty of autonomy might itself give an agent obligatory grounds for alienating their will and judgement.

We can contrast this view with that of Hobbes, in which the capacity to alienate their will through a promise is a key practical resource which human beings possess for accommodating their mutual destructive qualities in relative harmony. Hobbes believed that (whilst he hardly cared about autonomy) human beings have duties specified in his laws of nature. Critics (like Green 1988), argue it's not able to give a clear account of realising these obligation of promises, that within his ethical theory the general formal duty to judge normatively for oneself is in no way offset by any other concrete duties to each other.

In *De Cive* and *Leviathan*, Hobbes considers the problem of political obligation from the twin viewpoints of the natural individual and the alien entity to which the individual is obliged. Within this structure, the obligation of every citizen is self-incurred and externally enforced: a theory of individual good reason for action 

How far is this construction successful and identify good reasons for all human adults to constitute an effective sovereign power?

A plausible reasons revolves around how it is successful in isolating good reasons why human adults would create a sovereign power when none is present at the time, but is less good at seeing why they would submit themselves to a power when a state power currently exists. Additionally, Hobbes theory is feeble as it offers no facilities whatever for the analysis of political possibilities or political casualties. If Hobbes' formulation to the problem of obligation is the sharpest available, and the solution cannot be brought validly to bear on a choice, the implications are sceptical.

More can be learnt by considering the validity of Hobbes' theory about what is is about a state that enables it to offer human beings a dependable degree of protection - obligation self-incurred by personal commitments, the reasons to create these commitments is the character of the alien entity to which the contractors decry themselves to.

Each of these characteristics can be put into question - is the political sovereignty independent of all elements of the society over which it rules? States may be autonomous, but does it make sense to conceive the agency of a state as wholly independent of the purposes of its population? Once the independence of a society is doubted, its impartiality between these constituents become harder to credit, and neither is it easy to see how any capitalist state could be genuinely impartial between the interests of capital and labour. Real rulers possess their own tastes, the favouritism a hazard of the exercise of political power.

One interesting limitation of Hobbes's sovereign is its claim that to possess a unitary will and judgement - whilst the sovereign is entitled to take the final choice on any manner of practical dispute, entitlement does not ensure the power to make any choice in any circumstance, even modern states struggle with inertia and delay. Real sovereigns don't have a single will anyway - the Leviathan is artificial and not a natural person. Really, as time progresses the state becomes filled with bureaucracy.  ^Hobbescounterargument1

This inability to arrive at a definitive decision can be considered a failure of will on human agents.

But there is another failure of Hobbes' theory: when the latter is considered a solution for the problems of political obligation, all human beings can judge the requirements for their preservation with the consequence of not doing so being war. The principal service means they don't need to judge this for themselves - but as time progresses, the range of disasters to human life was increased, then perhaps the holders of power don't have the intelligence, unity or sagacity  necessary to prevent these disasters. In that case, states cannot supply the security that Hobbes demands. Additionally, states may lack the ability to intimidate - most contemporary commentators would agree that manifest failure to secure safety eliminates the claim of political authority for the governments such as Afghanistan and Lebanon. Can we really combine the republican thought of the right to bear arms with a Hobbesian understanding of the nature of the American state? ^Hobbescounterargument2

Hobbes theory can serve to bring out the crude disparities between the services which modern states need to be able to apply, but it does little to provide remedies - the threat of nuclear weapons, or global warming ensures that safety cannot be guaranteed. Hobbes analysis when applied would force states to conjoin would 'violently generalizes the problem of security' - and a single world government (as what would be implied to create) would run into problems of impartiality, unity of will and capacity for effective enforcement. 

There is little reasons to doubt that it is the most plausible remedy we have. Its defect is that it is an abstract idea, as Hobbes' theory is a historical actuality, and nuclear weapons have made the construction of an empire difficult.

The world we live in is a world we can't hope to distinguish those who demand political obligation and those who do not - modern conceptions of political obligation have to be limited, tentative and unlike Hobbes's simple criteria, abandoning ideas of monopoly and providing little confidence. Perhaps we can distinguish among the various types of duty, or consider the obstructions to political understanding imposed by modern philosophy.

Political obligation may be seen as an obligation of prudence, its source lying in the needs of human beings: to do so, there must be an advantage for each subject and yield real benefits. Obligations of gratitude stem from the past, the obligation of fidelity require a promise to be made, and obligation of fairness must make the practice fair... but the contrast between prudence and gratitude are difficult as prudence is fixed upon the future and gratitude are intensely more rational. How do we combine these two ideas?

Do we even want to? Both perspectives are relevant and neither is fully correct. The teleological option is best expressed in utilitarianism, a theory of value  but it yields weak grounds for individual agents to act in demand for the good. An individualist philosophy gives no justification for accepting political authority as its intrinsic form precludes it from yielding... but there is little reason whatsoever to see such a conception for yielding an adequate understanding of either nature of value or the significance of social membership, or even for a practical decisions. If human beings are social and historical creature, human value cannot be specified solely out of the contingencies of individual consciousness at a given point in time and thus the philosophy is an incredibly unappealing idea.

In the rationalized world of modern politics (Dunn 1990b), arguments will remain of urgent practical importance - in such a world's utilitarianism's conceptual impetus towards comprehensiveness retains a capacity for moral calculation. But there is no better evaluative interpretation in modern politics than any other epoch of human history -  in modern politics, the evasiveness of utilitarianism is important, but at the same time it is frustrated by the political failure of agents for almost all time.

But no agent can understand the outcome of human history and such a conception is not appropriate. What is politically possible is of central importance in political agency, but what is realistically able to be accomplished depends on the social and political responsibilities of others: it is possible to see this as a viewpoint of an agent at one place and time, but this viewpoint is a presumption and not practical.

The claims of duty can have nefarious consequences - we need not hesitate to reject them, but it's not intelligent to view authority with suspicion whenever it appears. No human beings can be exempt from responsibility for judging when a particular command is a great crime. But this responsibility is best seen not as an instance of a general duty to maximize autonomy but a duty to avoid complicity in evil acts. Human beings have great reason to distrust their capacity and reach judgements in anything, than the competence of the authority they are beholden to.

What sort of claims can political authority have today should the modern world be complex and opaque to understand?

We can take a look at the statement of Plato's teacher [[Socrates]] in the *Crito.* Political obligation can be an obligation of gratitude for benefits received, but also an obligation incurred by consent - any those who choose to remain, does so by their consent. These commitments should be easily understood - as with the people of Athens, where each citizen had a full opportunity through its political institutions to alter any law they found wrong.

All of these arguments have had their descendants: the most powerful consideration, the sheer practical expediency of political authority, makes no appearance in Socrates's account. It would be too inconvenient for any individual, if there was no settled social or economic order as it simply does not follow that most individuals most of the them have good instrumental reason to inhibit their actions on behalf of such an order. Most interpreters would choose rather to ignore it or unify this objectifying perspective from which subjectivity of reasons for individual agency.

Hobbes tried to derive comprehensive political obligation from nothing but expediency and rationality but he did not succeed. Duties of gratitude and fairness may be well-shaped to restrain the self-righteousness of an individualistic political culture but within such a culture they can only appear as moralizing external reasons and of questionable corresponding rational force. Only the individualistic criteria of consent retains a comfortable force, but it is sharply restricted by anything that could be mistaken as consent.

It is easy to construct theories of political obligation but for each theory, there must be a litany of reasons for individual action. States can do their best to impose such a theory, but theorists cannot reasonably hope to make headway through persuasion - where it succeed, it converts an external reason into an internal reason, a genuine reason for a real agent to act.

In a reasonably sedate modern policy, we can savour its sentiment with complacency... but we should not assume it is the degree to which they embody the progress of modern thought which renders them sedate and prosperous. Where their calm rhythms are disturbed, it shows a bland face as if a society amounts to nothing more than a conjunction of their individual theory, it is a war of theory against theory.

Hobbes' construction of political obligation does not offer a valid proof that we are politically obliged, but a reminder that human life is always hazardous. Mere plurality is not the solution for the riddle of modern history. For it to to aid, we need peace. Perhaps we need the Leviathan.
