This is an analysis of [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]]
## I
The Leviathan has always provoked strong and critical reactions - authoritarian monarchies have hated it and the radicals rejected the core foundations of his arguments.

From one point of view, Hobbes looks like a modern liberal with his emphasis on self-interest and representation. From a different view-point, he doesn't - he sharply opposes the kind of constitutionalism that divides and limits political powers, and attacks the institutions of what we might call civil society.

The Leviathan remains a permanent mark on the history of political thought as his viewpoints recently resurge.

## II

After King Charles dissolved parliament in 1629, he governed England for eleven years using the Royal Prerogative. As infamously known, his main problem was concerned raising revenue given that the crown lacked options without Parliament's consent and the other form of revenue, Ship Money, a tax on the coastal ties, was unpopular. Additionally James I of England had reintroduced bishops to the Church of Scotland and  so Charles was keen for further reforms to the liturgy to bring Scottish practice closer to that of England, provoking opposition in Scotland. Hobbes, as part of an initiative to create a new English parliament, came as a candidate for Derby.

His life sucked. More information if necessary.

## III

The Leviathan is principally known for its use of the *state of nature*, the natural condition of mankind. The book is known for its remark that human life would be 'nasty, brutish, short.'

The state of nature is a society lacking a political authority - 'soldiers who serve in different places and masons who work under different architects.' In this state of nature, we will devolve into war: as equals of one another, there is an undercurrent of vulnerability that surrounds our lives that inevitably creates conflict. An 'equality of ability' inevitably creates an 'equality of hope in the attaining of our Ends', and in doing so, spurs conflict through: competition (when we desire the same thing that we cannot have), diffidence (when someone concerned for their safety attacks another) and finally glory, when violence results from concern that they are not valued as highly as they believed.

This is the condition of war.

Hobbes introduces the language of the 'Right of Nature' and the 'Laws of nature' - the idea we have a right to do what we judge to be necessary for our self-preservation, and the latter discoverable from the scientific method. This 'fundamental' law is to find peace, and in the lack thereof, 'seek, and use, all helps, and advantages of warre' as we attempt to keep ourselves alive.

Therefore with this in mind, we must 'lay down' our lives to survive.

He created 19 more laws but the most interesting is the 9th. Hobbes rejects Aristotle's belief that some people were by nature stronger than others. Instead, Hobbes argues human beings constantly strive for 'power after power' whose desires cease in death. Aristotle's belief that adult men were superior in capacity than women, children and slaves to Hobbes was criminally wrong to Hobbes: humans aren't entirely antisocial, the concern over glory in the state of nature means that we must disregard said quest for glory and regard each other as equals.

We ought to live in a world in which all the laws of nature are followed by everyone but given that this is difficult (as these aren't actual laws), we must form a social contract. Therefore, we must obtain the consent of a third party to make the necessary judgement about what threats are posed to the people.

With this in mind, the sovereign builds a society through fear and submission. Additionally, the sovereign could be anybody - an individual, a group of individuals. Finally, we can become a sovereign through institution (as described) or acquisition where we acquire this through force. As we inevitably have signed away our rights, anything done to us therefore isn't injustice.

Modern politics is not Hobbesian but we use similar language of representation as ours is a 'representative democracy.' Members of the house of Commons argued that it was the Commons that represented the people and gave them authority, but Hobbes argued that it was the monarch, not the Commons, that was the true representative of the people. It didn't matter that he wasn't elected - the King was the Sovereign representative.

Sovereignty has its limits. We cannot fully squash our right of nature. We cannot give up our right of assault and force. At the outer limit of sovereignty, resistance is futile: if someone demands I send a soldier, I can pay someone to take my place.

This is somewhat similar to the prisoner's dilemma. The problems with this is that that Hobbes wanted to hone in on our *right* to behave
One of the problems with this push to reinterpret Hobbes through game theory is that Hobbes' theory's value is not easily assimilated to a rational choice perspective.

We become too interested in the 'competition' and 'diffidence' stories which become easier to model in game theory, undermining the value of glory 'Every pleasure of the mind is either glory (or a good opinion of oneself), or ultimately relates to glory' (De Cive)

Hegel dominates discussion of the moral psychology of recognition - his 1807 talk [[The Phenomology of Spirit]] with its passage on the 'master-slave dialectic.'

Jean-Jacques Rosseau called *amour-propre* from Frederick Neuhouser.

> [!quote] xxvi Introduction to Hobbes
> It is Bernard Mandeville and Kant in supplementing a crude model of self-seeking individualism with an awareness of just how powerful is our desire to have standing in the eyes of others, and the striking reflexive psychology of the constant self-policing of our actions with an eye on the responses of others to which this gives rise.

Arguably one typical objection to Hobbes argument takes aim at the importance he ascribed to glory. [[Montesquieu]] argued that ideas of empire and domination were so complex they could not be among human ambitions. [[Rosseau and the Discourse on the Origin of Inequality |Rosseau]] who was Montesquieu's disciple wrote that the men depicted in their readings were truly just civilised Englishmen.

[[Philip Pettit]] argued that Hobbes conception of nature is not offered as an account of pre-social humankind, but an account of beings that have created language - that when humans began to communicate to one another, their relations became imbued with conflict and passions inflamed.

In the event then that the proud can be forced to submit to civil government, the sovereign extinguishes their pride by dominating them. The realisation of the disparity between then and the sovereign is so vast that they are cowed into submission.

The Hobbesian thought is that promises are always made for fear of the consequences of not making them - Hobbes' Sovereign can dictate the content of our ideas of justice and determine the meaning of the words we use. 

According to Hobbes' psychology, to desire something is to be drawn towards it whereas to fear something is to shy away from it. We fear the Leviathan and this shared fear keeps human society tolerable. The passions of love can be very dangerous - doing foolish things. In the Hobbesian sate, the affectionate passions will no longer be able to disrupt the life of the wider society - confined to private areas.

Liberals today generally tend to defend civil society against the predations of the state - Hobbes judgement lead to the other direction, the aristocrats had to learn that the honour they obsessed over was simply a reflection of the honour of the Sovereign. They have no might and no authority to challenge them. Law therefore is the declared will of the Sovereign.

Hobbes was suspicious of corporate societies - 'wormes in the entrayles of natural man' and was concerned by the activities of those who were able to exploit their position to shape the ways in which the subjects thought about matters of mass important. They claimed an allegiance on Christians souls, and these Ecclesiastics were very good at manipulating the passions of love and fear in order to get people to do what they wanted them to do - persuading people to fear divine punishment after death, undermining those who make confidence in these. Hobbes worked to undermine confidence in these - those who actually witnessed the risen Christ were the authentic martyrs.

*Please note that these several paragraphs are borrowed from this book.*

Hobbes argued that the Sovereign was entitled to enforce uniformity, a state church determined by the political authority. Despite that, Hobbes argues in favour of religious freedom -  as long as religion did not leave to 'contention' then Hobbes argues that this is 'perhaps the best' as Christians can listen to the preachers they preferred and no significant church structures existing whatsoever. This is because 'there ought to be no power over the consciences of men, but of the word it selfe, working faith in every one', and second to allow man to follow reason of every man - to 'teach there is such danger in every little Errour, to require of a man endued with Reason of his own, to follow the Reason of any other man'
