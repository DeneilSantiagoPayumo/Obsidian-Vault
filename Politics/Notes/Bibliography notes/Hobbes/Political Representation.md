Hobbes's theory of representation, anti-democratic or protodemocratic?

```ad-summary
title: David Runciman:
Hobbes is both a thinker who madae representation a distinctively modern concept, emancipating it from its medieval roots and employing it to establish a clear identity for the state as a separate entity, grounding a secular conception of authority.

But it has one flaw: it is strikingly anti-democratic and it is hard to see how an anti-democratic theory can be viewed as foundational for the political world we inhabit.

In this essay, I want to argue that it is possible to close the gap between Hobbes's foundational role in the modern theory of representation and our own democratic expectations of what representation must entail.

It is important to distinguish the approach:
1. The first claim might be that Hobbes' own ideas are meant to be more democratic than argued, an example by Richard Tuck who has argued for a much fuller overlap that is commonly perceived between Hobbes's political thought and Aristotle's concept of 'extreme democacy' and Rousseau's later democratic theory.
This theory however falls flat for Hobbes theory of representation as it places the focus on Hobbes' writings in the books wherein his theory is not fully articulated.

2. Another approach is to argue that Hobbes' theory of representation exercised a strong influence on the ideas of subsequent theorists of representation whom it is possible to think of as democratic theorists in their own right. One may try to trace the influence of his theory on those like Abbe Sieyes, but the case is not straightforward as Sieyes drew on Hobbes to distinguish himself from 'crude' democratic theory.
Some theorists drawn most heavily to his theory of representation are those contemporary democrats would be less comfortable with - for instance, Carl Schmitt who hardly rescues Hobbes from the suspicion that he is not a genuine democrat.


## Hobbes on representation and authorization

Pitkin argues that Hobbes is a straightforwardly anti-democratic thinker on his theory of authorization. For Hobbes, to be the 'author' of another person's actions is to 'own' whatever actions they perform. He believed it was possible to set limits on what one person might do on the authority of another: authorizing them to act only in certain ways.

With this definition, the act of authorizing a sovereign has no limitations as there's no power in place to enforce them.

Hobbes states that the individuals who authorize a sovereign to act on their behalf must be the owners of anything and everything the Sovereign does in their name. Of course, the Sovereign may struggle to command the death of an individual: but all other subjects of the sovereign are still bound to obey that.

Hobbes' ability to let the individuals disown the actions of the sovereign is not democratic in any sense. The disowning of sovereign action is either futile (when few are threatened) or redundant (when the population has already returned them to the state of nature where political authority is void).

There is no room for individuals to say what is being done on their behalf by the sovereign.

This does not constitute the whole account of Hobbes' representation.
* He limits the description of the relationship to the terminology and ownership
* Individual acts of authorization gives the sovereign the right to 'present the Person of them all (that is, to be their representative) (121)' - ambiguous but notable in that Hobbes does not say that the sovereign represents the 'persons' of them all. Representation follows from the authorization of the sovereign but is not equivalent to it.
* When Hobbes talks about the sovereign as "representative" in Leviathan, he emphasizes that what he represents are not the separate persons of his individual subjects, but in fact the state.

This person of the state does not have the authority to act on its own behalf, which means that it does not have the authority to initiate its own acts of representation.

This is not consistent: in chapter XVI, Hobbes says that "It is the Unity of the Representer, not the Unity of the Represented, that maketh the Person *One*" (114) suggesting that individual subjects constitute the "represented".
This suggests that representation is the representation of every man in "his [own] person" rather than the representation of some group person that transcends the individual.

Hobbes argues that political representation is *not* the representation of a united multitude, but it is *not* to allow individuals to have more than one representative - both of these thinking are inherently unstable.

If one distinguishes between Hobbes's negative statements about political representations and his positive statements, then a person emerges: the authorization of the sovereign by a "multitude" of natural individuals making representation of the state possible, but neither equivalent nor reducible to it.

Why do we want to separate representation from authorization?

The answer belongs to Hobbes' understanding that his bare theory of authorization was insufficient to construct an entire account of the state. It was part of the radicalism of Hobbes's theory to found it on individuals, but he recognized that representation could not be an individualistic relationship.

To leave the sovereign as merely the representative of a series of individual actors reduces politics to personal relationships ... the concept of representation made it possible to separate out the state from the multitude.

The idea that there might be other relationships at work including the relationship between the sovereign and the commonwealth, and that of the multitude and the commonwealth that their authorization of the sovereign brings into being.

Hobbes' theory includes: personation, membership, dominion, authorization and ownership.

**Personation** - the wearing of a mask, or the inhabiting of a role so that the representation of a commonwealth makes it possible for Hobbes to describe the sovereign as 'bearing the person of the state' - but this language doesn't fit the representation of a multitude of individuals because it is impossible to see how the sovereign could wear a number of masks simultaneously.

An actor can wear one mask at a time and a succession of different masks one after the other.

To see the sovereign as personating the commonwealth at least suggests that the occupant of the office of sovereign representative is constrained by the requirements to be a plausible performing - the commonwealth is unable to constrain the sovereign, but can't act through it either.

Hobbes must consider how the multitude - the individual subjects - have relations to the state: do they have some relationship to the state given their role in its creation, and do they have a relationship to the state given the fact that they are responsible for what is done in its name: answering both questions in the negative, insisting that the person of the state is reducible to the persons of its individual members so that no independent relationship between them is conceivable.

He offers an alternate answer through these terms:

**Dominion** - Hobbes makes it clear that "incapable" entities which are represented but unable to authorize their own representation, authority lies with those who are responsible for the thing in question or brought it into being (113)

The state is an incapable entity, those who have brought it into being are the multitude, that suggests they have some latent dominion over it even if that cannot be fully realised due to the nature of the sovereign.

**Membership**: at the same time, Hobbes deploys the language of membership to describe the relationship between individual subjects and the state to which they belong. For Hobbes, this image forms part of his image of the Leviathan as the kind of body with "members" that enable it to function. Membership in this sense does not imply independent control, but it means what is done depends on the functioning of its individual members.

Three of these ideas follow from the fact that Hobbes makes the sovereign the representative of the commonwealth, not of the multitude. Taken together, they mean that commentators like Pitkin offer an account of Hobbes's theory of representation that is too narrow.

The representation of the person of the commonwealth serves to limit the ways in which the sovereign can act but it does not allow anyone to object to what the sovereign does in that role, simply setting tighter conditions for what will constitute a failure of performance and a failure of the state itself.

Personation imposes burdens on the sovereign but does not grant rights to anyone else.

Dominion might offer grounds for objection but not in the case of the sovereign who exercises control over the forms of dominion enjoyed by his subjects.

Membership can constrain the action undertaken by the representative of teh group, but not Hobbesian membership which is metaphorical and designed to illustrate that the members are conjoined with the sovereign in whatever he does.

Why is Hobbes adamant that there be no limits for the sovereign?
1. First, Hobbes was determined not to allow for the kinds of competing claims to political authority that he believed opened the door to civil war.

This is wrong, as states do not open the door to anarchy if they allow for judgement to be passed.

2. But the second answer is that Hobbes's reluctance to allow anyone the right to object to the way in which they are being represented follows from the formal structure of his theory: a state where government authority derives from individuals but is exercised in the name of the people as a whole it is difficult to see where the right to object should reside.

If it belongs with individuals, then political life becomes fragmented and on the other hand if the group is allowed to object, the individualistic basis of the theory is lost as the group becomes the source of authority of sovereign actions.

Hobbes wished to avoid this because he didn't want to bestow political rights on collective entities with no basis ... trying to strike a balance in the sense that individuals could not be the final arbiter of political judgement because that would destroy the collective life of the state.

## Hobbesian representation and representative democracy.

The problem of trying to strike a balance between the need to give the state a collective identity and the wish to avoid giving the state priority over the judgement of individuals is one that remains for democratic theories of representation.

We can learn though (from Hobbes) is the idea that whom we authorize to act for us act not in our names as individuals, but names of the state. A democratic theory of representation needs to retain the capacity of individuals to object to what is being done, while denying to individuals the right to opt in or out of political life.

If the first is lost, then authoritarianism - if the second is allowed then democracy becomes chaotic. Therefore, we must allow individuals to pass judgement on what governments do in the name of the state.

![[Pasted image 20231012164653.png]]

It makes use of Hobbes' terms but frees from Hobbes's unwillingness to give them a democratic ddimension.

Individual citizens pass judgement over government action and remove governments they o not wish of, but governments do not represent them as individuals - members of the state as a whole. In this sense, the government personates the state while individuals citizens act as a multitude retain dominion over what the governments do in the state's name.

The result is that political representation is an ongoing process that enables individuals to judge actions undertaken on behalf of a collective entity to which they belong and for which they are ultimately responsible.

This account captures a feature of how many representative democracies in fact function in practice - different systems place varying weight on individualistic representation and trade-off (with the US placing emphasis on the representation of individuals and of separate groups than other politics).

But with tax, can we see as each individual member of the state being personally represented?

There is something implausible about the idea that when a government taxes an individuals, it is representing that individuals since chances are that person concerned would prefer not to be taxed.

There's something unsatisfactory about the idea that when government taxes an individual, it is representing some other group of individuals entirely.

Governments need to act in the name of the state, or of "the people" understood as a collective entity.

What makes this democratic is that a disparate collection of individuals can still pass judgement over what governments do in the state's name, either through the ballot box or other public opinion. This shares three features with Hobbes' theory of representation:
1. It separates out authorization from representation: the individuals who give governments the power to act are distinct from the collective entity in whose name governments act
2. It treats the state as an incapable entity that needs to be represented in order to act all - the only actors on this account are citizens or the government and cannot impose its will on what governments do or how individuals judge the actions of their government. That said, the state has a necessary presence in democratic political life because its representation is the means of giving a collective identity to what would be a multitude of individuals.
3. The state is dependent on the individuals: there is no state without individuals to pass judgement, and to bear the consequences of what the sovereign does in the state's name.

Hobbes believed all groups had to be modelled on the representative structure of the state. But groups, however small, can acquire a collective identity in a variety of different ways. The authority of the group can be reduced to the authority of its individual members, establishing their identity through the joint decisions of their members, either acting unanimously or by joint agreement.

These decisions may demonstrate the consistency we desire, so the group has its own personality.

If this personality is reconciled with a presumption in favour of individual judgement by allowing individual members to exit the group if they are unhappy with its collective decisions, or to remain members but to absent themselves from personal responsibility for what the group does in their name.

Hobbes is too restrictive in how he understands group life in general does not mean he is wrong about the character of the state: states are different, not allowing individuals to exit if they are unhappy, nor to absent themselves from responsibilities for collective decisions.

The individual members of state do not display the consistency in their judgements that would enable them to be described as a collective person. This means that states can acquire their personality through the attempts of their representatives to give them a collective identity.

Another way to put this was that Hobbes was doubtful about the ability of the individual members of states to agree not merely that they need a collective identity, but what that is.

The difference can be captured by looking at the other way around the angle in Figure 1.3 - it could be argued that individuals authorized a collective version of themselves to pass judgements on the actions of representatives appointed by the group, representing them as individuals.

Hobbes is sceptic due to his reluctance on relying on individuals agreeing about the bare minimum that they needed to.

On this alternative arrangement, there has to be an agreement of the collective identity of the state to be governed, and above all how to voice its objections to the way it is being governed.

Hobbes was wrong to imagine that limitations on sovereign power would serve as recipes for disaster. It is true that the process of drawing up constitutions accords more closely to Hobbesian model than anything else: a constitutional assembly that acts in the name of a people that cannot act for itself needs its actions ratified by a vote of the population at large.

The non-Hobbesian version of popular representation depends on a Hobbesian version to get it off ground.

It must also allow for the ways in which the state is represented for the ways in which individuals can object to the representation of the state - believing it is not possible to determine in advance any constraints on government action, his conceptual scheme of representation is more open-ended than one that requires some agreement on the forms of collective action before popular representation can take place.

Because Hobbes is so suspicious of the idea that they can have an identity before being represented, he has to allow they can possess whatever identity their representatives are able to give them.

If Hobbes' account is amended to include the input of the state citizens it is consistent with democratic states - enabling governments to shape the ongoing life of the state rather than expecting them to be subordinate to it.

Hobbes reluctance to give up the idea of states having their own personaltiy has a nice ring to it: it is hard to know what states are if they are nothing but the individuals who inhabit them.

This theory enables him to combine his doubts about transcendent claims to group personality with his belief that politics must be something more than a battleground of individual wills.

## Conclusion

His theory is a way to think about the complex relationship between individuals, governments and states without falling into those same traps.

He insists its not simply individuals who are being represented; instead, it is the state that is being represented, and individuals who are involved in the process of making the representation of the state work - rescuing political representation from a struggle to reconcile the independence of political movements.

He does not explain how the views of the individuals might bear on the representation of the state - once added to Hobbes' accounts, it serves to limit the independence of political representatives without requiring them simply to represent the views of individuals.

This leaves out the ways in which individuals might want their views taken care of and played out.

It leaves out the ways in which political representatives might take up the cause of individual constituents and seek to represent them.

It does not take into account the groups other than the state the individuals want to be represented by.

Either democracy abandons the language of representation or representation abandons he idea of a national collective identity.

Hobbes believed that popular sovereignty could be reconciled with a conception of representation without placing weight on the collective identity of a multitude of separate individuals.

The problem has always been knowing
how to combine this dependence on the concept of representation with
the democratic conviction that individuals ought to be able to tell their
representatives what to do if it is going to make sense to talk about representation at all.
