# Another Realism: The Politics of Gandhian Nonviolence 
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Alough Gandhi is often taken to be an exemplary moral idealist in politics; this article seeks to demonstrate that Gandhian nonviolence is premised on a form of political realism, specifically a contextual, consequentialist, and moral-psychological analysis of a political world understood to be marked by inherent tendencies toward conflict , domination , and violence. By treating nonviolence as the essential analog and correlative response to a realist theory of politics, one can better register the novelty of satyagraha (nonviolent action) as a practical orientation in politics as opposed to a moral proposition, ethical stance, or standard of judgment. Thè singularity of satyagraha lays in its self-limiting character as a form of political action that seeks to constrain the negative consequences of politics while working toward progressive social and political reform. Gandhian nonviolence thereby points toward a transformational realism that need not begin and end in conservatism, moral equivocation, or pure instrumentalism.
```

Traditions of realism reject the search for ideal political institutions in favour of a science of politics that emphasize passion and interests versus ideal motivation and moral education.

A new call for realism has recently emerged in political theory - it too raise the charge of excessive idealism and moralism but directs it against the methods and aims of dominant contemporary political philosophy (as in the [[John Rawls]])

"Gandhian nonviolence is often taken as an exemplar of pure conviction politics. Indeed, among both critics and defenders, there is a tendency to characterise Gandhi as a moral idealist or absolutist, as someone who rejected utilitarian/Machiavellian political thinking in which ends justify means and, instead, evoked strict limits to legitimate political action." (456)

In this essay, the term "realism" to register a *theoretical* coherence in Gandhi's understanding of politics: an orientation and view of the political world that would place Gandhian politics squarely within the ambit of political realism.

Gandhi's open opposition to Machiavellian and utilitarianism brings him to another kind of realism - what distinguishes his realism from other realism is its ability to blend a negative orientation against violence with a progressive program of socioeconomic transformation.

The novelty of Gandhian *satyagraha* (nonviolent action) lies in its *self-limiting* character; it is a form of action that seeks to constrain the negative consequences of politics and work toward the reform of existing political relations.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### INTERACTION AND THE DYNAMICS OF VIOLENCE: GANDHI's THEORY OF POLITICS

#### The Problem of Idealism

"A practical orientation to politics was understood as one that turned fundamentally on the problem of political means. In politics, Gandhi contended, "means are after all everything" ([1924b] 1999, 310]); they not only shape the realization of political ends but are also implicated in the very nature of political conflict. As is often recognized, the call to scrupulously attend to the question of means was a sharp rejection of the logic of expediency in politics." (457).

"In Gandhian terms, the signature failing of political idealism is its focus on *ends* at the expense of *means* ... First, **the commitment to ideals when detached from a specification of means is subject to a distinct form of moral erosion**; namely, it can have a morally disinhibiting effect on its proponents ... The temptation to use any and all available means for even small or temporary gains seemingly becomes greater in proportion to one's belief in and attachment to ends ... Second, **idealism can facilitate tendencies toward ideological entrenchment in politics.**" (459).

"**The ways in which ends are invoked, presented, and insisted on can themselves engender resistance**; that is, they may prove counterproductive to the process of converting natural opponents to the cause of reform." (ibid).

"For instance, when political conflict is understood as a contestation over rival conceptions of the good or the just, the search for consensus or agreement becomes the presumed solution to the problem of politics. Here, **educative models, in which public reason through debate and discussion is thought to lead to the dissemination and transformation of political values, take the place of politics**. Alternatively, political theory speaks in the voice of the state or from a position of power, concerning itself with outlining legislation or policy along proposed normative guidelines ... To critics, these assumptions are taken to exemplify political philosophy, and especially contemporary liberalism, tendency toward the evasion of politics." (459)

#### Cycles of Violence

For Gandi, *himsa* is an ever-present feature of life - *himsa* is understood as harm or injury to any living being. Basic bodily functions involve *himsa* as a sign of its eradicability - "one common ethical response is the renunciation of action, an imperative to make one's footprint in the world as infinitesimal as possible and to practice a variety of forms of nonattachment to body and world. In contrast, Gandhi held to a notion of renunciation that "**should be sought for in and through action**" ([1928b] 1999, 131). The answer was not a negative withdrawal from the world, but rather **a form of detached self-less action that aimed at actively minimizing harm and suffering**." (459)

"In translating the metaphysical doctrine into avowedly social and political terms, Gandhi effectively reinvented the theory of *ahimsa* in a manner that often dismayed traditional adherents ... Gandhi was often **piqued by dogmatic forms of *ahimsa* that "made non-killing a blind fetish" and were seemingly motivated more by the care of the one's soul than the suffering of others**." (ibid) "Gandhi came to emphasize ***structural*** aspects of violence in a host of social, economic, and political institutions." (460)

"For Gandhi, political action - like all action - intervenes in a complex causal web. **Action initiates irreversible chains of cause and effect, which Gandhi understood to be so intricate as to be unknowable and therefore unmasterable in any deep or final sense.** The *political* analog of the metaphysical problem of *himsa* was therefore an understanding of politics as necessarily interactive and deeply consequentialist,** where chains of **intentionality and responsibility reverberate in unforeseen and unintended ways** ... Rather than abjuring the consequentialism of politics and recommending withdrawal, Gandhi put forward a **model of self-limiting action**, action that could do as much as possible to **internally** **constrain** these negative effects and still work toward positive political goals." (461).

"The subjective - or moral-psychological dimension - of violence is equally important in the manner of its justification. **Implicit in the turn to violence is a claim to infallibility**; according to Gandhi, however, human beings were "not capable of knowing the absolute truth and therefore, not competent to punish" ([1921b] 1999, 451]). Gandhi's objection here is often construed as an *epistemological* critique of violence, founded on a conception of truth as many-sided. Yet, for Gandhi, **the posture of infallibility was also a moral-psychological one**; it was a problem of pride and, at the same time, of weakness and cowardice. The extreme irreversibility of violence demands hubris in its undertaking ... **The fortitude that accompanies errors of judgement and policy reversals difficult and rare**." 

"Finally, **Gandhi was concerned with the long-term, unintended consequences of violence namely the ways in which violence**; namely the ways in which violence **attains moral and political legitimacy**. For Gandhi, when **coercion is deemed rightful conduct against recalcitrant opponents** or enemies ... **everyone is more inclined to become power seekers, either for protection or as emulators**, and thus all become accustomed to and accepted competitive domination as the preeminent mode of modern politics." (460)

"For Gandhi, it was not the mere preponderance of force that brought or kept India under British rule but **Indian weakness**. Emulation and the turn to violence were marks of this weakness; they demonstrated the continued acquiescence to the **logic of imperial conquest and legitimated material domination as an acceptable foundation of political authority**." (461)

#### Affect and Escalation

"**The second feature that was fundamental to Gandhi's understanding of politics was the inherent tendency towards escalation in conflict**. The problem of **escalation is closely tied to an idea of political action** that emphasizes its interactive effect in complex causal sequences ... **the performative aspect of political interaction transforms political actors' motivations and subjective investments**." (461).

There are distinct limits to rational persuasion in politics:
1. Political conflicts between landlord and peasant caste have a tendency in and through contestation, to take on an increasing ideological character.
2. "In particular **egotistic passions are activated and heightened when beliefs are questioned and contested**, as they inevitably are in the realm of politics." (461).
3. Here contestation stirs the passions that more often than not result in entrenchment and escalation rather than moderation and agreement.

Gandhi outlines the manner in which a response to injustice can easily lead to an escalation that undoes the conditions of a just resolution ... "One of the overt lessons of this story is that choosing **the improper means to respond to injustice can have united and deleterious consequences: more violence, injustice, and instability**." (461)

"One of the overt lessons of this story is **that choosing the improper means to respond to injustice can have unintended and deleterious consequences: more violence, injustice and instability**. The parable also shows how the investment in and motivation for seeking justice and redress are imbricated in the agent's sense of self such that this **investment itself becomes a vehicle for escalation and a barrier to reaching a lasting and just resolution**."

### PRINCIPLES OF NONVIOLENT ACTION

#### Means and Ends

Gandhi was aware that all political action held within itself tendencies toward escalation and latent violence ... "Therefore Gandhi's challenge was to create, define, and delineate the conditions through which nonviolent action, especially in its collective form, could mitigate these negative dynamics and repercussions." This became *satyagraha* (462).

Gandhian *satyagraha*, therefore, does not imply one set course of action or a static injunction to restrict action to nonviolence, but rather the strategic interplay of nonviolent techniques.

The most original aspect - its radically self-limiting character. I outline the defining principles of *satyagraha* in terms of the orientation, mechanism, and dispositions that render it "a force containing within itself seeds of progressive self-restraint" and thereby the capacity to attenuate coercion and escalation.

"A primary tenet of Gandhi's realism was his insistence on a means orientation to politics. This orientation serves, on the one hand, as an antidote to the kinds of disjuncture between means and ends characteristic of political idealism and of instrumentalism; on the other, it pointedly frames politics in terms of the problem and possibilities of political action." (462)

Gandhi's understanding of "convertible terms" suggests two kinds of articulation:
1. "Convertibility implies a very tight imbrication such that means would have to embody their end. In *Hind Swaraj*, for example, Gandhi offered an organic metaphor that seemingly so intertwined means and ends that no end could function as such, or ever come to light, if it were not already given in the means used to attain it."
2. "In a second and more strategic sense, **reciprocity between means and ends implies a vigilance in which it is crucial "to adopt means to fit each case" and creatively enact a variety of nonviolent methods and dispositions to overcome resistance to transformative action** ... Gandhi's varied agenda for social and economic reform illustrate well the idea that () the **means adopted determine the extent to which the goals of reform can be progressively realized**." (462) 

#### Discipline and Suffering

"For Gandhi, **suffering properly practices was noncoercive, and its mode of operation forestalled and disrupted the escalating logic of politics**. Moreover, the disposition toward sacrifice implied in suffering allowed for self-correction and self-examination, a **disciplined humility that was performed and cultivated through detached action**." (463)

For Gandhi, "the main reason why violence is eliminated" in *satyagraha* is because the *satyagrahi* (the nonviolent actor) "**gives his opponents the same right of independence and feelings of liberty that he reserves to himself and he will fight by inflicting injuries on his own person**." (463)

Suffering interrupts the dynamic and escalation of violence - it demanded the burdens of acting, ostracism to violent reactions.

For Gandhi, the mitigation of resentment was only one side of what made conscious and deliberate suffering effective. Suffering, for Gandhi, "appeals not the intellect, it pierces the heart," working not by persuading but *converting* political opponents. (463)

"Gandhi was acutely aware that an unrestrained or egotistic politics of conviction was especially liable to engender a logic of escalation. **He therefore insisted that nonviolence could not be a movement of "brag, bluster, or bluff" but rather one premised on the cultivation of "unobtrusive humility**". (464)

"Gandhi's repeated prescription to be pure and selfless in motive, coupled with his celebration of personal asceticism, have given great cause to view him as a moral absolutist or ethical purist in politics. **He certainly extolled a model of moral perfection in which disciplined purity and self-abnegating humility was central mode and avowed aims.**" (464)

### CONTEXTS OF NONVIOLENT ACTION

Gandhian realism takes the fundamental questions about politics to be questions about political action about how a particular context and set of practical constraints one must seek the right means to enable a projected end.

I have focused on *constraints* in terms of recurring structures of resistance. Action also takes place within determinate relationships and encounters, in which individuals and groups confront and engage each other from a given standpoint.

Context is an essential, even determinative, starting point of political action and judgement. Gandhi's understanding of satyagraha offers definite parameters or precepts for determining the appropriate course of action in given contexts.

#### Destructive and Constructive *Satyagraha*

"**Destructive *satyagraha* revolves around the tactics of civil disobedience and non-cooperation. It is a mode of militant and direct political action against unjust laws or an unjust political order, an order with which you are in, or place yourself in, an antagonistic relationship.** By contrast, constructive nonviolent action is driven less by an urgency to resist, withdraw, or undo existing political authority... Constructive action can also **function as a form of political judgement, linked to an ethics of effective leaderships**." (465)

Nonviolent resistance in the form of mass civil disobedience is an example that political authority is based on some kind of consent. "Unjust laws and regimes can be radically destabilized by acts of withdrawal of that consent, through a politics of active noncooperative with authority." (ibid)

Constructive *satyagraha* was the **necessary flipside of nonviolent resistance and non-cooperation** - For Gandhi, the exemplary site for experimenting with constructive *satyagraha* was the platform of village reform and revitalization known as the "Constructive Programme." - social, cultural and economic reform campaigns, cottage industries, striving for communal harmony.

The forms of satyagraha envisioned in the constructive program were  meant to highlight the centrality of, and imitate a model for the everyday practice of nonviolent politics. These campaigns explicitly eschewed state action or legislation as the means for effecting radical social and economic reform.

```ad-quote
title: 466
Gandhi's proposed antidote to the potential escalating spiral of ideological conflict inherent in communal, intercaste, and economic conflict was the radical localization of the arena of struggle for reform. While national in scope, the constructive program was to be conducted as village-level campaigns. **For Gandhi, entrenched forms of economic and social oppression (for example, stemming from land distribution and caste inequality) required engagement at an intimate scale, because intimacy set the conditions for conscious atonement and resisted the abstracting logic of ideological competition and stalemate.** In a positive sense, localized **constructive nonviolence taught satyagrahis to orient themselves toward the reform of that with which they were most intimate; that is, it insisted that political action began from the situatedness of the self in its most intimate worlds**.
```

One of the most striking examples is in the realm of political judgement and political leadership was Gandhi's understanding of conditions for forging Hindu-Muslim unity. 

```ad-quote
title: 466
Ria (2002) and Devji (2005) have both drawn attention to the novelty of Gandhi's formulation of **political friendship** as one that is performed through **unconditional acts of solidarity**. Rather than a strategic alliance of interest, based on a kind of quid pro quo - in which, for instance, Hindu support for the Khilafat demand would be tied to Muslim acceptance of a ban on cow slaughter - Gandhi attempted to "win permanent friendship with Mussulmans" in "a spirit of love and sacrifice independent of expectation of any return" ([1920 f] 1999, 119). What Gandhi proposed was not primarily an ideology (or national narrative) that could convince Hindus and Muslims that they shared political interests an goals (or that they already formed a single political community) but a **mechanism that could disarm growing enmity and escalating distrust**.

![[Pasted image 20240220004649.png]]
```

Here we see the central mechanisms of *satyagraha* mobilized towards creating the conditions for mutual respect, trust and equality - a sensitivity to the nature of the structural and historical relationships between Hindus and Muslims - it was premised on the heightened duty of the Hindu community as the majority community to "surrender out of strength to the Mussalman in every mundane matter." 

#### Context and Coercion

Satyagraha as dramatizing self-suffering - the price for acting was borne by the Satyagraha and whatever coercion was internally directed and thus not a form of violence against the opponent.

"To demonstrate this quality of nonviolence, **Gandhi often invoked a distinction between forms of political boycott in which one legitimately withdrew support from an unjust institution** (i.e., through disobeying or ignoring the laws of the village headman or district collector) and **extreme forms of social boycott that would deny social services or otherwise ostracize or intimidate these same officials**. In satyagraha one did not punish the wrongdoer as such; rather **one "must combat the wrong by ceasing to assist the wrong-doer"** ([1920 c] 1999, 399). Gandhi deemed **punishment** to be outright **coercion** and hence **Illegitimate**. Moreover, in terming the act "coercive" Gandhi also considered it to be **politically ineffective** because it targeted individuals rather than **institutions** and, importantly, accelerated the given dynamics of **Entrenchment**" (467)

(Punishing the institution - worsens entrenched dynamics)

Gandhi declared satyagraha to be a militant and not passive form of resistance, invoking military metaphors.

We can look at the fast: he was reluctant to try this tactic and knew fasts could become easily coercive - "For Gandhi, fasting against a political antagonist or enemy functioned only to escalate bitterness and conflict, because **one's enemy would necessarily experience the fast as exhortative and coercive**. One could not "**fast against those whose consciousnesses could be stirred by the willingness to sacrifice one's life** ... Only in the context of that kind of relationship ... would fasting work as a moral persuasion and not as sheer blackmail."
