# From the ruins of empire, the revolt against the West and the remaking of Asia
### Rabindranath Tagore in East Asia, the Man from the Lost Country

#### What were the key points of this chapter?

For many Chinese in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, India was seen as a lost country whose internal weakness was exploited by foreign invaders and forced it into a state of subjugation. (108)

"As the Chinese saw it, foreigners had ruled the country continuously since the Mughals established their empire in the sixteenth century; there was no native ruling class capable of unifying the country." (109)

Rabindranth Tagore was born out of the new Indian intelligentsia, exposed to a range of Western thought and influenced by 'social reform' movements.

Gandhi wrote a manifesto that summed up intellectual arguments against the West. He attacked those who saw salvation in the imitation of Western-style state and society. "Gandhi saw that these nationalists would merely replace one set of deluded rulers in India with another: 'English rule', he wrote in *Hind Swaraj*, 'without the Englishman.'" (111)

"Gandhi eagerly acknowledged the many benefits of Western modernity, such as civil liberties, the liberation of women and the rule of law. Yet he saw these as inadequate without a broader conception of spiritual freedom and social harmony. Yet he saw these as inadequate without a broader conception of spiritual freedom and social harmony." (111)

"However, the terms of Gandhi’s critique, as set out in Hind Swaraj, were remarkably original. He claimed that modern civilization had introduced a whole new and deeply ominous conception of life, overturning all previous notions of politics, religion, ethics, science and economics. According to him, the Industrial Revolution, by turning human labour into a source of power, profit and capital, had made economic prosperity the central goal of politics, enthroning machinery over men and relegating religion and ethics to irrelevance. As Gandhi saw it, Western political philosophy obediently validated the world of industrial capitalism. If liberalism vindicated the preoccupation with economic growth at home, liberal imperialism abroad made British rule over India appear beneficial for Indians – a view many Indians themselves subscribed to. Europeans who saw civilization as their unique possession denigrated the traditional virtues of Indians – simplicity, patience, otherworldliness – as backwardness." (112)

title: On Tagore 115
"In retrospect, Tagore, angrily recoiling from the main intellectual and political trends in Japan and China, seems to have misunderstood their context. He may have been too influenced by the Indian model, in which the British were in charge of military and political affairs, and the Indians could devote themselves to spiritual leadership. From the perspective of the Chinese and the Japanese, who had to build their nations from scratch, a people who did not worry about their political subjugation and spoke instead of spiritual liberation were indeed very ‘lost’.

At the same time, to see Tagore as an uncompromising foe of Western knowledge was to seriously misread his worldview. As late as 1921, he was writing disparagingly about Gandhi’s freedom movement to a friend: ‘Our present struggle to alienate our heart and mind from the West is an attempt at spiritual suicide.’ Nor was Tagore an apolitical mystic from a lost country. He was more than alert to the Chinese sense of shame and humiliation. Passing through Hong Kong on his way to Japan in 1916, he had deplored the ‘religion of the slave’ that made a Sikh assault a Chinese labourer. Speaking of Indian collaborators with British imperialists, he lamented that ‘when the English went to snatch away Hong Kong from China, it was they who beat ‘China … they have taken upon [themselves] the responsibility of insulting China’."

Thus ended the dream of a regenerated Asian spiritual civilization. Certainly **‘spirituality’ had proved too vague a word; it could readily indicate the warrior spirit of the samurai as well as the self-control of the Brahman.** There was also something fuzzy about the notion that Asian countries were joined together by immemorial cultural links established by the export of Buddhism or Chinese culture from their origin countries to the furthest peripheries of Asia.

### CHAPTER 2: Asia Remade
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

Pan-Asianism was important not in what it did for Japan but in what it allowed others to do, and the unintended consequences that flowed from Japan's actions.

Politically the most prominent of these critics of Western modernity and reinventors of tradition was, of course, Gandhi. Gandhi could see how the unprecedented moral disasters of the modern age – the Western scramble for colonies in Asia and Africa, the world wars between rival nations and empires, the rise of totalitarianism – **worked out the nihilist logic of a purely secular and materialistic outlook: that nothing is sacred in the battle for worldly power, and that nation-states with economies built around the endless multiplication of individual desires are likely to wage the most destructive wars in order to maintain their chosen ways of life.** (124)

Nowhere were traditionalist ideals so strenuously invoked against the onslaught of modernity as in the Muslim world. The course of history seemed to violate the Muslim sense of a world order shaped exclusively by God. (125)

"Islam" and "the West": those were the dichotomies al-Afghani invented. They attested to no simple opposition but a fundamental imbalance of power. **Internally weak, the world of Islam was threatened from outside. Yet its own belief in the divinely guided society and prescribed notions of social good survived the confrontation with a socio-economic order predicated on individual self-interest** ... Nostalgia for the old world of Islam overcame some of the most brilliant and cosmopolitan men in the Muslim world, such as the Indian Muslim poet Muhammad Iqbal, the intellectual and spiritual father of Pakistan. (125)

Nationalism grew purchase, the idea of self-determination came into view. Decolonization did not undercut the power of popular Islam - in Pakistan, the notion of Islam defining a national community eventually complicated the secular intentions of the country's founder, Jinnah.

"**The most striking aspect of the Muslim world in the second half of the twentieth century had been the outbursts, frequently fanatical, of deeply politicized Islam in both Sunni and Shiite lands** ... Despite different political contexts, these Islamist groups had in common an idea of Islam as a framework for moral reform as well as a revolutionary ideology and an identity. They identified their adversaries as repressive indigenous state and local elites, which in turn were seen as part of a larger, remote and menacing entity called ‘the West’." (128)"

Thus, the West had to be rejected in total - no longer a source of good or bad things.

title: Qutb 129-130
n the 1930s, Sayyid Qutb emerged as a critic of British interference, the growing inequalities in Egypt, and the Egyptian inability to support Palestinian Arabs against Zionist settlers. He broke with his liberal mentors, and as anti-colonial movements intensified in India, Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia and Kenya Qutb despaired at Egypt’s ‘native collaborators’.43 His anguish deepened with the establishment in 1948 of the state of Israel, which the systematic murder of 6 million Jews had made a moral imperative for many Western nations. In the war that followed, the Zionists defeated the combined Arab armies, expelled hundreds of thousands of Arab inhabitants of Palestine, and proclaimed an independent state. This constituted a radical defeat for Egypt in particular – the most modern of Arab nations – and Israel became, and has remained, a symbol of Arab impotence against Western power.

Israel’s victory and Egypt’s military humiliation in 1948 were major milestones in Qutb’s new thinking, as was his trip later that same year to the United States, then the embodiment of post-war modernity. This was where Qutb first began to develop his **larger critique of Western civilization as unhealthily obsessed with material and technological progress to the detriment of moral freedom and social justice.**

Like Liang Qichao, Qutb found little in the American model of politics and society to recommend back home. Democracy was unworkable in his view, not because it assumed an educated and aware citizenry **but because it made human beings the final source of sovereignty, rather than God**. Furthermore, the idea that the **good life was to be defined in terms of economic well-being became repugnant to Qutb**, and also discredited Marxism in his eyes. American expressions of **social liberalism and individualism** – sexual freedom in particular – appalled him even more. Racism, of which he encountered the anti-Arab variant as well as the traditional version, struck Qutb as an essential feature of America’s material plenitude, generated by the ‘conceit’ that this was ‘the White Man’s endowment’. He freely employed the words ‘white man’ as an epithet thereafter: ‘We must nourish in our school-age children sentiments that open their eyes to the tyranny of the white man, his civilization, and his animal hunger.’

He found himself imprisoned and tortured. Given a brisk trial - he extended a conventional critique of corrupt Middle Eastern regimes and failed modernization into an indictment of all those Western ideologies that banished religion and morality from the realm of politics.

As it turned out, most Iranians, who saw the corrupt and repressive shah as a tool of American interests, sought political redemption through their faith. The experience of deprivation, loneliness and anomie had made many Muslims in urban centres turn towards rather than away from Islam. The shah alienated them even further with his brutal attempt to create a dictatorship, following the then-fashionable theory outlined by the American social scientist Samuel Huntington, according to which **premature democracy in modernizing Third World countries created chaos rather than political stability, undermining the rule of law and the possibility of economic and social development.** (133)

title: 141-142
In the end, Western efforts to modernize supposedly backward Asians, however sincere or altruistic, incited more resentment than admiration or gratitude. **Expelled from their old social and political orders and denied dignity in a West-dominated world, aggrieved natives always wanted to beat the West at its own gam**e. This is the point that the Chinese intellectual in André Malraux’s prophetic novel The Temptation of the West (1926) makes when he says, ‘Europe thinks she has conquered all these young men who now wear her garments. But they hate her. They are waiting for what the common people call her “secrets”.’ Many of these secrets are now in Asian hands.

Television and the internet, and in particular the growth of virtual communities, have helped stoke an unprecedented intensity of political emotion around the world. **It is no exaggeration to say that millions, probably hundreds of millions of people in societies who have grown up with a history of subjection to Europe and America** – the Chinese software engineer and the Turkish tycoon, as well as the unemployed Egyptian graduate – derive profound gratification from the prospect of humiliating their former masters and overlords, who appear uncompromisingly wedded to their right to dictate events around the world. The images from Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, the deep Western financial crisis, and the brutal but inept military actions in Afghanistan and Pakistan all sustain a powerful sense of Western hypocrisy, failure and retrenchment.

Globalization, it is clear, does not lead to a flat world marked by increasing integration, standardization and cosmopolitan openness, despite the wishful thinking of some commentators. Rather, **it reinforces tribalist affiliations, sharpens old antipathies, and incites new ones while unleashing a cacophony of competing claims**. This can be seen most clearly today within Europe and the United States, the originators of globalization. Inequality and unemployment grow as **highly mobile corporations continually move around the world in search of cheap labour and high profits, evading taxation and therefore draining much-needed investment in welfare systems for ageing populations**. Economic setbacks, the prospect of long-term decline and a sense of political impotence stoke **a great rage and paranoia among their populations, directed largely at non-white immigrants, particularly Muslims**.

### Epilogue: An Ambigious Revenge

Yet this success conceals an immense intellectual failure, one that has profound ramifications for the world today and the near future.

It is simply this: no convincingly universalist response exists today to Western ideas of politics and economy, even though these seem increasingly febrile and dangerously unsuitable in large parts of the world. Gandhi, their most rigorous critic, is a forgotten figure within India today. Marxism-Leninism lies discredited and, though China’s rulers increasingly make gestures towards Confucian notions of harmony, China’s own legacy of ethical politics and socio-economic theory remains largely unexplored. And even if it is exportable to other Muslim countries, Turkey’s Islamic modernity doesn’t point to any alternative socio-economic order.

The ‘Washington Consensus’ may lie in tatters, and Beijing’s Communist regime mocks – simply by persisting as long as it has – Western claims of victory in the Cold War and the inevitability of iberal democracy. But the ‘Beijing Consensus’ has even less universal application than its Washington counterpart; it sounds suspiciously like merely a cynical economic argument for the lack of political freedom. (145-146)

These Asian beneficiaries of globalization project an image of a confident and self-aware people moving as one towards material fulfilment and international prominence. But India displays even more garishly than China the odd discontinuities induced by economic globalization: how by fostering rapid growth in some sectors of the economy it raises expectations everywhere, but by distributing its benefits narrowly, it expands the numbers of the disenchanted and the frustrated, often making them vulnerable to populist and ethnocratic politicians. At the same time the biggest beneficiaries of globalization find shelter in such aggressive ideologies as Hindu nationalism.
The feeling of hopelessness and despair, especially among landless peasants, has led to militant communist movements of unprecedented vigour and scale – the Indian prime minister describes them as the greatest internal security threat faced by India since independence.
