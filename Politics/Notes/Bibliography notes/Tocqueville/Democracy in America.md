## V1, P1, C3: SOCIAL STATE OF THE ANGLO-AMERICANS 111

The social state is the product of a fact, sometimes of laws, most often united.

The social states of the Americas is democratic.

I have made known the reasons that prevented anyone from being able to establish a powerful aristocracy in America. To the southwest of the Hudson, nevertheless had less power there than east of that river. To the south one man alone, with the aid of slaves, could cultivate a great extent of land - wealthy landed property owners, not aristocratic as they had no privileges and slaves gave no patronage.

It was estate law that made equality take its last step. They take hold of political laws and have a uniform manner of operating on society.

What estate law permits is that it orders equal partition of father's good among all the children. By virtue of estate law, the death of each property owner brings a revolution in property: goods change nature and are fragmented into smaller portions.

In countries where legislation establish equality of partition, goods and particularly territorial fortunes will have a tendency to diminish. The effects of this legislation would make themselves felt only in the long term if the law were abandoned to its own forces.

Equality acts on the very souls of property owners and call their passions to its aid. 

Estate laws destroy the intimate connections that exist between the spirit of the family and preservation of the land. Estate law make it difficult for families to preserve the same domains intact and it takes from them the desire to make the attempt. By these two manners it succeeds in attacking landed property and making families disappear with rapidity.

Fortune turns (in the U.S) with incredible rapidity and experience teaches that it is rare to see two generations collect its favours.

Equality extends to intelligence itself. Primary instruction is within reach, higher instruction within no one. Almost all Americans are comfortable and can procure for themselves the first elements of human knowledge. In America, most of the rich have begun by being poor - the result is that when one could have the taste for study, one has no time to engage in it.

Any class with penchant for intellectual pleasures is transmitted with comfort and inherited leisure, holding the works of intellect in honour.

The aristocratic element is weakened since intellectual inequality from God and everyone has the same number of notions in learning, so the aristocratic element is weakened.

...

There is a manly and legitimate passion for equality that incites men to be strong and esteemed. But freedom is not the principle object of their desire - they dash towards freedom with a sudden impulse and nothing can satisfy them without equality.

If all citizen are equal, it is difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power.

## V1, P1, C4: ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA 118

In America, the principle of the sovereignty of the people spreads with freedom and reaches its final consequences without obstacle.

The American Revolution broke out: the dogma of the sovereignty of the people came out from the township and took hold of the government. All classes committed themselves to its cause and triumphed in its name.

As one moves the limit of electoral rights back, one feels the need to move it back more. The forces of democracy increase and its demand grow with its new power.

Nothing like this is seen in the United States. There, society acts by itself and on itself - the people participate in the drafting of laws by the voice of the legislators. The people reign over the American political world as does God over the universe.

## V1, P1, C5: NECESSITY OF STUDYING WHAT TAKES PLACE IN THE PARTICULAR STATES BEFORE SPEAKING OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION 121

I propose to examine in the following chapter what, in America, is the form government founded on the principle of the sovereignty of the people; what are its means of actions, its encumbrances, its advantages and its dangers.

First: the US has a complex constitution, twenty-four little sovereign nations. The great political principles that govern society were born and developed in the state. It is the state that one must have the key to all the rest.

States that make the union present the same spectacle: township, county, state.

**TOWNSHIP**:

*On the township system in America*
1. A township society exists among all people, a place where men are gathered
2. Townships are most exposed to the invasions of power - an institution will struggle against a government
3. Eludes the effort of man
4. The force of free peoples reside - the institutions of a township are to freedom what primary schools are to science; they put it within the reach of the people ... spirit of freedom.

*Powers of the township in New England*
- People are the source of social powers but nowhere do they exercise their power more immediately
- Legislative and governmental action is brought closer to the governed, the law of representation is not accepted - there is no municipal council.
- The selectmen alone have the right to convoke the town meeting but one can induce them to do it. If ten property owners conceive a new project and want to submit it to the consent of the township.

*On township existence*
- The principle of the sovereignty of the people hovers over the whole political systems of the Anglo-Americans
- He obeys society not because he is inferior but because union with those like him appears useful to him and know that unions cannot exist without a regulating power
- He is a subject - only himself remains master, he is the best and only judge of his particular interest
- One sees the townships of New England sell and buy, attack and defend themselves before the courts, burden the budget or relieve it, without having any administrative authority whatsoever think of opposing it.
- Held responsible for satisfying social duties  - the existence of the obligation, strict but individual with the township

*On the spirit of the township in New England*
- To advantages: independence and power. They excite men's interest.
- Men's affections are bought only where there is force.
- The federal government confers power and glory on those who direct it but the men to whom it is given to influence its destinies are very few in number.
- How many men thus exploit the power of the township for their profit and take interest in it for themselves!
- The American system partitions municipal power among a great power of citizens but does not fear to multiply the duties of a township either. Life in a township makes itself felt in a way at each instance: it manifests itself each day by accomplishment of a duty.
- Nationalism - the inhabitant of New England is attached because it is strong and independent, he loves it because he has nothing to complain of in his lot. He places his ambition and his future in it - he mingles in each of the incidents of township life.

*On administration in New England*

- The absence of what is called among us government or administration: we see written laws, we perceive their daily execution and we don't discover the motor.
- There are two means of diminishing the force of authority in a nation.
- The first is to weaken power in its very principle by removing from society the right or the ability to defend itself in certain cases - to weaken authority is called founding freedom (Europe)
- Dividing the use of its forces among several hands, multiplying officials while allocating to each of them all the power of what he is destined to execute - one encounters peoples whom this division of social powers can also bring to anarchy
- The revolution in the US was caused by a taste for freedom
- They impose social obligations than elsewhere, they limit themselves to dividing it in its exercise
- There is no country in the world where the law speaks a language as absolute as in America
- The administrative power of the United States offers in its constitution nothing central or hierarchical
- It is municipal magistrates who by themselves and without needing to receive an impulse from outside, provide for those unforeseen needs societies feel.

...

To sum up in a few words:
Should the public officials of New England commit a crime, tribunals are called to dispense justice.
Should he commit an administrative fault an administrative tribunal is charged with punishing him.
Should they both attack him, his power departs from him with his mandate.

American legislators show little confidence in human honesty. They suppose man to be intelligent.

~~*General ideas about administration in the US*

**STATE**:
The legislative power of the state is entrusted to two assemblies: the senate that takes part in administration and concurs in the choice of officials that it ordinarily enters the sphere of executive power, participating in judicial power by pronouncing on certain political offenses and ruling in certain civil cases.

Two houses - elected in the same citizen. The only difference: the term of senators is longer than that of representatives.

In granting senators, the law has taken care to maintain among the legislators a core of men habituated to the business.

By dividing the legislative body into two branches, Americans slow the movement of political assemblies and create a court of appeal for the revision of law. Time and experience shows that the division of legislative powers is still a necessity of the first order.

*On the executive power of the state*
The governor of the state represents the executive power but he exercises some of its rights.
The governor gathers the military power. It is an elective magistrate. They take care to elect him only one or two years, so that he remains a strict dependence on the majority that created him.

*On the political effects of administrative decentralization in the United States*
Centralization is a word that is constantly repeated in our day and seeks to clarify.

Two kinds of centralization: to concentrate the power to direct the first in the same place or in the same hand is to found what I call governmental centralization. To concentrate the power to direct the second in the same manner is what is called administrative centralization.

Governmental centralization acquires an immense force when it is joined to administrative centralization: it habituates men to make a complete and continual abstraction from their wills.

I cannot conceive a nation can live or above all prosper without strong governmental centralization - it is fit only to enervate the peoples who submit to it, diminishing the spirit of the city in them.

One should be careful to say that a state cannot act because it has no centralization.

In the United States, governmental centralization exists to the highest point. It would be easier to prove that national power is concentrated there than it was in any old monarchies of Europe. In America, legislature of each state has no power capable of resisting it. Nothing can stop it on its way. It has no limits in its actions than its own will.

Weakness - no armed force to put down minorities, minorities have never been reduced to making war, necessity of an army has still not been felt.

It is is not because there is no centralization in the US that the republics of the New World will perish - often it comes to lack wisdom (social power) because it can do everything.

Administrative decentralization produces several diverse effects:
- As the state has no administrative officials on its own, the result is that it does not need to establish general rules of order.

The collective force of citizens will be more powerful to produce social well-being than the authority of government.

A central power cannot gather to itself all the details of the life of a great people - such a work exceeds human strength. It contents itself with an incomplete result.

Centralization succeeds in subjecting the external actions of man to a certain uniformity that in the end one loves for itself, independent of the things to which it applies - centralization succeeds without difficulty, repressing disorders and small offences, maintaining society in a status quo.

Centralization - you shall act as I wish, as long as I wish, and in the direction that I wish.

One will never encounter genuine power among men except in the free concurrence of wills - nothing in the world but patriotism or religion that makes universality of citizens advance for long toward the same goal.

One depend on laws to interest men in the destiny of their country - to awaken and direct that vague instinct of the native country, binding it in daily thoughts to make a lasting sentiment.

What we admire in America is its political effects of decentralization - the native country makes itself known everywhere. He is glorified in the glory of the nation.

We cannot rely solely on administrative authority.

One does not believe that the duties of particular persons have ceased because the representatives of the public come to act - each person guides, supports and sustains it.

In America, the means that are put at the disposal of authority to uncover crimes and prosecute criminals are few.

148 A democracy without provincial institutions possesses no guarantee against such evils. How make a multitude support freedom in great things when it has not learned to make use of it in small ones?

No nations are more at risk of falling under the yoke of administrative centralization than those whose social state is democratic.

The permanent tendency of these nations is to concentrate all power in the power that directly represents the people. When the same power is already vested with all the attributes of government, it is difficult for it not to seek to enter into the details of administration, hardly ever fails to find the occasion to do it in the long term.

I heard citizen attribute the greatness or the prosperity of their native country to a multitude of reasons. It is only people who have few institutions who deny their utility.

## V1, P1, C6: ON JUDICIAL POWER IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ACTIONS ON POLITICAL SOCIETY 150

... I have skipped a lot of this. 198

I have shown what advantages the American derive from the federal system.

One finds in the federal system accidental vices born of laws; those can be corrected by legislators. One encounters others inherent in the system that cannot be destroyed by peoples who adopt it. These peoples must find in themselves the necessary force to tolerate the natural imperfections of their government.

Among each vices - the complications of the means that it implies. The federal system rests on a complicated theory whose application requires of the governed a daily use of the enlightenment of their reason.

Only simple conceptions take hold of the minds of the people - a false idea, but one clear and precise, will have more power in the world than a true but complex idea. Hence it is that parties, which are like small nations in a great one, hasten to adopt for a symbol a name or a principle that often represents only very incompletely the goal that they propose and the means they employ. Governments that rest only on a single idea are not the best but the strongest and most lasting.

When one examines the Constitution of the United States, the most perfect of all known federal constitutions, one is frightened, on the contrary, by the quantity of diverse knowledge and by the discernment that it suppose in those whom it must rule.

The general theory being well understood, the difficulties of application remain they are innumerable, for the sovereignty of the Union. Everything is conventional and artificial in such a government, and it can be suitable only for a people long habituated to directing its affairs by itself.

The most fatal of all vices that I regard as inherent in the federal system itself is the relative weakness of the government of the Union.

The second and most fatal of all the vices that I regard as inherent in the federal system itself is the relative weakness of the government of the Union.

The principle on which all confederation rest is the fragmentation of sovereignty. The legislator make this fragmentation little felt; they even keep it out of sights for a time.

The sovereignty of the Union is the work of art - the sovereignty of the states is natural; it exists by itself without effort, like the authority of the father of a family.

Beyond material interest man also has ideas and sentiments. In order that a confederation subsist for a long time, it is no less necessary that there be homogeneity in the civilization than in the needs of the various peoples.

As long as it only a question maintaining the peace in the interior of a country and of favouring its prosperity, skill in the government, reason in the governed, and a certain natural attachment that men almost always always have for their native country can easily suffice: but for a nation in a position to make a great war, citizens must impose numerous and painful sacrifices on themselves.

In the federal system not only is there no administrative centralization or anything that approaches it but government centralization itself exists only incompletely, which is always a great cause of weakness when one must defend oneself against peoples in which it is complete.

The great happiness of the United States is therefore not to have found a federal constitution that permits it to sustain great wars. No one can appreciate more the advantages of a federal systems.

The people that, face to face with the great military monarchies of Europe, would fragment its sovereignty.

### V1, P2, C1: HOW ONE CAN SAY STRICTLY THAT IN THE UNITED STATES THE PEOPLE GOVERN 206

In America, the people name those who make the law and those who execute it; they themselves form the jury that punishes infractions of the law. The people name their representatives directly and generally choose them every year to keep them dependent.

In the United States, it is the majority that governs in the name of the people. It is composed principally of peaceful citizens who desire the good of the country. 

### V1, P2, C4: ON POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES 220

America is the one where they have taken most advantage of association and where they have applied that powerful mode of action to a greater diversity of objects.

The inhabitant of the United States learns from birth that he must rely on himself to struggle against evils of life. They will unite to resist wholly intellectual enemies: they fight intemperance in common. In the United States, they associate for the goals of public security, of commerce and industry, of morality and religion.

The right of association being recognised, citizens can use it in different manners: an association consists solely in the public adherence.

The second degree in the exercise of the right of association is the power to assemble. When one allows a political association to place centre of action at certain important points of the country, its activity becomes greater.

Finally, there is a last degree in the exercise of the right of association in the political matters: partisans of the same opinion can gather in electoral colleges and name agents to go to represent them in a central assembly.

Let me suppose a people who are not perfectly habituated to the use of freedom or in whom profound political passions are in ferment. I place a minority that is charged solely with considering and stops before pronouncement and I cannot help believing that public order is exposed to great hazards.

One must recognize that unlimited freedom of association political matters has up to the present not produced the dire results in the United States that one could perhaps.

In our time, freedom of association has become a necessary guarantee against the tyranny of the majority. In the United States, once a party has become dominant, all public power passes into its hand; its particular friends occupy all the posts and all organized forces are at its disposal. As the most distinguish men of the opposing party are unable to get over the barrier that separates them from power, they must surely be able to establish themselves,

The omnipotence of the majority appears to me such a great peril for the American republics that the dangerous means used to limit it seem to me even a good.

One cannot conceal from oneself that unlimited freedom of association in political matters is, of all freedom, the last that a people can tolerate. If it does not make it fall into anarchy, it makes it so to speak touch it at each instant. This freedom, dangerous as it is, nevertheless offers guarantees on one point: in the country where associations are free, secret societies are unknown.

After the freedom to act alone, the most natural to man is that of combining his effort with the efforts of those like him and acting in common. The right of association therefore appears to me to be almost as inalienable in its nature as individual freedom. The legislator cannot wish to destroy it without attacking society.

Political associations in the United States are therefore peaceful in their objects and legal in their means; and when they claim to wish to triumph only through laws they are generally telling the truth.

What still brings us to see freedom of associations only the right to make war on those who govern is our inexperience as regards freedom. The first idea that presents itself to the mind of a party, but of all causes that cooperate in the United States to moderate the violence of political association, perhaps the most powerful is universal suffrage.

The moral force of the government that they attack is much increased by this; theirs, much weakened.

Americans have also established a government within associations; but it is, if I can express myself so, a civil government. Individual independence finds its part there: as in society all men in it march at the same time toward the same goal; but each one is not required to march to it exactly on the same path.

### V1, P2, C6: WHAT ARE THE REAL ADVANTAGES THAT AMERICAN SOCIETY DERIVES FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF DEMOCRACY 252

*On the general tendency of the laws under the empire of American democracy, and on the instinct of those who apply them.*
The vices and weaknesses of the government:

The laws of American democracy are often defective or incomplete - they happen to violate acquired rights or to sanction dangerous ones.

The laws of democracy generally tend to the good of the greatest number for they emanate from the majority of all citizens.

The means of democracy are therefore more imperfect than those of aristocracy: often it works against itself, without wanting to; but its goal is more useful. The great privilege of the Americans is to have **repairable mistakes.**

Some argue that American democracy is often mistaken in the choice of the men in whom it entrusts power; but it is not so easy to say why the state prospers in their hands.

The real advantage of democracy is to serve the well-being of the greatest number.

Those charged with directing the affairs of the public are often inferior in capacity and morality to the men that aristocracy would bring to power - their interest intermingles and is identified with that of the majority of their fellow citizens. They will never systematically follow a tendency hostile to that of majority, and cannot succeed in impressing a dangerous style on the government.

The bad administration of one magistrate under democracy is an isolated fact that has influence only for the short duration of that administration. 

A corrupt or incapable magistrate will not combine his efforts with another magistrate for the sole reason that the latter is incapable and corrupt like him, and they will never work in concert to make corruption and incapacity flourish in their prosperity.

*On public spirit in the United States*

There is at the base of democratic institutions a hidden tendency that make men cooperate. There exists a love of native country that has its source principally in the unreflective, disinterested sentiment that binds the heart of the man to the place where the man was born.

This instinctive love intermingles with the taste for old customs. It is a sort of religion itself. This love of country pushes one to great, fleeting efforts rather than to the continuity of efforts.

The most powerful means of interesting men in the fate of their native country is to make them participate in its government. The spirit of the city seems inseparable from the exercise of political rights. A moment arrives in the lives of people when old customs are changed, mores destroyed and people don't perceive the native country as strong.

*On the idea of rights in the United States*

The idea of rights is nothing other than the idea of virtue introduced into the political world. It is with the idea of rights that men have defined what license and tyranny are.

One cannot say it too often: there is nothing more prolific in marvels than the art of being free; there is nothing harder than the apprenticeship of freedom. Despotism presents itself as the mender of all ills suffered. It is the support of good law. Freedom is born in the midst of storms, established in civil discord.

*On respect for the law in the United States*

In the US, there is no one who is not an elector. Those who want to attack the laws are reduced to do two things: change the opinion of the nation or ride roughshod over its will. In the US, people obey the laws as those "does not make up a part of the majority today will perhaps be in its ranks tomorrow; and the respect that he professes now for the will of the legislator he will soon have occasion to require for his."

If the laws of democracy are not always respectable, they are always respected - those who generally violate the laws cannot fail to obey those that they have. Furthermore, the people in America obey the law not only because it is their work but also because they can change it when by chance it hurts them.

*Activity reigning in all parts of the body politic of the united states; influence that it exerts on society*

When one passes from a free country into another that is not, one is struck by a very extraordinary spectacle: there, all is activity and movement.

If this remark is applicable to free countries that have preserved the monarchical form and to where aristocracy dominates, it is still more so in democratic republic. It is no longer one portion of the people that undertakes to better the state of society; the entire people takes charge of this care. It is not only a question of providing for the needs and the conveniences of one class, but of all classes at the same time.

Political activity is tumultuous. When the enemies of democracy claim that one alone does better what he takes charge of than the government of all, it seems to me that they are right. The government of one alone puts more coherence into its undertakings than the multitude; it shows more perseverance.

This agitation that the government of democracy has introduced into the political world passes afterwards into civil society.  Every day people indicate to him new improvements to make to the common property; and he feels the desire being born to improve what is personal to him.

Democracy ... creates a restive activity through the whole social body, a superabundant force, an energy that never exists without it and create marvels. 263

### V1, P2, C7: ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF THE MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS EFFECTS 265

It is of the very essence of democratic government that the empire of the majority is absolute; for in democracies, outside the majority there is nothing that resists it.

Of all political powers, the legislature is the one that obeys the majority most willingly. Americans wanted the members of the legislature to be named directly by the people, and for a very short term in order to oblige them to submit not only to the general views.

The moral empire of the majority is also founded on the principle that the interest of the greatest number ought to be preferred to those of the few.

There is a certain social state in which the members of the minority cannot hope to attract the majority to them, because for that it would be necessary to abandon the very object of the struggle that they sustain against it.

The majority in the United States therefore has an immense power in fact, and a power in opinion almost as great; and once it has formed on a question, there are so to speak no obstacles that can, I shall not stop and allow it the time to hear the complaints of those it crushes it passes.

Lots of consequences to be seen.

*How the omnipotence of the majority in America increases the legislative and administrative instability

Legislative instability is an evil inherent in democratic government because it is of the nature of democracies to bring new men to power. But this evil is more or less great according to the power and the means of actions granted to the legislator.

In America they hand over sovereign power to the authority that makes the laws, indulging each of its desires rapidly and irresistibly and every year it is given other representatives.

The omnipotence of the majority and the rapid and absolute manner in which its will is executed in United States not only renders the law unstable, it exerts the same influence on the execution of the law and on the action of public administration.

Omnipotence seems to be an evil and dangerous thing in itself. Its exercise appears to me above the strength of man and I see only God who can be omnipotent without danger.

What I reproach in democratic government, and what is most repugnant to me in America is not the extreme freedom that reigns there, it is the lack of guarantee against tyranny.

*Effects of the omnipotence of the majority on the arbitrariness of American officials*

One must distinguish well arbitrariness from tyranny. Tyranny can be exercised by means of law itself, and then it is not arbitrariness.

Tyranny ordinarily makes use of arbitrariness.

In the United States, it favours the arbitrariness of the magistrate. The majority, being an absolute master in making the law and in overseeing its execution, having equal control over those who govern and over those who are governed, regards public officials as its passive agents and willingly deposits in them the care of serving its designs. It treats them as a master could do to his servants.

The law leaves American officials much freer than ours within the circle that it draws around them. It sometimes even happens that the majority permits them to leave it.

*On the power that the majority in American exercises over thought*

When one comes to examine what the exercise of thought is in the United States, then one perceives very clearly to what point the majority surpasses all the powers that we know in Europe.

Thought is an invisible power that makes sport of all tyrannies. in our day the most absolute sovereigns of Europe cannot prevent certain thoughts hostile to their authority from mutely circulating in their states and even in the heart of their courts.

In America, the majority draws a formidable circle around thought. Inside those limits, the writer is free: but unhappiness awaits him if he dares to leave them. He is the butt of mortification of all kinds and of persecutions every day.

Princes had so to speak made violence material: democratic republics in our day have rendered it just as intellectual as the human will that it wants to constrain. The master no longer says to it: you shall think as I do or you shall die, you are free not to think as I do; your life, your goods, everything remains to you; but from this day on, you are a stranger among us. You shall keep your privileges in the city, but they will become useless to you; for if you crave the vote of your fellow citizens, they will not grant it to you, and if you demand only their esteem, they will still pretend to refuse it to you. You shall remain among men, but you shall lose your rights of humanity.

*Effects of the tyranny of the majority on the national character of the Americans; on the spirit of a court in the United States*

The influence of the preceding still makes itself felt only feebly in political society; but one already remarks its distressing effects on the national character of the Americans.

Democratic republics put the spirit of a court within reach of the many and let it penetrate all classes at once. That is one of the principal reproaches that can be made against them.

Among the immense crowd that flocks to a political career in the United States, I have seen few men indeed who show that virile candour, that manly independence of thought, that often distinguished Americans in previous times and forms the salient feature of great characters.

I believe that in all government, whatever they may be, baseness will attach itself to force and flattery to power. And I know only one means of preventing men - it is to grant to no one, along with omnipotence, the sovereign power to demean them.

*That the great danger of the American republics comes from the omnipotence of the majority*

Governments ordinarily perish by powerlessness or by tyranny, in the first case power escape them; in the other, it is torn from them.

It is almost always the abuse of its strength and the bad use of its resources bring to perish. Anarchy is almost always born of its tyranny or its lack of skilfulness, but not of its powerlessness.

In democratic republics, the power that directs society is not stable, for it often changes hands and purpose. But everywhere it is brought, its force is almost. If ever freedom is lost in America, one will have to blame the omnipotence of the majority that will have brought minorities to despair and have forced them to make an appeal to material force. One will then see anarchy, it will have come as a consequence of despotism.

### V1, P2, C8: ON WHAT TEMPERS THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES 277

If the power that direct American societies found these two means of government at its disposal, and added the capacity and the habit of executing everything by itself to the right of commanding everything; if, after having established the general principles of government, it entered into the details of application, and after having regulated the great interests of the country it could descend to the limit of individual interests.

Lawyers in the United States form a power that is hardly feared, scarcely perceived, that has no banner of its own, that bows with flexibility but it envelops society as a whole, penetrates into each of the classes that compose it, works in secret, acts constantly on it without its knowing and in the end models to its desires.

There is almost no political question in the US that is not resolved sooner or later into a judicial question. Lawyers are obliged to yield to the current of public opinion that carries them along; but it is easy to find some indications of what they would do if it was free. In the matter of civil law, the majority is always obliged to rely on lawyers; and American lawyers do not innovate.

*On the jury in US considered as a political institution*

One must distinguish two things in the jury: a judicial institution and a political institution. The institution of the jury had its birth a society barely advanced, in which one scarcely submitted any but simple questions of fact to the courts; and it is not an easy task to adapt it to the need of a very civilized people, when the relations of men among themselves have singularity multiplied and have taken on a learned and intellectual character.

All sovereigns who have wanted to draw the sources of their power from themselves, and to direct society instead of allowing themselves to be directed by it, all sovereignty who have wanted to draw the sources of their power from themselves, and to direct society instead of allowing themselves to be directed by it, have destroyed the institutions of the jury or have enervated it.

...

I understand by a jury a certain number of citizens taken at random and temporarily vested with the right to judge.

Civil cases: the judge appears as a disinterested arbiter.

The juror pronounce the ruling that the judge has rendered. To this ruling, they lend the authority of the society that they represent, and he, that of reason and of law.

The jury, which seems to diminish the rights of the magistracy, therefore really founds its empire, and there is no country where judges are as powerful as those where the people comes into a share of their privileges.

His influence extends well beyond the precincts of the courts; in the relaxations of private life as in the work of political life, in the public square as in the heart of legislatures, the American judge constantly finds men around him who are habituated to seeing in his intelligence something superior to theirs; and after being exercised in trials, his power makes itself felt on all habits of mind and even on the very souls of those who have taken part with him in judging him.

Thus the jury, which is the most energetic means of making the people reign, is also the most efficacious means of teaching them to resign.

### V1, P2, C9: ON THE PRINCIPLE CAUSES TENDING TO MAINTAIN A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES 289

A democratic republic subsists in the United States. The principal goal of this book has been to make the causes of this phenomenon understood.

I thought therefore, that before going further and speaking of the future, I ought to gather in a narrow frame all the reasons that explain the present.

I have thought that all the causes tending to the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States can be reduced to three:
1. The particular and accidental situation in which Providence has placed the Americans form the first
2. The second comes from the laws
3. The third flows from habit and mores

*On the accidental or providential causes contributing to the maintenance of a democratic republic in the US*

There are a thousand circumstances independent of men's will that facilitate the democratic republic in the United States.

The Americans have no neighbours and thus no wars, financial crisis, ravages or conquest.

America does not have a great capital whose direct or indirect influence makes itself felt over the whole extent of its territory.

To submit the provinces to the capital is therefore to put the destiny of the whole empire not only in the hands of a portion of the people which is unjust but also in the hands of the people acting by itself, which is very dangerous.

Among the fortunate circumstances that also favoured the establishment and assured the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States, the first in importance is the choice itself of the country that the Americans inhabits.

General well-being favours the stability of all governments, but particularly of democratic government, which rests on the disposition of the greatest number, and principally on the disposition of those who the most exposed to needs.

In the United States, it is not only legislation that is democratic; nature itself works for the people.

Thirteen million civilized Europeans are quietly spreading into the fertile wilderness whose resources and extent they themselves still do not know exactly. Three or four thousand soldiers push the wandering race of natives before them; behind the armed men advance woodcutters...

Often in the course of this work I have alluded to the material well-being that the Americans enjoy - the success of their laws. This reason had already been given by a thousand others before me: falling in a way before the senses of Europeans, it is the only one that has become popular among us.

Legislation in the United States favours the division of property as possible; but a cause more powerful than legislation prevents property from being divided beyond due measure. They perceive it well in the states that are finally beginning to be filled.

In Europe we habitually regard restless of mind, immoderate desire for wealth, extreme love of independence as great social dangers. It is those things that guarantee a long and peaceful future to the Americans republics.

This exerts a great influence on the manner in which human actions are judged in the two hemisphere.

In our time, America delivers to men a fund of capital always vaster than industry can put to work. Here, America cannot give out enough enlightenment - it turns to the profit of those who do not have it. New needs are not to be feared there since all needs are satisfied without trouble: one must not afraid of giving rise to too many passions, since all passions find an easy and salutary nourishment, one cannot make men too free there, because they are almost never tempted to make a bad use of freedom.

One must go to America to understand what power material well-being exerts on political actions and even on opinions themselves, which ought to be subject only to reason.

The influence of well-being is exerted still more freely on Americans than on foreigners. The American has always seen before his eyes order and public prosperity linked to one another and marching in the same step.

*On the influence of the laws on the maintenance of a democratic republic in the US*
Three things concur to maintain a democratic republic in the New World: the first is the federal form that the Americans have adopted which permits the Union to enjoy the power of a great republic and the security of a small one. Second, moderating the despotism of the majority and giving the people the taste for the freedom and the art of being free. Third, the constitution of judicial power, showing how the courts serve to correct the aberrations of democracy, succeed in slowing and directing them.

I said above that I consider mores to be one of the great general causes to which the maintenance to a democratic republic in the US can be attributed.

I comprehend this word (moeurs) the whole moral and intellectual state of a people.

*On religion considered as a political institution; how it serves powerfully the maintenance of a democratic republic among the Americans*

Next to religion is a political opinion that is joined to it by affinity

*this section is skimmed*

Religion never mixes in the government of society, but it singularly facilitates their use of it - they believe it necessary for the maintenance of republican institutions.

All is well in America except precisely the religious spirit that I admire; and I learn the other side of the ocean the freedom and happiness of the human species lack nothing except to believe with Spinoza in the eternity of the world ... when these attack religious beliefs, they follow their passions and not their interests. Despotism can do without faith, but freedom cannot. Religion is much more necessary in the republic they extol in the monarchy they attack.

*On the principal causes that make religion powerful in America*

In America, religion is reduced to its own strength - it acts in one sphere only but it covers the whole of it and dominates it without efforts.

Two great dangers menace the existence of religions: schisms and indifference
Sometimes people shift from one religion to another.
Sometimes, religious belief is undermined by doctrines that are negative.

Beliefs are abandoned in coldness - he continues to believe does not fear exposing his faith to all eyes. In those who do not share his hopes he sees unfortunates rather than adversaries.

With those who do not believe hiding their disbelief and those who believe showing their faith, a public opinion in favour of religion is produced; people love it, sustain it, honour it.

I perceive men among us who have ceased to believe in Christianity without attaching themselves to any religion.

*How the enlightenment, the habits, and the practical experience of the Americas contribute to the success of democratic institutions*

The American mind turns away from general ideas; it does not direct itself toward theoretical discoveries. Politics itself and industry cannot bring it to them. In the US, new laws are constantly made; but great writers have still not been found to inquire into the general principles of the laws.

If we look at the learned, we will be astonished by their small numbers, if we count the ignorant, the American people will seem to him the most enlightened people on earth.

Americans carry the habits of public life into private life. Among them the idea of the jury is discovered in school games, and one finds parliamentary forms even in the ordering of a banquet.

*That the laws serve to maintain a democratic republic in the US more than physical causes, and mores more than laws*

One must attribute the maintenance of democratic institutions in the US to circumstances, to laws and to mores.

The American Union has no enemies to combat. It is only Anglo-American democracy that has been able to maintain itself in peace. The territory of the Union presents a boundless field to human activity, allowing nourishment for industry and work. Love of wealth takes the place of ambition.

The legislation of the Americans is well adapted to the genius of the people that it has to rule and to the nature of the country.

There is therefore a reason independent of physical causes and laws that enable democracy to govern the United States. Here is what proves it more - almost all the men who inhabit the territory of the Union have issued from the same blood. They speak the same language, pray to God, are subject to the same causes, obey the same laws.

It is in the East that the Anglo-Americans have practiced the longest use of democratic government and formed habits most favourable to maintaining it - democracy has penetrated little by little into forms.

The West is more barbaric by comparison.

*Would laws and mores suffice to maintain democratic institutions elsewhere than in America*

Does it follow that these same causes transported elsewhere would have the same power?

Outside of America there are no nations that have nevertheless adopted their laws and more.

Americans legislators have come, not without success, to oppose the idea of rights to sentiments of envy, to the continuous movement of the political world, the immobility of religious morality, the experience of the people, to its theoretical ignorance, and its habit of business, to the enthusiasm of its desires.

The Americans have not relied on the nature of the country to combat the dangers that are born of their constitution and their political laws.

...

My goal has been to show that laws and above all mores can permit a democratic people to remain free. We should not follow the example that American democracy has given and to imitate the means, and we are aware of the influence exerted by the nature of the country.

But I think that if one does not come little by little to found democratic institutions among us, that if one renounces giving to all citizens ideas and sentiments that first prepare them for freedom and permit them the use of it... the unlimited power of one alone.

### V1, P2, C10: SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON THE PRESENT STATE AND THE PROBABLE FUTURE OF THE THREE RACES THAT INHABIT THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES 321

Largely skipped.

If one absolutely had to foresee the future ... the abolition of slavery in the South will increase the repugnance for blacks felt by the white population. When whites fear being intermingled with blacks, they are scared of an imaginary danger. In the south, where the danger is real, the fear would be less.

One recognises that in the South, blacks increase more than whites - one concedes that it is impossible to see the period when blacks and whites will come to be mixed and to get the same advantages from society.

Enlightenment is increasing in the South and it has made the inhabitants of that part perceive that slavery is harmful to the master and the near impossibility of destroying it. The South draws consequence from this example. This is a profound perturbation in the laws of humanity.

If one refuses freedom to Negroes in the South, they will seize it violently themselves; if one grants it to them, they will not be slow to abuse it (352)

*What are the chances that the American Union will last? What dangers threaten it?*

... I think that the territory over which the Anglo-American race will one one day spread will equal three-quarters of Europe.

Europe, divided among so many diverse people, has come to have four hundred ten inhabitants per square league.

The bond of religion alone was able to gather the diverse races that propelled Europe into one same civilization,

There are two great people on the Earth: the Russians and the Anglo-Americans. All other people are growing.

The American struggles against the obstacles that nature opposes to him, the Russian with men. Wilderness and barbarism, civilization vested with all its arms.

## V2, P1, C1: ON THE PHILOSOPHIC METHOD OF THE AMERICANS 398

![[Pasted image 20231128192930.png]]

I think there is no country in the civilized world where they are less occupied with philosophy than the United States.

Americans have not needed to draw their philosophic method from books. They have found it in itself.

The Americans, having accepted the principal dogmas of the Christian religion without examination, are obliged to receive in the same manner a great number of moral truths that flow from them and depends on them. That restricts the action of individual analysis within narrow limits and spares from it several of the most important human opinion.

There are no revolutions that do not disrupt ancient beliefs.

When conditions become equal, following a prolonged conflict between the different classes forming the old society ... invading the human heart and make their home there. This independent of equality contribute powerfully to dividing men, to making them distrust the judgement of one another and seek enlightenment in themselves alone.

Each then takes to be self-sufficient. Human opinions form no more than a sort of intellectual dust that is blown around on all sides and cannot gather and settle.

Thus the independence of mind that equality supposes is never so great, or excessive.

## V2, P1, C5: HOW, IN THE UNITED STATES, RELIGION KNOWS HOW TO MAKE USE OF DEMOCRATIC INSTINCTS 412

Men cannot do without dogmatic beliefs and it is wished that they have them. Among all dogmatic beliefs the most desirable seem to me to be dogmatic beliefs in the matter of religion.

The first object and one of the principal advantages of religion is to furnish a solution for each of these primordial questions that is clear, precise, intelligible to the crowd and very lasting.

One must recognize that equality suggests to men very dangerous instincts, as will be shown hereafter. It tends to isolate them from one another and to bring each of them to be occupied with himself alone, opening their soul to the love of material enjoyments.

Evident: the more the barriers that separate nations within humanity and citizens within the interior of each people tend to disappear, the more the human mind is directed ... toward the idea of a single omnipotent being, dispensing the same laws to each man equally...

Another truth appear very clear to me: that religions should be less burdened with external practice in democratic times than in all others.

Nothing revolts the human mind more in times of equality than the idea of submitting to forms.

...

As men become more alike and equal, religion should not collide unnecessarily with the generally accepted ideas and permanent interests that reign among the mass: common opinion appears more and more as the first and most irresistible of powers, there is no support outside of it strong enough to permit long resistance to its blows.

All Americans priests know the intellectual empire the majority exercises and respect it - supporting only necessary struggles against it. Thus it is in respecting all the democratic instincts that are not contrary to it and in taking aid from several of them that religion succeeds in struggling to its advantage against the spirit of individual independence that is the most dangerous of all to it.

## V2, P1, C6: ON THE PROGRESS OF CATHOLICISM IN THE UNITED STATES 419

One must distinguish two things well: equality disposes men to want to judge for themselves, on the other hand, it gives them the taste for and idea of a single social power that is simple and the same for all. Democratic men want things to be uniform and they are ready to perceive that there is no religion.

When they have a religion they immediately encounter a hidden instinct in themselves that pushes them to Catholicism.

It is the most familiar weakness of the human intellect to want to reconcile contrary principles and to buy peace at the expense of logic. There will be men who want to spare several others and let their mind float at random between obedience and freedom.

## V2, P2, C7: WHAT MAKES THE MIND OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE LEAN TOWARD PANTHEISM 420

Democracy's effects on philosophy.

As conditions become more equal and each man in particular becomes more like all the others, weaker and smaller, one gets used to no longer viewing citizens, thinking only of the citizen.

Here, the human mind loves to embrace a host of diverse objects at once.

The idea of unity obsesses over the mind - it wraps in its bosom. It naturally attracts their imagination and fixes it; it nourishes the haughtiness and flatters the laziness of their minds.

Pantheism is the most appropriate to seduce the human mind - all who remained enamoured of the genuine greatness of man should unite and do combat against it.

## V2, P1, C8: HOW EQUALITY SUGGESTS TO THE AMERICAS THE IDEA OF THE INDEFINITE PERFECTIBILITY OF MAN 421

Equality suggests several ideas to the human mind.

One feature is peculiar to man and not animal: he perfects himself and they do not perfect himself.

When citizens are classed according to rank, profession or birth and all are constrained, each believes that he perceives the furthest boundaries of human power near himself ... none seeks any longer to struggle against an inevitable destiny. They conceive of improvement, not change, the condition of coming societies as better.

They do not believe that they have arrived at absolute truth, but that they attained nearly the degree that our imperfect nature permits.

As castes disappear, as classes get closer to each other, as men are mixed tumultuously and their usages as new truths are brought to light.

Continual changes then pass at each instant before the eyes of each man. Some worsen his position and he understands only too well that an individual is not infallible.

I meet an American sailor - why his vessels are built to last a short time. The art of navigation makes rapid progress daily that the most beautiful ship will become useless if its existence was prolonged.

## V2, P2, C9: HOW THE EXAMPLE OF THE AMERICANS DOES NOT PROVE THAT A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE CAN HAVE NO APTITUDE AND TASTE FOR THE SCIENCES, LITERATURE, AND THE ARTS 423

One must recognize that there are few in whom the advanced sciences have made less progress than in the United States.

Several ideas:
The situation of the Americans is therefore entirely exceptional and it is to be believed that no other democratic people will be placed in it. 

![[Pasted image 20231129011235.png]]

One can conceive of a people where there would be neither castes, hierarchy or classes and deprived of enlightenment and freedom. A despot might find that his interest lies in making his subjects equal and leaving them ignorant in order to keep them more easily as slaves. Estate laws would destroy fortunes and not create new ones - a complete equality.

When I come to imagine a democratic society of this kind ... a low, dark, stifling place where enlightenment, brought from outside, soon fades and is extinguished.

When men who live in the heart of a democratic society are enlightened, they discover without difficulty that nothing limits or fixes them and forces them to content themselves with their present fortune.

There is another simpler and less dangerous remedy: to grant privilege to no one, to give equal enlightenment and an equal independence for all, to leave to each the care of marking out his own place. Natural inequality will see the light of day.

In democratic, enlightened and free centuries, men have nothing separating them or keeping them in their place - they rise or fall with singular rapidity. All classes see each other constantly because they are close. From the moment when the crowd begins to be interested in works of the mind, we discover a great means of acquiring glory, power or wealth is to excel in some of them.

## V2, P1, C13: THE LITERARY FACE OF DEMOCRATIC CENTURIES 440

America is a civilized country where people are least occupied with literature.

They find the literature of England on their own soul.

Citizens of the US themselves seem so convinced that books are not published for them, that before settling on merit of their writers, they wait for them to be sampled in England.

Let us transport ourselves to the heart of a democracy whose old traditions and present enlightenment render it responsive to enjoyments of the mind. Ranks are mixed and confused.

This confused crowd needs intellectual needs to be satisfied - these new lovers of the pleasures of the mind have not all received the same education, not the same enlightenment, differ. In this heart of incoherent and agitated multitude authors are born.

Taken in its entirety, literature in democratic centuries cannot present the image of order, of regularity, of science and of art as in aristocratic times. Form will ordinarily be found neglected and sometimes scorned. Without doubt writers will be encountered who will be read in spite of defects - exceptions will be rare.

In democracies, it is far from the case that all men who are occupied with literature have an education. They want books that are not troubling, easy to read, do not require learned research. What more do I need to say about this?

Two extreme states: nations do not go all at once from the first to the second, they arrive at it gradually. 

# Volume 2, part 2

## V2, P2, C1: WHY DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES SHOW A MORE ARDENT AND MORE LASTING LOVE FOR EQUALITY THAN FOR FREEDOM 473

The first and most lively of the passions to which equality of conditions give birth is the love of this equality

Although men cannot become absolutely equal without being entirely free, and consequently equality in its most extreme degree becomes confused with freedom, yet there is a foundation for distinguishing one from the other.

Equality furnishes a multitude of little enjoyments daily to each man. They move to delirium.

The goods that freedom brings show themselves only in the long term, and it is always easy to fail to recognize the cause that gives birth to them. The advantages of equality make themselves felt from now on.

Political freedom in its excesses is able to compromise the tranquillity - only attentive people perceive the perils. The evils that extreme equality can produce become manifest only little by little.

Democratic people love equality but they press the passion they feel for it to delirium -  old social hierarchy is finally destroyed. Men rush at equality and becomes attached to it as a precious good someone wants to rob them of.

They have a natural taste for freedom, they have an eternal passion for equality and if they cannot get it they will want it in slavery. They will tolerate poverty, enslavement, barbarism but not aristocracy.

## V2, P2, C5:  ON THE USE THAT THE AMERICANS MAKE OF ASSOCIATION IN CIVIL LIFE 484

The political associations that exist in the US form only a detail in the midst of the immense picture that exist.

All minds unite - religion, moral, grave, futile and more.

In democracies, all citizens are independent and weak, and they can do nothing by themselves and none of them can oblige those like themselves to lend them their cooperation. They fall into impotence.

If men who live in democratic countries have neither the right nor the taste to unite, their independence would run great risks.

Sentiments are non-existent in a democratic country.

In democratic peoples, associations must take the place of the powerful particular persons whom equality of conditions has made disappear.

In democratic countries the science of association is the mother science; the progress of all the others depend on the progress of that one.

## V2, P2, C6: ON THE RELATION BETWEEN ASSOCIATIONS AND NEWSPAPERS 488

When men are no longer bound in a solid and permanent manner, one cannot get many to act in common except by persuading each of them that cooperation is necessary that his interest obliges him voluntarily to unite his efforts.

A newspaper is a counsellor that speaks to you of common affairs. As individualism is feared and men become more equal, they maintain civilizations.

It furnishes the means of executing in common the designs they had already conceived.

it happens in democratic countries that men who have the need to associate cannot do it - they do not see each other and do not know where to find each other.

The newspaper has brought them nearer and it continues to them to keep them together.

There exists a necessary relation between associations and newspapers: newspapers make associations and associations make newspapers; and if it was true to say that associations must be multiplied as conditions are equalized.

A newspaper can only exist on condition that it reproduces a doctrine or sentiment common to many men. That association can be defined.

The more conditions become equal, and the less men are individually strong, the more they easily let themselves go with the current of the crowd and have trouble holding an opinion that it has abandoned.

It represents the association; one can say that it speaks to each of its readers in the name of all others, carrying them the more easily as individuals are weaker.

The empire of newspapers should grow as men become equal.

## V2, P2, C7: RELATIONS BETWEEN CIVIL ASSOCIATIONS AND POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS 491

There is only one nation on Earth where the unlimited freedom to associate for political views.

Among all the peoples where political association is prohibited, civil association is rare.

Politics not only gives birth to many associations, it creates vast associations. In civil life, it is rare that the same interest naturally attracts many men toward a common action. In politics, the occasion offers itself at every moment.

One can be engaged in most civil associations by risking a portion of one's patrimony. They would rather be deprived of a powerful means of success than risk the dangers that accompany it. But they hesitate less  to take part in political associations because in them they do not risk their money. They learn in these associations to submit their will to that of others. Political associations can be considered great schools.

When they are allowed to associate freely, they see in association the universal and so to speak the unique means of which men can make use of the different ends.

It is therefore while enjoying a dangerous freedom that Americans learn the art of rendering the perils of freedom less great. Political associations can trouble the state and paralyze industry, but it is easy to demonstrate that freedom of association helps well-being.
## V2, P2, C8: HOW THE AMERICANS COMBAT INDIVIDUALISM BY THE DOCTRINE OF SELF-INTEREST WELL UNDERSTOOD 495

Each American knows how to sacrifice a part of his particular interests to save the rest. We want to keep everything and often everything eludes us.

There is no power that can prevent the equality of conditions from bringing the human spirit toward searching for the useful and from disposing each citizen to shrink within itself.

ChatGPT says: in the past, powerful individuals want less self-interest. Now, we become more individualistic.

In pursuing their own well-being, Americans contribute to the common good.

Americans explain their actions by highlighting how enlightened self-love can help sacrifice one another for the state. Self-interest turns personal interest against itself, promotes habits of regulation. It prevents gross depravity.

We are concerned about the growing influence of individual interest as a motive for equality. We don't want unchecked self-interest.

## V2, P2, C9: HOW THE AMERICANS APPLY THE DOCTRINE OF SELF-INTEREST WELL UNDERSTOOD IN THE MATTER OF RELIGION 498

There are a great number of sacrifices that one can find their recompense only in the other world. Can the doctrine of self-interest be understood in religion?

To attain happiness, a man resists instinct and combats them. If he has faith in religion, it won't cost him to submit himself to the hindrances that it imposes.

If we sacrifice pleasure for long-term goods, we can embrace religious teachings.

They practice their religion with methodical, calculation, placing in this world the interest one can have in following it. These religious beliefs favour freedom and public order.

## V2, P2, C13: WHY THE AMERICANS SHOW THEMSELVES SO RESTIVE IN THE MIDST OF THEIR WELL-BEING

In America, the author observes a paradox: the freest and most enlightened individuals appear grave and almost sad even in their pleasures. The principal reason for this, according to the author, is that Americans are driven by an insatiable pursuit of well-being. They are in constant haste to acquire and enjoy material goods, displaying a feverish ardor that leads to a perpetual state of restlessness.

The author attributes this restlessness to the relentless pursuit of material enjoyment, exacerbated by the equality prevalent in democratic societies. In such societies, individuals are individually weak despite the illusion of an open and easy path to success. The struggle for equality, combined with the innate inequalities in intellect, creates a tormenting and fatiguing experience for the people.

The desire for equality becomes insatiable as people, even in the pursuit of vast hopes and ambitions, find themselves individually weak and surrounded by immense obstacles. The author notes that the constant opposition between the instincts arising from equality and the means available to satisfy them contributes to the tormenting and fatiguing experience.

The passage concludes by connecting this restlessness to a peculiar melancholy observed in democratic lands, where individuals often display dissatisfaction amid abundance, and even in tranquil existence, they may experience a sense of disgust with life. The author suggests that these feelings are symptomatic of the malaise caused by unattainable desires and perpetual striving for an elusive and idealized form of equality.


The principal reason for this is that the first do not think of the evils they endure.

It is a strange thing to see with what feverish ardour Americans pursue well-being.

The inhabitants of the US attaches himself to the goods of this world as if he were assured of not dying.

This taste for material enjoyments is one source of secret restiveness revealed in the actions of Americans.

In democratic peoples, men can obtain a certain equality ... not the equality they desire. They believe they are going to seize it and die before having done so ... leaving them melancholic. Religion forbids Americans from killing themselves.

## V2, P3, C21: WHY GREAT REVOLUTIONS WILL BECOME RARE 599

The passage discusses the stability of democratic societies and the factors that make them resistant to revolutions. The author argues that equality in democratic societies, while appearing to make people volatile and ready for change, also instills in them a desire for stability to satisfy their interests and tastes. The majority of citizens, described as neither rich nor poor, are wary of revolutions because they possess enough to desire order but not enough to incite envy. The author notes that the pursuit of well-being and individual interests diverts people from revolutionary passions. Additionally, the prevalence of property ownership in democratic nations makes people reluctant to support revolutions that might threaten acquired property. The author acknowledges that while revolutions can serve industry and commerce in the long run, they often pose initial threats to stability.


Just as there are no longer races of the poor, there are no longer races of the rich. These latter are naturally enemies of violent movements; their immobility keeps in repose all who are above and below them.

Not only do men of democracies not naturally desire revolutions, but they fear them. No religion does not fear private property.

Furthermore, the passage highlights the role of commercial and industrial pursuits in democratic societies, emphasizing that commerce, by its nature, opposes violent passions and favours compromise. The author argues that the pursuit of individual well-being and the attachment to property make people in democratic societies less inclined toward revolutionary movements. The passage also explores the difficulty of inspiring enthusiasm for abstract ideas that do not directly relate to the daily lives of democratic citizens. The author contends that the intellectual anarchy observed in democratic societies is a transient phase during their youth, and as conditions become more alike, common opinions emerge, contributing to intellectual stability.

Moreover, the passage touches on the challenges of changing public opinion in democratic societies. It asserts that individual influences are weak, and the power of the majority over the individual's mind is significant. The difficulty of changing beliefs is attributed to the general opinion's weight on the individual's mind. The passage suggests that, despite the appearance of constant change and motion in democratic societies, true intellectual revolutions are rare, and stability in beliefs is favoured.

It gives them a high idea of their individual worth, brings them to want to handle their own affairs and succeed at them - disposes them from freedom. Commerce is naturally the enemy of all violent passions.

None is fully satisfied with his present fortune, it diverts them from wishing for them as men attach their whole soul to the pursuit of well being.

To his impetuosity they secretly oppose their inertia. After they get away from him, they fall back.

A man comes to conceive in a single stroke a system of ideas very far removed ... when conditions are almost alike, one man does not easily allow himself to be persuaded by another. 

As men resemble each other more, the dogma of the equality of the intellect insinuates itself little by little into their belief, becoming harder for an innovator to acquire and exercise great power over the mind of a people.

In conclusion, the author presents a nuanced perspective on democratic societies, highlighting their stability and resistance to revolutions, while also expressing concerns about potential stagnation and a reluctance to embrace new ideas in the pursuit of individual interests and comfort.

If citizens continue to confine themselves in a circle of small domestic interest, there to become agitated without rest, they will become inaccessible to those great and powerful public emotions that trouble peoples, but develop and renew them. 

I am afraid that they will be too unchangeably fixed in the same institutions, the same prejudices, the same mores, so that the human race will limit itself.

## V2, P3, C22: WHY DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES NATURALLY DESIRE PEACE AND DEMOCRATIC ARMIES NATURALLY DESIRE WAR 609

The author argues that in democratic societies, the same factors that deter people from revolutions also keep them away from war. The military and revolutionary spirits decline simultaneously due to shared causes. Factors such as the increasing number of property owners favouring peace, the rapid consumption of movable wealth by war, the softening of mores and increased compassion inspired by equality, and a reduced sensitivity to the emotional aspects of warfare contribute to the diminishing military spirit in democratic nations.

The author emphasizes that despite the inclination towards peace, democratic nations must maintain armies. However, the author raises concerns about the natural instincts of those in democratic armies. Unlike aristocratic armies where officers and soldiers have distinct roles, democratic armies allow soldiers to become officers, leading to an extensive desire for advancement. The author highlights the inherent difficulties democratic armies face in providing rapid advancement opportunities due to a limited number of ranks and numerous competitors.

In democratic armies, the desire for advancement becomes universal, and the author notes that soldiers often wish for war to create opportunities for promotion. Paradoxically, the armies that desire war most ardently are in nations that cherish peace. This dual effect of equality creates a challenging situation, where the majority of citizens favor peace, while the army, composed of individuals seeking advancement, desires war.

The author expresses concerns about the restiveness within democratic armies, suggesting that soldiers, feeling in an inferior position, may become dissatisfied. Additionally, the democratic army, often led by proletarians, may pose a greater risk of internal turmoil compared to the peace-loving citizenry.

To address these issues, the author explores the idea of using war as a means to redirect the ambition of the army. However, the author argues that while war may temporarily satisfy the army, it does not diminish the inherent peril. Moreover, the author warns that war poses risks to freedom in democratic nations, as it centralizes power and control, potentially leading to despotism.

The author concludes by cautioning against increasing the size of the army as a solution, asserting that in a democratic society, the number of ambitious individuals increases with the army's size. Instead, the author suggests that the remedy lies in cultivating a reflective, intelligent, and stable citizenry that values freedom and order. The discipline and obedience of soldiers, according to the author, ultimately depend on the enlightened and regulated character of the nation.

## V2, P3, C23: WHICH IS THE MOST WARLIKE AND THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY CLASS IN DEMOCRATIC ARMIES 614

In this passage, the author delves into the characteristics of a democratic army, exploring the nature of military service, the roles of soldiers, officers, and noncommissioned officers, and their respective attitudes towards war and peace.

The author notes that democratic armies are typically very numerous relative to the population they serve, and the individuals in democratic societies are not inclined to choose a military career voluntarily. Due to these circumstances, democratic nations often resort to compulsory enlistment, making military service a shared burden among all citizens. The author predicts that this necessity will be universally adopted in democratic societies.

One notable consequence of compulsory military service is that soldiers in democratic armies serve for only a few years, passing through the military briefly. This stands in contrast to aristocratic nations, where military status is often a lifelong commitment. The transient nature of military service in democratic armies has significant implications, as soldiers, brought into service involuntarily, often do not consider themselves seriously engaged in a military career. Instead, they maintain strong connections to their civil lives, preserving the spirit of society within the army.

The author argues that in democratic armies, it is the plain soldiers who most retain their status as citizens, and they are more influenced by national habits and public opinion. This is in contrast to aristocratic armies, where officers, maintaining close ties with civil society, serve as the conservative element.

The passage also introduces the concept of noncommissioned officers, a class that has become more prominent in the present century. The noncommissioned officer is described as having broken ties with civil society and directed desires toward a military career. However, unlike officers, noncommissioned officers have not yet achieved a solid and elevated position, making them more desperate in their ambitions. The author suggests that noncommissioned officers are eager for war and may desire revolutions to advance their positions.

In summary, the passage provides insights into the dynamics of democratic armies, emphasizing the transient nature of soldiers' service, the influence of national habits on plain soldiers, and the ambitious and potentially revolutionary tendencies of noncommissioned officers. The author suggests that understanding these dynamics is crucial for managing the challenges associated with the military in democratic societies.

## V2, P3, C24: WHAT MAKES DEMOCRATIC ARMIES WEAKER THAN OTHER ARMIES WHEN ENTERING INTO A CAMPAIGN AND MORE FORMIDABLE WHEN WAR IS PROLONGED 617

In this portion of the text, the author discusses the impact of peace and war on democratic armies. Key points include:

1. **Risk of Defeat after Long Peace:**
    
    - The author asserts that every army entering a campaign after a long period of peace is at risk of being defeated.
    - In democratic armies, military status is not highly honored during peace, and the elite of the nation tends to turn away from a military career.
    - 
2. **Age and Experience in Democratic Armies:**
    
    - After a prolonged peace, democratic armies often have elderly officers. Due to the slow advancement in times of peace, officers, including generals, tend to be older.
    - The lack of young and experienced leaders is considered a great cause of setbacks in democratic armies.
3. **Impact of Peace on Military Morale:**
    
    - In times of peace, military careers in democratic societies may not be highly honored, leading to a lack of enthusiasm and commitment among officers and soldiers.
    - The officers may develop habits and attitudes unsuited for war during extended periods of peace.
4. **Difference with Aristocratic Armies:**
    
    - Aristocratic armies may have young men in various ranks even during peace, as advancement is often based on birthright rather than seniority.
    - The influence of peace on military mores is less in aristocratic armies, where aristocrats lead the military regardless of their comfort in civil life.
5. **Democratic Armies in Prolonged War:**
    
    - The author argues that in a prolonged war, the situation changes. War becomes the primary industry, attracting the elite of the nation to the military career.
    - Ambitious and warlike individuals are drawn to the army, and the competition for military honors becomes intense.
    - Death opens opportunities for ambition, and the desire for rapid success and military greatness aligns with the spirit of a democratic people.
6. **Democratic Spirit in War:**
    
    - The democratic spirit, characterized by a desire for quick gains and a willingness to take risks, can make democracies formidable in war.
    - Despite being initially reluctant to engage in conflict, once at war, democratic nations may produce extraordinary military leaders and soldiers.
7. **Advantages of War for Democratic Armies:**
    
    - The author suggests that war, while harmful initially, secures advantages for democratic armies that other armies lack.
    - The democratic spirit, desire for rapid success, and willingness to risk lives for victory become assets in the long term.
8. **Risk to Aristocratic Armies:**
    
    - An aristocratic people in conflict with a democratic nation, if unable to defeat the democracy early on, takes the risk of being defeated in the long term due to the advantages war provides to the democratic army.

## V2, P3, C25: WHAT MAKES DEMOCRATIC ARMIES WEAKER THAN OTHER ARMIES WHEN ENTERING INTO A CAMPAIGN AND MORE FORMIDABLE WHEN WAR IS PROLONGED 621

1. **Two Kinds of Discipline:**
    
    - The author distinguishes between two kinds of discipline: one prevalent in aristocratic armies where officers are nobles and soldiers are serfs, and another in democratic armies where there is a greater equality.
2. **Discipline in Aristocratic Armies:**
    
    - In aristocratic armies, where there is a significant social hierarchy and the soldier's obedience is almost like a perfecting of social servitude, discipline is strict and easily established.
    - Soldiers in aristocratic armies may act without thinking, follow orders without question, and display unwavering obedience. This kind of discipline is described as creating formidable "animals trained for war."
3. **Discipline in Democratic Armies:**
    
    - The author argues that attempting to impose the same kind of discipline in democratic armies is futile and could lead to the loss of natural advantages.
    - In democratic armies, discipline should not negate the free will of soldiers but rather aspire to direct it. Obedience is less exact but more impetuous and intelligent. It is rooted in the will of the one who obeys, supported by reason.
    - While the discipline in democratic armies may be less strict, it becomes steadier in the face of danger. Soldiers understand that obedience is necessary to achieve victory.
4. **Comparison with Ancient Armies:**
    
    - The author draws a parallel with ancient armies, stating that only free men and citizens, who were accustomed to treating each other as equals, were accepted in these armies.
    - The armies of antiquity, although originating in aristocracy, exhibited a sort of familiar fraternity between officers and soldiers. Soldiers spoke freely to their generals, and a sense of companionship existed.
5. **Democratic Discipline in War:**
    
    - In a democratic army, discipline is described as being steadied before the enemy. Soldiers recognize the need for silence and obedience to secure victory.
    - The author asserts that armies achieving the most considerable feats in war have known the kind of discipline prevalent in democratic armies.
6. **Reference to Ancient Sources:**
    
    - A reference is made to Plutarch's "The Lives of the Great Captains," where soldiers spoke freely to generals, and there was a sense of companionship between officers and soldiers in ancient armies.
7. **Outcome of Ancient Armies:**
    
    - Despite the potential lack of perfection in the little details of military discipline in ancient Greek and Roman armies, historical figures like Alexander the Great and the Roman Empire achieved significant military conquests.

## V2, P3, C26: SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON WAR IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES

In this passage, the author discusses the impact of the principle of equality on the occurrence and nature of wars in democratic societies. The author observes that as equality develops across nations, people become more similar in their aversion to war and preference for peace. The interconnected interests of democratic nations make it difficult for them to engage in isolated conflicts, reducing the occurrence of wars. However, when wars do happen, they tend to have a larger scope.

The author notes that in democratic societies, the numerical strength of armies becomes crucial for victory, leading nations to mobilize a large portion of their population for war. As equality prevails, the social power of democratic nations strengthens, allowing them to unite their forces effectively. The author contrasts this with aristocratic societies, where warfare is more challenging due to internal resistance.

Moreover, the author argues that the similarity among democratic nations extends beyond a few aspects to most facets of their societies. This similarity has significant consequences for warfare. The author contends that, in democratic societies, citizens are generally less willing to engage in armed conflicts, making civil wars less likely. The moral and material power of the majority in democratic societies makes it challenging for minority factions to resist the established government, leading to shorter and less frequent civil wars.

Overall, the author asserts that the principle of equality in democratic societies influences the dynamics of war, making conflicts less frequent but potentially more extensive when they occur.

## V2, P4, C1: EQUALITY NATURALLY GIVES MEN THE TASTE FOR FREE INSTITUTIONS 629

In summary, the text discusses how equality, by making individuals independent in their private lives, inclines them toward a love of political freedom and independence. The author argues that the natural tendency of people in democratic societies is to value self-governance and to resist external authority. While some fear that this inclination might lead to anarchy, the author contends that anarchy is not the primary concern. Instead, he asserts that the more subtle danger lies in another tendency of equality—the gradual movement towards servitude. The author praises equality for instilling the instinct for political independence in individuals, seeing it as a key factor in mitigating the potential negative consequences of its own influence.

Equality makes them contract the habit and taste of following their will alone in their particular actions. Equality produces tendencies: one that can lead them to independence and anarchy, the other towards servitude. People see the first but they don't see the second.

## V2, P4, C2: THAT THE IDEAS OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES IN THE MATTER OF GOVERNMENT ARE NATURALLY FAVOURABLE TO THE CONCENTRATION OF POWERS 630

In summary, the text discusses how the concept of secondary powers, positioned between the sovereign and subjects, is natural in aristocratic societies due to the presence of individuals or families deemed exceptional by birth, enlightenment, and wealth. In contrast, this idea is absent in democratic societies, where the inclination is towards a lone central power governing all citizens. The author highlights the natural emergence of ideas such as uniform legislation and the diminishing importance of individual rights in democratic times. The text concludes by noting the widespread acceptance of these ideas in modern democracies and the evolving beliefs of sovereigns, emphasizing the dominance of the concept of a single, omnipotent governing power in contemporary political thought.

Americans believe that in each state the social power ought to emanate directly from the people, that once power is constituted they image image so to speak no limits to it.

After the idea of a lone central power, the one that manifests is one of uniform legislation. As conditions are equalized, individuals appear smaller and society greater, giving people a humble idea of the rights of the individual realising that the interest of society is everything and the individual nothing.

## V2, P4, C3: THAT THE SENTIMENTS OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE ARE IN ACCORD WITH THEIR IDEAS IN BRINGING THEM TO CONCENTRATE POWER 633

**Needs more quotations**.

The text discusses how equality in democratic societies leads individuals to develop a preference for a strong central power. The author asserts that the habits and sentiments of people in democracies make them naturally inclined to recognize and support a powerful central authority, particularly when they face challenges in managing public affairs themselves. Citizens, often preoccupied with private matters, are prone to entrust the responsibility for collective interests to the state. The love for public tranquility and the fear of anarchy further encourage citizens to grant additional rights to the central power. The text notes that in democratic centuries, as the hatred for privileges increases, political rights tend to concentrate in the hands of the central power. The author concludes that individual independence and local liberties in democratic societies may require intentional efforts to resist the natural drift toward centralization.

Love of public tranquillity is often the sole political passion that these peoples preserve and it becomes more active and powerful as the others are weakened and die.

As in centuries of equality no one is obliged to lend his force to those like him.


## V2, P4, C4: ON SOME PARTICULAR AND ACCIDENTAL CAUSES THAT SERVE TO BRING A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE TO CENTRALIZE POWER OR TURN IT AWAY FROM THAT 636

In this chapter, Alexis de Tocqueville delves into the nuanced dynamics of centralization in democratic societies, shedding light on the unequal tendencies influenced by specific circumstances surrounding the advent of equality. The author distinguishes between societies with a prolonged experience of freedom before the onset of equality and those where equality emerges abruptly. In the former, individuals, despite the increasing privileges of the central power, retain a certain degree of independence. Conversely, in societies where equality swiftly takes root, there is a notable convergence of powers toward the center, resulting in the rapid amplification of state strength while individuals witness a sudden decline in their autonomy.

The historical case of English settlers in America serves as an illustrative example. Having been habituated to freedom in their homeland, these settlers carried with them a tradition of participating in public affairs, knowledge of legal practices like the jury system, and a deep-rooted understanding of individual freedom. This historical context contrasts sharply with Europe, where equality, introduced under absolute power and the watchful eye of monarchs, had permeated societal habits long before the conception of freedom.

Tocqueville emphasizes that in the early stages of significant democratic revolutions, the people tend to centralize public administration as a means of wresting control from the aristocracy. However, as these revolutions progress, it is often the defeated aristocracy that endeavors to hand over the reins of governance to the state, fearing the potential tyranny of an empowered populace.

Furthermore, the author explores the critical role of enlightenment in democratic centuries. While the ease of establishing a single, all-powerful government is facilitated by instinct when all men resemble each other, it takes a considerable amount of intelligence, science, and art to organize and maintain secondary powers. This becomes particularly challenging in the context of the independence and individual weakness of citizens, necessitating the creation of free associations capable of resisting tyranny without jeopardizing order.

Centralization, Tocqueville argues, grows not only in proportion to equality but also due to ignorance. In barely enlightened centuries, the government often lacks the enlightenment required for perfect despotism, but the central power, being the focal point of available knowledge, tends to attract the intellectual capacity necessary for administration.

The author contends that societies with a less aristocratic sovereign demonstrate a greater inclination toward centralization. In democracies where rulers are offspring of democratic principles, born and bred within the ethos of equality, citizens are more likely to willingly extend privileges to the central power, viewing it as a reflection of their own interests.

Moreover, Tocqueville examines the consequences of revolutions, highlighting that a society emerging from a long and tumultuous upheaval is particularly disposed to increasing the prerogatives of the central power. The aftermath of revolutions, characterized by upheaval, hatred, conflicting interests, and factions, fuels a disordered love for order, prompting citizens to sacrifice their rights for perceived tranquility.

In concluding this chapter, the author introduces the principal accidental cause contributing to centralization—the origin and inclinations of the sovereign. Societies in centuries of equality are naturally inclined to love the central power, especially when it faithfully represents their interests and instincts. The attraction of administrative powers toward the center is less restrained when rulers are new princes, products of the democratic order, whose birth, prejudices, instincts, and habits align closely with the cause of equality.

In essence, Tocqueville simplifies the science of despotism in democratic societies, attributing the centralization of public power to a fundamental condition—loving or convincingly pretending to love equality.

This multifaceted exploration provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate forces shaping the trajectory of centralization in democratic societies, underscoring the impact of historical context, revolutions, enlightenment, and the nature of sovereign authority.
## V2, P4, C5: THAT AMONG EUROPEAN NATIONS OF OUR DAY SOVEREIGN POWER INCREASES ALTHOUGH SOVEREIGNS ARE LESS STABLE 650

In this chapter, the author delves into the multifaceted expansion of state power and centralization, offering a comprehensive exploration of its consequences across various societal domains. The overarching theme revolves around the evolving role of the sovereign, or the state, and its intrusion into spheres that were traditionally considered beyond its purview. The narrative unfolds, revealing the state's encroachment into realms such as charity, education, religion, and even the minutiae of private affairs.

A pivotal aspect of the discussion revolves around the state's economic influence. The author underscores the transformation of the state into not just a political authority but a significant economic player. This economic role involves the state accumulating capital through loans and, notably, exerting control over both the financial resources of the wealthy and the savings of the less affluent. The state emerges as a debtor to the wealthy and a manager of the financial resources of the less privileged.

Moreover, the chapter scrutinizes the intersection of state power with industrial development, positing that the progress of equality catalyses industrial growth. As the industrial class burgeons, so does the state's involvement in industrial activities. Rather than merely regulating, the state assumes an active role in executing and managing industrial endeavours, thereby consolidating its influence.

**The narrative extends to concerns about the regulation of associations and the diminishing autonomy of citizens. Despite associations initially being seen as potential avenues for resisting central power, the author observes a paradoxical sentiment among citizens—a simultaneous need for associations and an underlying fear and jealousy that contributes to their regulation by the state.

**The author concludes by elucidating a seemingly contradictory dynamic: two parallel revolutions unfolding simultaneously. The democratic revolution, driven by a quest for equality, leads to the overthrow of entrenched aristocratic powers. However, as equality is progressively realized, the initial spirit of independence gives way to a trend of centralization. This dual evolution results in a more potent social and political authority. The author issues a caution against conflating the pursuit of equality with the revolutionary processes, highlighting the inadvertent strengthening of powers that citizens initially sought to dismantle.**

CHATGPT:
1. **State as the Dominant Force:** The author emphasizes that the state is not only expanding its control over public affairs but is also intervening in private matters. The state, according to the author, is becoming the chief, master, paymaster, and banker of each citizen.
    
2. **Centralization and Regulation:** The theme of centralization is not limited to political power alone; the author contends that public administration has become more centralized and intrusive. The state regulates various aspects of life, imposing its influence on actions, big and small, in an individual's life.
    
3. **Role of Industry:** The development of industry is identified as a significant factor contributing to the expansion of state power. The industrial class, while growing in importance, is subject to increasing regulation and control by the state, leading to a natural alignment between the two.
    
4. **Associations and Independence:** The author explores the idea that associations, while potentially powerful against the central power, are also viewed with suspicion. Sovereigns tend to want control over associations, and citizens, despite needing them, may harbor a certain fear and jealousy towards them.
    
5. **Revolution and Paradox:** The author points out a paradox in the revolutions of the time. While the overthrow of old aristocratic powers was fueled by a spirit of independence, the resulting victory of equality led to a reinforcement and centralization of the social power of the state.
    
6. **Tension Between Freedom and Control:** The passage discusses a tension between the desire for freedom and the reality of increased state control. The revolutions aimed at establishing equality paradoxically contribute to a more potent sovereign, raising concerns about the true nature of the evolving social and political landscape.
    

These points collectively paint a picture of a society undergoing significant transformations, marked by both the pursuit of equality and an evolving relationship between individuals and the state.

## V2, P4, C7: CONSULTATION OF THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS 655

In Chapter 7, the author reflects on the susceptibility of democratic societies to the establishment of absolute and despotic governments, emphasizing the potential loss of fundamental human attributes under such regimes. Despotism is particularly feared in democratic ages. The author expresses a preference for freedom, especially in the current times. The discussion revolves around the challenges of establishing free government in a society with equal conditions.

The author argues that in democratic nations, the power of the sovereign must be more uniform, centralized, and extended, given the natural strength of society and the relative subordination of individuals. While acknowledging that individual independence might not be as extensive as in aristocratic societies, the author asserts the necessity of an active and powerful central power, cautioning against its abuse.

Drawing parallels with aristocratic societies, the author suggests democratic procedures to safeguard individual freedom, such as entrusting administrative powers to temporary bodies formed by citizens. The concept of elective officials is proposed as a democratic alternative to hereditary officials.

The author discusses the importance of the press in democratic nations, highlighting its role in defending individual rights against the potential abuses of power. Freedom of the press is deemed crucial in counteracting the isolating and weakening effects of equality on individuals.

Judicial power is also considered essential for protecting individual independence, especially in democratic times when the sovereign's influence extends into various aspects of life. The author advocates for the courts as a safeguard against the encroachment of power on individual rights.

The chapter emphasizes the significance of forms and procedures in democratic societies, contrasting the disdain for forms with their crucial role in protecting individual rights and slowing down the exercise of power. The author cautions against the democratic tendency to undervalue individual rights and emphasizes the need for constant vigilance to prevent the sacrifice of these rights for perceived societal benefits.

The discussion extends to the dangers of revolutionary instincts in democratic times, with the author highlighting the risk of these instincts transforming into long-lasting governmental mores and administrative habits.

In conclusion, the author calls for a new approach to governance in the age of democracy. Emphasizing the need to set visible and immovable limits for social power, protect individual rights, and maintain a balance between the power of the state and the independence of individuals, the author argues for a focus on making great men rather than merely achieving great things with men. The chapter ends with a recognition of the challenges posed by the evolving political landscape and a call for vigilance and combativeness to ensure the preservation of freedom in democratic societies.

OR

The author begins by expressing the belief that "it is easier to establish an absolute and despotic government in a people where conditions are equal than in any other." The author is particularly concerned about the long-term consequences, asserting that such a government, once established in a society with equality, would not only oppress individuals but "rob each of them of several of the principal attributes of humanity."

The passage underscores the author's view that "Despotism... appears to me particularly to be dreaded in democratic ages." The author declares a personal affinity for freedom, especially in the current era, stating, "I would, I think, have loved freedom in all times; but I feel myself inclined to adore it in the time we are in."

The author dismisses the idea of basing freedom on privilege and aristocracy, arguing that "All those who want to attract authority to a single class and retain it there will fail." Instead, the author advocates for embracing equality: "To be honest and prosperous, it is still enough for democratic nations to wish it."

The passage explores the nature of power in democratic nations, asserting that "the power of the sovereign must be more uniform, more centralized, more extended, more penetrating, and more powerful in them than elsewhere." The author acknowledges the reduction in the circle of individual independence, stating, "One must therefore not expect that the circle of individual independence will ever be as large in democratic lands as in aristocratic countries."

In proposing alternative methods, the author suggests, "Instead of handing over to the sovereign alone all the administrative powers that one takes away from corporations or from the nobles, one can entrust a part of them to secondary bodies formed temporarily of plain citizens."

The author contemplates the role of associations of plain citizens, stating, "I think that when plain citizens associate, they can constitute very opulent, very influential, very strong beings—in a word, aristocratic persons."

The passage underscores the importance of the press in democratic nations, with the author asserting, "I think that men who live in aristocracies can do without freedom of the press if they must; but those who inhabit democratic lands cannot do so."

The author emphasizes the significance of judicial power, stating, "The force of the courts has in all times been the greatest guarantee that can be offered to individual independence, but that is above all true in democratic centuries."

Regarding revolutionary instincts in democratic times, the author warns, "I do not know of any country in which revolutions are more dangerous than in democratic countries, because independent of the accidental and passing evils that they can never fail to do, they always risk creating permanent and so to speak eternal ones."

The passage concludes with a call for vigilance against revolutionary instincts and a focus on new remedies. The author suggests, "To fix extended, but visible and immovable, limits for social power; to give to particular persons certain rights and to guarantee them the uncontested enjoyment of these rights; to preserve for the individual the little independence, force, and originality that remain to him; to elevate him beside society and to sustain him before it: this appears to me to be the first object of the legislator in the age we are entering."

## V2, P4, C8: GENERAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT 662

In this reflective passage, the author grapples with the daunting task of assessing the general impact of equality on society, considering the ongoing revolution that is reshaping the social, legal, and ideological landscape. The author acknowledges the difficulty of this undertaking, noting, "the difficulty of such an undertaking arrests me; confronted with so great an object I feel my sight becoming blurred and my reason wavering."

Despite the ongoing nature of the social transformation, the author observes certain emerging features of the evolving society. There is a shift in the distribution of wealth, with "great wealth disappearing; the number of small fortunes is increasing." Ambition becomes a universal sentiment, yet the grand ambitions of the past are now rare: "ambition is a universal sentiment, there are few vast ambitions."

The author paints a picture of a society where individuals are increasingly isolated and weak, while the state takes on a more significant role: "Each individual is isolated and weak; society is agile, far-seeing, and strong; particular persons do small things and the state does immense ones." This highlights a transformation in the balance of power between individuals and the state.

There is an overall moderation in various aspects of life, as extremes are softened: "Almost all extremes become milder and softer; almost all prominent points are worn down to make a place for something middling that is at once less high and less low." The author reflects on the implications of this uniformity, expressing a somewhat melancholic sentiment: "The spectacle of this universal uniformity saddens and chills me, and I am tempted to regret the society that is no longer."

The passage delves into the author's personal bias in preferring the exceptional and extreme elements of society, acknowledging that this preference arises from individual weakness: "I turned my regard away from the second and attached it only to the first, and these delighted my view; but I understand that this pleasure was born of my weakness."

The author critiques contemporaries who seek to transplant certain elements from the aristocratic past into the emerging democratic world, asserting that the focus should be on adapting to the new goods that equality can offer: "It is no longer a question of retaining the particular advantages that inequality of conditions procures for men, but of securing the new goods that equality can offer them."

The passage concludes with a contemplation of a divine perspective on societal change, suggesting that what may seem like decadence from a human viewpoint is progress in the eyes of a higher power: "Equality is perhaps less elevated; but it is more just, and its justice makes for its greatness and its beauty." The author expresses a mix of fears and hopes, asserting that democratic nations have the agency to shape their destinies: "To be honest and prosperous, it is still enough for democratic nations to wish it."

In summary, the passage navigates the challenges of assessing the impact of equality on society, offering insights into the evolving dynamics between individuals and the state, the moderation of extremes, and the author's personal reflections on societal transformation.
