[[Tocqueville and Democratic society and democratic adaptability]]

## INTRODUCTION *Tocqueville: Democracy and Crisis*

Tocqueville - a young French Aristocrat who wanted to write about the prison system.
He was struck by the chaos of political life - everyone changed their homes, jobs, situations, restless, no sense of purpose.

The advantages of democracy was hidden underneath the surface - democracy is not as bad as it looks. The hidden strengths of democracy also represented its most serious weaknesses - you can't grasp them when you need them, and democracies are caught between an instinct for action and to wait.

### THE RIVAL VIEWS 3

A common complaint: reality did not match up to fine principles and Americans preached the language of dignity but were coarse, vulgar, money-grubbing beneath it.

Tocqueville detested Americans but grew to love them. Faith was the lynchpin of democracy, the system worked because people believed in it - haphazard, uncoordinated, but sustained in their confidence in the future.

```ad-quote
title: Democracy....
"Democracy does not give the most skillfu government to the people, but it does what the most skillful government is powerless to create; it spreads a restive activity through the whole social body, a superabundant force, an energy that never exists without it ... [it] can bring forth marvels."
```

Democracy is not fully transparent but you can be confident that it will work - it has hidden depths. Philosophers argued that democracy was rotten underneath - not to be trusted since nobody knows what's going on, and gave power to desire, having no capacity for wisdom or decisions. In the long run, it would spell disaster. Democracy leads to wars, leads to would-be tyrants, a form of politics that only works in peacetime.

Another argument: democracy's great virtue is its transparency, a system that laid bare its inner workings. But no, Tocqueville does not equate democracy with transparency - democracy is founded on faith.

There will be a strong temptation to close the gap, genuine democracy is hard to live because you have to take on so much.

### DEMOCRACY AND FATE 11

"Fatalism" - inhabitants of a democracy, Tocqueville feared, would drift along with their fate.

It was a scientific fact - the trend towards the "equality of conditions" was unstoppable. Traditional political elites were being swept away by the idea that no being is born to rule over another, meaning nothing can stand in the way of democracy.

It was also tending towards fatalism because this knowledge of their privileged position in the grand scheme of things required taking the long view. In the short view, democracy seemed unstable, unreliable and ineffective. People feel powerless in surrendering their agency to these forces beyond their control.

Fatalism can result in apathy, or recklessness.

A conversation about steamboat on page 13.

Fatalists can be impatient as well as patient, active as well as passive - we must jump through. What was true of this was true for democracy - democratic man can be ardent and resigned.

First book, Tocqueville discusses the 'tyranny of the majority' which makes democracies impatient and vengeful - lynching, race riots, war fever, democracies run wild and get tired.
Second book the "mild despotism of public opinion" that leads democracies to stagnate.

The same cause: the knowledge possessed by the inhabitants of a democracy that theirs is the system with the underlying advantages. Why not make action now? Why not settle for a quiet life since nothing makes a difference?

... (16)

The danger was that no one would address the circumstances of its politics - people focus on the surface activity of political life and no one would address the underlying circumstances of political life.

How do they get unstuck - education. People must be educated to take charge, to take responsibility, to influence their character to rule themselves.

A problem: teaching people the truth about political trends will lead to fatalism. Thus, we need a strong dose of religion to sustain them: personal faith that could undercut the general truths of political science will help. Historians in the age of democracy were liable to be infected with what Tocqueville called "the doctrine of fatality" - they needed a sense that the future lay open and their choices still mattered. Thus, we need to ensure that consequences are still consequences - we need to learn from experience.

A key part of education was the ability to make mistakes - the freedom to experiment and go wrong, letting people to make their mistakes. But there's a flaw: democracies might benefit when individuals take chances and make mistakes but when whole democracies take chances, individuals will suffer.

The boon of America? America is big enough that its political misjudgements aren't that big of a deal. The problem of America? A moral hazard - nothing bad ever really happened, so American democracy never had to confront a genuine crisis.

### DEMOCRACY AND CRISIS 19

Democracy, Tocqueville knew, flourished because they had no massive events. Crises can be good if they woke America to their circumstances but bad if they undermined confidence.

Now easy way out - democracies find it harder than other systems to coordinate their actions, the volatile quality of democratic life makes reaching timely decisions difficult. Aristocracies are better at focusing their resources whereas Democracy simply doesn't have speed (unless the crisis were a long one).

Democracies can experiment, keep on the move, given time they can adapt their way out of any crisis - but this leads to dangerous moments that no one can solve and potentially, democracies may wait for history to rescue them.

Democracies are suited for long wars as then their advantages of adaptability come to the fore - democracies are bad at international relations as they are too jittery, quick to take offence and let things slide. Aristocratic societies are better at knowing when and how to pick a fight.

Democracies have a vitality and an experimental quality that suits them to an extended contest - they keep shuffling their leaders until they find one. They do not get hung up on tradition and reputation. But military wars can lead to problems of not knowing when to start but more importantly when to stop fighting.

Short-term weaknesses in democracy can prove its undoing. Wars can spread fatalism as well as challenge it.

Democracies are also bad at knowing if a real crisis is on them - they are over sensitive and include people who believe danger is around the corner. We panic needlessly.

Tocqueville describes the ritualised hysteria that accompanied this event:
![[Pasted image 20231115193848.png]]

They are in a state of wakefulness and leads to many crises being illusions - elections remain the sham crises of democratic life. The main culprit is the newspaper - excitable, easy to explode into action and so on. they overreact, they underreact, they lack a sense of proportion. It was hard to know then what crisis would make a democracy learn its lesson - if a crisis was so bad no one could doubt it's real, then it may end in disaster. If it did not end in disaster, there's a risk that it would be filed as a false alarm. Even the real crises were hard to learn from since the democracy emerges at an unacceptable cost. Recovering from mistakes may lead to recklessness.

Democracy must take a crisis to wake it out of its stupor.

### A GUIDE TO THE FUTURE 29

A prediction:
1. Democracies are not good at recognizing crises because the noise makes them insensitive
2. Crises need to get bad before democracies can show their strength as when they get bad, there is scope for democracy to make mistakes
3. Democracy may not learn from the experience.

For example, French politics in the revolutions.
He did not leave to see the American civil war two years later, a crisis that was more bloody than everything before.

Another scholar, Bryce - "the fatalism of the multitude": Americans have acquired enough evidence of the strength of their institutions that they take their success for granted, leading to an optimism that underrated the difficulties of politics, growing complacent and confident in the power of democracy to do anything.

The line between success and failure is a fine one. The moments of truth for a democracy are an illusion.

### EPILOGUE: *The Confidence Trap* 293

The history of democracy shows repeated patterns of behaviour: misapprehension, confusion, brinkmanship, experimentation, recovery. Democracies are not good at spotting crises - they ignore the signs of impending trouble. They overreact to the routine hiccups of political life and scandals grip democracies while systematic failings get overlooked.

They lack perspective but they allow democracies to escape from crises because no single mistake is ever conclusive - it is not pretty and can lead to disappointment.

The confusion that produces the crisis is the same confusion that dissolves it over time - it creates a lingering complacency. Democracies survive their mistakes so the mistakes keep coming.

The current crisis fits this pattern. It was created by complacency and skittishness, generating a series of improvised solutions whose frustrations have continued to mount. We have more - a resolution - but this hope that democracy can be rescued leads to a fear that piecemeal solutions are papering over the cracks.

If the pattern repeats itself, hopes and fears will remain unrealized - the reckoning never arrives. It is a frustration of modern democracy that we can't get to dole out punishments with the scale of the crisis.

Defeated dictators can be torn apart, defeated democratic politicians retire in comfort, elections reinforce the quality of democratic life not bringing closure - we never get to decide which ones deserve the ultimate sanction.

How can we be sure that the pattern will keep repeating? We should not assume that democracies will be able to improvise a solution. The history of democracy and crisis is cumulative - the experience of crisis builds up over time, creating a repeated sequence of democratic crises describes a single, overarching narratives.

A success story - richest and most powerful states overcome the many challenges they encountered on the way. The West defeated their enemies and prospered. But it helps blind the democracies to the threats they face - they lead to systematic failure. Democracies must confront their endemic indebt-ness, their growing inequality and their environmental irresponsibility or they will find themselves beyond rescue.

Two ways of thinking: that the present crisis is not so different from previous crises, and that the present crisis is the cumulative result of previous crises which will need a permanent adjustments.

One reason to think it might be a permanent watershed is that it signals the unravelling of an extended political experiment.

This was the age of neoliberalism - open markets, deregulation of finance, regressive taxation. We have an opportunity to rebuild democracy from the ground up to make it more stable. However, neoliberalism has its champions who draw a different moral: the inability of advanced democratic societies to tackle their propensity to overspend.

This is an argument that has lasted for a long time. One big difference between the twenty-first century version and other incarnations is that both sides would be hesitated to call themselves democratic - both sides call themselves democrats.

Few people in the West are giving up on democracy as the ideological alternative remain deeply unappealing - look at China, we worry about them but don't want to emulate them.

This is another story: at the start of the twentieth century democracy was an untested form of politics that aroused wild hopes and wild fears - over time, democracy has strengthened and spread.

Once it reaches a certain level of prosperity, democracy reinforces itself - the arrival of material comforts the high risk, high stakes game of authoritarian politics loses its appeal - there seems to be a demographic threshold for stable democracies. Countries where the median age is in the twenties are less likely to wait out a crisis - they want immediate results.

In many of these places democracy looks fragile, in some it looks practically impossible. But where it is established it looks secure.

The existence of these thresholds is hard to square with uncertainty generated by repeated democratic crises. One way to keep the doubts about democracy alive is to raise the threshold for what counts as proof of durability - [[Kenneth Arrow]] argues that democratic decision making would have to be constrained if it was not to be entirely arbitrary on the account that there's nothing such as a stable democracy.

It is possible to adjust the time frame - any lasting success or failure can be looked by expanding the horizon or present. Nothing therefore gets resolved. The real story is that the long and short view must coexist - one must never trump the others. The ongoing success of democracy creates the conditions for repeated failures just as repeated failures are a precondition for ongoing success.

It is impossible to find the line that separates success from failure. They go hand in hand. Lots of little failures combine to produce lasting success. What we don't know is if these may create lasting failures.

Present-day Greece is well above the relevant thresholds for democratic stability - is still over 25,000 and the median age if 43. It is unlikely that if the present crisis worsens, GDP continues to fall - it is hard to see how democracy can remain secure if the median age continues to rise as societies with an imbalance of pensioners to wage earners will have a great difficulty paying their way.

Stable democracies like Denmark focus on the details of their politics and how to improve it - secure democracies though are not all alike. Denmark is different from the US and Japan - the spread of democracy has increased the variety of democratic experiences.

The evidence of those experiments is growing all the time - Finland for education, Canada for banking, Australia for environmental safeguards. Many of these experiments is subject to its own forms of democratic skittishness, and remain bad at learning from each other's examples: they still tend to privilege their own experiences.

At the same time, the world's democracies are more interconnected. Failure in one place can lead to repercussions somewhere else. The spread and growth of democracy has generated the possibility of collective failure. The advantages of democracy are inseparable from the risks - the long-term strength comes from its short-term restlessness.

Four challenges where democracy has performed poorly:

#### War 305

First, democracies do not go to war with each other. Second, democracies win far more often than they lose. Democratic peace theory helped to promote a reckless optimism about fighting wars for peace. 

The reason that democracies do not fight each other is connected to the reason that democracies do not often lose the wars they fight - the structure of democratic politics make democratic politicians wary of needless conflict, reminded of the costs and risks. When they find themselves at war, they are less likely than autocrats to fall prey to wishful thinking.

The success of democracy in war and peace calls the 'untimeliness' of democratic life than with any superior grasp of what is at stake - democracies find it harder than autocracies to commit to war as there are too many competing interests. When those interests align, this provides insulation against war between democracies, making it hard for any democracies to get their act together.

Mistakes will keep happening. Democracies find themselves engaged in military conflicts conducted away from the public - the institutional barriers in the way of garnering public support for war can result in bypassing the public.

The difficulty of holding public support makes long wars dangerous for democracies - distractions get in the way.

The spread of democracy has lessened the likelihood of war in many parts of the world. But forcing the advantages of democracy tend to undermine them - it does not work to accelerate the progress of democracy in the hopes of accepting the progress of peace. It makes it likely that wars will slip between the gaps of democratic attention spans.

The relationship between democracy and war will continue to be unstable - two reasons, democracies distance themselves and will create the space for military misadventures. Second, where a preference for peace is entrenched, only major shocks will be capable for generating the popular support required for war. A war between the EU and someone is possible but given the inherent difficulties of aligning the people of Europe it can lead to a significant disruption.

This democratic peace is self-reinforcing but not self-fulfilling: war does not disappear, it becomes harder to control.

### Finance 309

The benefits of having free markets goes along with repeated short-term failures: this produces growth in the long run punctuated by regular crises and mishaps. Market participants are not good at spotting which are the real crises and mishaps.

Markets go through endless dislocations that serve to conceal their underlying problems - well-functioning markets can be efficient but the confidence in the market turns to over-confidence, confidence leads to a crash, the crash produces a crisis of confidence.

Markets fall victim to their own success. They run on confidence and become overconfident. Democracies do not only go wrong when they come to place excessive faith in markets - the successful regulation of market is subject to the inherent tendency of democracies to be spoiled by success. Lessons learned creates room for mistakes.

Bigger cycles: democracies have long-term advantages, credibility for the repayment of debts that allows them to borrow more cheaply. The institutional constraints that operate on democratic leaders make it hard to behave irresponsibly. At the same time the short-term pressures that operate on democratic leaders makes it harder for them to impose fiscal discipline.

The most apocalyptic warnings argue that this tendency to push their luck will lead democracies to ruin - this is scaremongering. American democracy is not going to indulge itself to that extent. The institutional constraints on sustained fiscal irresponsibility would kick in before them.

### Environment 313

Why has democracies done nothing to tackle climate change?

One explanation - the science of climate change is too complicated for democratic publics to understand. Faced with complexity most people retreat it what they can understand - meanwhile, the short-term costs of taking action can immediately felt.

A complaint: democratic people don't know what good there is. But this is hard to square: western democracies promoted scientific achievement and technological advances; their public submitted to the advantages these brought.

An alternative argument: democracies know they are not stupid and will take necessary action when required. The fact that we did all that could make us think that we'll get around dealing with this when we need to, confident that we have their act together.

A danger of overconfidence: an assumption that any difficulty you face is a replication of some difficulty that you have overcome. Drawing encouragement from the historical record makes it hard to know if this time will be different.

Another risk is that meeting past challenges ignores how different those challenges were - tackling climate changes requires a combination of democratic adaptability that do not sit together. Established democracies can pull together when the threat gets too big to ignore, or when their ability to stop experimenting so that the danger doesn't become overwhelming.

Optimists insists that technological innovation will solve the problem, but this can be fatalism - crying wolf, ruling it out until no one can doubt it. Waiting too long? Do we need to draw on the collective resilience of democratic societies to combat climate change?

They just don't know how to access their strengths.


### Rivals 

China is said to have an advantage over the West - they can take decisive action, impose short-term costs and more. This is the benefit of autocratic systems that they can think about the long term in the short term. It is a limited benefit because autocratic regimes are less likely to own up to their mistakes.

We are caught in a sense of our relative weakness - Chinese are not constrained by ideology, checks and balances, can enforce technocratic solution and more. For now, they are successful in managing the crash of 2008, don't fight wars for morality, can be pragmatic.

Yet long run autocratic regimes struggle to match the rising expectations of their populations and their growing demand for a greater say in their government. China is still a poor country in terms of per capita GDP and it has had a vast population.

Democracy has the long term advantages but it risks being out-maneuverer by less decisive autocratic regimes - creating a dangerous world in which both sides will miscalculate.

Democracies need plausible rivals in order to puncture their complacency - democracies need autocracies to keep them honest but autocracies are dangerous as it draws them into volatile relationships.

Democratic regimes, the author summarizes, can try something new: flexibility within limits (if you look at the Arab Spring). Democracy's current rivals are less encumbered by ideology and can draw on technical expertise: as information technology adapts, this is a weakness. What it can't do is modify its own power to make the best use of the Internet - it remains vulnerable to any technology that is more adaptable than it is.

Democracy has its advantages but its no better than its rivals at accessing those advantages.

# EPILOGUE

People have to believe in democracy for it to work, realising that nothing is wrong. This mismatch of living in the moment and displaying its success over time creates confusion - we have to live with them.

There is no moment for recognition - the moment will never arrive.

For evidence, you can look at the afterword which discusses Trump.
