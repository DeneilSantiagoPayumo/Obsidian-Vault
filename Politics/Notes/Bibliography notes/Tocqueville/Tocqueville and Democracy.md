[[Democracy in America]]
Stephen Holmes

Tocqueville claims that his book is made into "one pregnant thought".
"Extreme freedom corrects the abuse of freedom, and extreme democracy forestalls the dangers of democracy."

## A democratic cure for a democratic disease

23 (1)

Tocqueville claims that democracy in a social sense is inevitable - an inescapable feature of the modern world while democracy in a political sense is a product of human freedom.

Social levelling produces a predilection for democratic social rule as we eye ball the upper class and realise that they don't excel us morally, intellectually and humanly.

His paradoxical thesis - the democracy of politics can forestall the consequence of the democratic social. Legislators should use self-government to re-channel the egalitarian flood.

What did Tocqueville stand against?
His argument was against men who were "enemies of all progress" - those that misjudged "the great democratic revolution". They believe they can reverse the flow of history: they were opposed to democratization.

The weightiest piece of evidence Tocqueville produces is the United States itself: "There is no country in the world harbouring fewer germs of revolution than America". French conservatives believed that social order is impossible without legal inequality but America shattered the ultraroyalist view - showing that democracy does not entail anarchy, upheaval, spoliation and murder.

America reveals what democracy can be like when freed from resistance of reactionary forces - democracy was irritable and threatening in France because conservatives continue to wage war against it.

Democratic government can help prevent another revolution. At the heart of democracy lies a recipe for damage limitation - the collapse of land-based aristocracy is irreversible. It's noxious aftereffects can be mitigated by popular self-rule.

## The inherent defects of democratic government 26 (5)

On the other hand, popular government can offer an efficient remedy to a massive problem. Political democracy is massively deficient on almost every conceivable dimension.

Democratic governments tend to handle public business with lavish incompetence - people manage public affairs very badly. They have myopic and exhibit less self-control.

Elections are just another forum in which people give rein to "the democratic sentiment of envy" - admirable qualities are rare. The envy of the talented is also involved: the problem of mediocre elected officials is heightened by the unwillingness of talented men to throw their hats. In an egalitarian society, individuals prefer to pursue wealth than political power.

Politicians thereof are passive and enslaved.

The ultimate source of the defects is the obtuseness of the majority itself: the majority urges officials to attack the national bank without the idea of what the national bank does. The majority is constantly impulsive so majoritarian politics lead to legislative and administrative instability. Representatives are elected every term, rinsing all memory of what the government had done.

The source of the problem lies within the majority, with its immaturity and rashness: short-sighted and unable to formulate long-term goals, unable to stick to a plan. Democratic government can never accomplish greater deeds.

The diagnosis becomes grimmer and the paradox more paradoxical: public discussion can intensify social conflicts. It encourages political polarization, ideological intransigence and a loss of contact with reality. Additionally, public discussions provides information overload.

Tocqueville has another concern: the oppressiveness of democratic rule. There is no intellectual pluralism in the United States and thus no serious public debate: dominated by a monolithic power that cannot be exploited. Dissenters are brought in line.

Yet, democracy liberty brings greater blessings than the ills. Egalitarian societies can provide 4 ills that democratic governments provide a cure for:
1. A deficit of authority
2. The prestige of radical factions
3. Bonapartist dictatorship
4. Psychological torpor that results from a concentration on private

## Creating obedience to the law 29 (7)

With the erosion of religious piety and class deference? Tocqueville believes that political democracy motivates ordinary citizens to obey the law. Laws are ineptly drafted but at least people observe them. No one will attack the institution of private property if he owns the property themselves.

Self-government produces a psychological tendency to obey the law which cannot be explained by the fact that democratic laws serve the interests of the governed - people are emotionally attached to their government because they take part in it, taking pride in the prosperity of their country because they have created it.

Democratic government would be impossible therefore if the losers in electoral politics were not willing to acquiesce in the decisions made by winners: anticipation of one day being part of the winning coalition leads citizens to treat the majority right as something precious that must be preserved. They can stick with the law because they believe they can change it tomorrow.

## Domesticating radical factions 31 (10)

His argument about universal suffrage: universal suffrage hands the fate of society over to the poor. His real argument applies to the utility of universal suffrage 0 its utility from a conservative point of view.

In a modern nation such as France, public opinion is going to make itself felt one way or another. If public opinion cannot express itself through political associations. Popular government is a safety valve and vents public steam.

Universal suffrage must be in the same light - in any egalitarian society, the will of the majority has high moral prestige. The only effective solution is to construct political institutions that make it impossible for minority factions to claim the right to speak for the majority. Only one institution can do this: universal suffrage. In the absence of universal suffrage, faction leaders claim to speak for the people as a whole. Who can prove that they can't?

When the franchise is restricted, factions become aggressive. The chance to achieve one's aim through persuasion and electioneering is a social sedative. The more democratic the system, the less revolutionary it will be.

## Preventing Caesarism 32 (11)

Popular governments generate social loyalties, a willingness to obey the law and dampens the zeal, undermining the status of political militants and radicals. Its function is to prevent the reappearance of a Bonapartist dictatorship. This argument is least developed.

If citizens become absorbed in private life, they will leave the political stage to be taken over by an ambitious strongman - when citizens focus on their private advantages, those private advantages may be lost. America is protected against incipient Bonapartism by the intensity of popular attention to public affairs.

## The "greatest advantage" of democratic government 33 (12)

[[John Stuart Mill]] claimed that freedom of the press, public discussion and more will produce political decisions that are more intelligent than decisions made by closed and autocratic regimes.

Tocqueville argues that representative democracies create foolish decisions. Their indirect social effects are what key: its good qualities are revealed only in the long run..

 It is certainly not the elected magistrates who make the American democracy prosper, but the fact that the magistrates are elected.

By electing their rulers, they can produce mediocre governance but transform themselves into energetic individuals: it spreads a 'restless activity'. Democracy creates agitation. The main benefit of government through populary elected is social vitality. They produce resources and wealth more than any kind of government by imbuing a spirit of activity and cooperative adventurism.

In his conclusion, Tocqueville considers the expansion of the English race than lower Canada. The answer? Free people find it easier to create flourishing colonies.

Two dimensions: America is both safer and more energetic than France - both less revolutionary and more on the move. Democracy has brought political instability and psychological damage in France - France has resisted democracy and liberalization, making society more dangerous politically.

## The paradox of political associations 35 (14)

The way Tocqueville supplements and deviates from his central thesis can be explored by looking first at his famous chapter on the relation between political and economic associations.

Rulers in France are deeply suspicious of political associations but warmly supportive of associations in the economic sphere ... cooperation is contagious. Daily experience of political association gives citizens the ideas of civil associations. Politics spread a general habit and taste for associations.

The idea that people can become immensely powerful if they act in concert is not self-evident. How can this be learned? Democratic politics. The advantages people gain by political cooperation teaches them the value of association in general.

Citizens are drawn together politically, and it is easy to introduce people to the values of associations this way. Through political associations, Americans gain a taste of economic associations: they transport their habits into the affairs of civil life and put them to numerous uses.

The cure for freedom is more freedom. but in general, the freedom of political associations favours the welfare and tranquillity of the citizens.

## Democratic politics and commercial life 37 (16)

Participation in political associations favour public tranquillity by driving citizens into private life. More politics produces less politics.

As a participant in collective efforts, each citizen is psychologically encouraged to invest in his own property: the experience of political associations in the commercial sphere leads to quick results. Freedom is favourable to the production of wealth.

Democratic politics brings prosperity and makes commercial society thrive. In Volume 2, Tocqueville believes that the absorption in private affairs that generates tranquillity will expose society to a Bonapartist coup and even to the politics of arbitrary confiscation.

An active polity spawns an active economy. If the economy becomes all absorbing, citizens will cease participating in politics altogether. Privatization may solve the problem of revolution but it produces the problem of Caesarism.

The more robust, lively and time-consuming economic life becomes, the greater is the threat it poses to political freedom and economic prosperity.

## Perspectives on commercial society 38 (17)

When Tocqueville argues that democratic politics can solve the problems of democracy, it can solve the problems of commercial society. He puts emphasis on the effects of commercialism on the individual's soul.

Tocqueville did not approach the problems of commercial society in a value-neutral way. Biblical and chivalric norms conspired a revulsion towards commercial society.

## Political cures for commercial ills 39 (18)

Democratic politics rescues modern individuals from the degrading focus on their own well-being encouraged by commercial society.
 "The Americans have used liberty to combat individualism born of equality, and they have won."

The beneficial effects of political participation on the individual far outweigh the defects of majoritarian government - ordinary people are certain to bungle the handling of public affairs. Democratic government is a machine for awakening the mind and lifting individuals in the concerns of others.

Let's try and integrate this with what Tocqueville argues about the relationship between democratic government and economic life.

Democratic government has two effects:
- It launches citizens into the exciting adventure of commerce
- It rescues them from the filthy ditch of commerce

Political participation propels energized individuals into the economic domain and rescues enervated individuals from the economic domain. Tocqueville doesn't reconcile these ideas.

He does not consistently describe the economic sphere as degraded. Commercial life is motored by an "immaterial interest" - Economic activity is not instrumental but consummatory. It gives meaning to life, and people love the activity more than the result.

Effort expended is counted among the benefits - economic life is not a sphere of meaningless drudgery of which democratic politics can save.

## Commercial cures for political ills 40 (19)

Commercialism may provide an indispensable remedy for the defects of political democracy.

One problem:
Those in office will have a large incentive to subvert the entire system if, on being ousted, they will not find a suitable life. But in the US, a lively economy provides an essential prop for a democratic polity.

Commercialism also helps quell the dangers of democratic factionalism. Commerce is a social coolant. Americans are political active without being revolutionary. The commercial ethic has more or less the same effect on the political temperature as universal suffrage. It demilitarizes factions and domesticates them into parties ready to compromise.

Economic prosperity also increases social mobility. Rapid upward and downward mobility may seem chaotic but it softened potential social cleavages.

## Mutual support of the public and private realms 41 (20)

This suggests that being saved from commerce by politics may be desirable in some situations. In other setting, people will need to be saved from politics by commerce.

Tocqueville presents his insights in such a a balanced way - this escape from commerce into democratic politics is good, but not good: it should not be carried into an extreme.

This happy coexistence of public and private spheres is what Tocqueville found in the United States. Democratic politics and a commercial economy are mutually supportive - there is "a close and necessary link between these two things, that is, freedom and industry." America is a commercial republic and it encourages energetic participation in economic and political life.

In America, there is no inherent contradiction or incompatibility between the public and the private. Rather, Americans are mobilized politically to protect their interests, materially understood. Political democracy does not require citizens to transcend their interests: a concern for oneself does not lead to a neglect of one's neighbour only because each citizen is aware of "the close connection between his private profit and the general interest."

The citizen takes an interest in democratic politics because democratic politics serves their interests.

The meaning of life in America is derived wholly from politics. Life in the United States is neither too public nor too private. The mutually supportive relation of public and private action explains why Tocqueville can describe Americans can be devoted to both politics and society.

## Straddling two traditions 43 (22)

Tocqueville does not view politics like [[Hannah Arendt]] as an alternative to the economic sphere.
He does not, like Milton Friedman, view commercial life as a self-sufficient realm, flourishing best when freed from the damaging intrusion of politics. He takes a middle way.

How does Tocqueville lay his sympathy? Peace or excitement? Adventure and Sewage? It is both / and. In brief, commerce and democratic politics are mutually interdependent.

## Politics cures for politic ills 44 (23)

Another aspect -  the ill in question is itself political (dangerous political associations) while the cure is directly political (complete freedom of political association) and indirectly economic (the proliferation of industrial and commercial associations).

The democratic government is plagued by defects. He draws our attention to various ways in which problems of democratic government can be solved.

Take the 'anticipation effect' where members of an outvoted minority respect the majority decision in the hope and expectation that they will be part of a winning coalition. By neglecting this self-inhibiting mechanism (that members of an electoral majority might treat the outvoted minority with tenderness), he makes majoritarian politics more unshackled than it actually turns to be.

American conformism solves a key problem of democratic politics - debate produces polarization and factional animosity. In the United States, conformist pressures guarantee that there is no real debate.

Tocqueville does rely on the argument that a majority in power will be self-limiting. In the new egalitarian and commercial society, female chastity cannot be protected by sheltering them - we must habituate young girls to take responsibility. You must expose them to the dangerous consequences of their choices.

Following [[Edmund Burke]], French conservatives condemn the French revolutionaries for their abstract rationalism. Tocqueville argues that ordinary people will be cured of abstractions once they are saddled with day-to-day responsibility for the governance of their communities.

To awaken reactionary sympathy, Tocqueville portrays democratic institutions as saddles strapped onto the sagging backs of the lower orders. Democracy compels subjects to be involved in political decision making and mitigate the noxious side effects.

## Antidemocratic cures for democratic ills 46 (25)

Tocqueville describes various constitutional and semi constitutional devices as essential mechanisms for inhibiting the tyrannical potential of majoritarian politics. In America, the executive branch cannot limit the enormous power of Congress.

Bicameralism is a great example of a tyranny-prevention device. The majority's will is respected and refined. Federalism also helps to preserve public tranquillity by obstructing the rapid communication of mass hysteria.

The most important device for suppressing the tyrannical potentials of majoritarian politics is the judiciary: lawyers help remedy the defects of democratic government. Lawyers are trusted by the people unlike other elites. They are naturally strongly opposed to the revolutionary spirit - they reinforce the moderating influence of commercialism. They do not want to overthrow democracy, however, but merely to "guide it". In summarizing these points, Tocqueville cannot help but argue that "the legal body forms the most powerful and, so to say, the only counterbalance to democracy."

Juries have several functions: they improve the soul of the jurors by making men pay attention to things other than their own affairs.

The jury system has a political effect - it gives those who serve an education in the laws and teaches them responsibility as well. The judge will always stage-manage the trial and control the jury's verdict. This system is an example of pseudo democracy - a screen for keeping power in the hands of an antidemocratic elite.

Tocqueville's analysis of the jury system is ambiguous because it suggests that as they become educated by judges, people learn to rule themselves and that the heteronomous arrangement whereby the "juror pronounce the decision made by the judge" will last forever.

## Local Government 48 (27)

Tocqueville stresses the tyranny-preventing function of decentralized power. He states that "a democracy without provincial institutions has no guarantee against such ills". On this account, local government has a negative function: municipal institutions are antidemocratic obstacles to the popular will.

He gives the "reoccupation thesis": political associations and municipal government "take the place" occupied by the nobility in the Middle Ages.

Tocqueville claims that local government is a remedy for license as well as for absolute power. This addition suggests that decentralized decision-making bodies have a positive function, alongside their negative one. They can enlist or mobilize them. These are barriers restraining their ambition.

## The transition to democracy 49 (28)

Tocqueville's doubt about the usefulness in France of the American model are expressed in his account of the transition to democracy in the two cases.

Tocqueville wanted to save France ... but he saw this as impossible. The second volume showcases his pessimism.

Why was the US able to maintain a stable democracy?
1. Cheap land which reduced pressures on the political system from the poor
2. The absence of any significant militiary threat
3. No tradition of hostility between republicanism and religion
4. No city comparable in size to Paris
5. No aristocratic past needing to be overthrown by violence
6. The existence of the frontier

This cannot be imitated in France.

America is a land of unreachable perfection, that makes the French wince with the recognition of how badly off they are, and always will be.
