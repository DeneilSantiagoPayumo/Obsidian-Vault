[[Democracy in America]]

Alexis de Tocqueville thought of United States as a country created created and populated by Anglo-Americans - they had come from England, Scotland, and Ireland, but had created something new - a society built on social equality.

He dealt with its most glaring defects - the institutions of slavery and the treatment of the Indians. One could envisage examples of American democracy being a hypocritical fraud because of its near annihilation of the indigenous population, slavery and prejudice.

Tocqueville was aware of this, was sensitive of the Indians and of the fact of slavery and treatment of blacks even in the states where slavery had been abolished. For the white population, however, social equality and democracy were a reality, far surpassing anything yet seen in Europe. As Tocqueville as prophetically wrote this was the wave of the future. Thus it was essential to understand how American democracy worked - its virtues, its defects, and its dangers.

Yet however muted the discussion of slavery and the fate of the Indians was in most of Democracy In America. Tocqueville was well aware of the great flaw in the American experiment that threatened to bring it to the end.

Yet for the purposes of his analysis he had to set aside the issue of race and the fate of the Indians.

One reason we was able to put this aside was because Gustave de Beaumont was going to take up the subject in his own work, *Marie, or Slavery in the United States*.

Today, Americans are accustomed to seeing themselves as a nation of immigrants continually being reshaped by the influx of new people all over the world. He had very little to say about the ethnic aspect of "diversity".

Tocqueville and Beaumont knew that America was diverse, yet they did not notice any significant role for languages other than English or significant cultural differences based on ethnic origin.

Thus the diversity that most impressed the two young visitors was the presence of the Indians and the slaves.

### The Fate of the Indians

Tocqueville was distressed about the plight of the Indians but had no way of mitigating their fate: they were incapable of resisting the advances of the whites and he saw their disappearance as being only a matter of time - the New England Indians were already gone.

Matters were different in the South, where major Indian nations, the Cherokees, Creeks, and Choctaw were adapting themselves to agriculture. The Indian were "persuaded" to give up their land.

He concludes this section with a powerful irony:

The Spaniards pursued the Indians with bloodhounds, like wild beasts; they sacked the New World like a city taken by storm ... destruction.

### Slavery and Its Consequences

When it came to the blacks, Tocqueville saw no solution to the problems their presence created for America - they had no truck with the idea of racial inequality.

In the penitentiaries he visited, he noted the presence of a lot of blacks but suggested no difference between blacks and whites.

Tocqueville's discussion of slavery, namely that slavery had devastating consequences for economic development and also for the characters of slaveholders and slaves alike. Tocqueville describes the economy effects of slavery on his steamboat voyage down the Ohio River - he points that the river did not permit the entry of blacks at all.

The second idea was that freedom for blacks in the North had done little to solve the problem of relations between the races. Many of the rights that free blacks had attained could not be done so without inciting a riot.

Third, even the abolition of slavery in the South offered no solution to the problem of race relations. Abolition would bring no relief for the blacks - "slavery recedes, but the prejudice to which it has given birth is immovable ... the prejudice of race seems to be stronger in the states that have abolished slavery than in those where it still exists."

He concluded that the "formidable of all ills that threaten the future of the Union arises from the presence of a black population upon its territory."

Tocqueville believes there were "but two chances for the future: the Negroes and the whites must part or mingle."

Those who appear to believe that the Europeans can ever be amalgamated with the Negroes appear to me to delude themselves. Nothing is more written than the emancipation of blacks, that the two races will never live in a state of equal freedom under the same government, so insurmountable are the barriers which nature, habit and opinion have established between them.

You also can't migrate to Africa - abolition would not be equal. These grim remarks appended to a study of American democracy that applauded what it had done for human dignity as well as the demonstration it had given the world.

### Democracy vs. Inequality

There are two parts to the first volume - approving of democracy and pointing to the threat posed by slavery and black-white relations.

Yet the gap between them is not wide. Democracy has survived the threat, and there has been an unsteady improvement in the circumstances of blacks and in relations between blacks and whites. Yet American democracy has shown the capacity to address these inequalities.
