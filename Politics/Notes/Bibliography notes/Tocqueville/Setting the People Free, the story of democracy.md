[[Democracy in America]]

Four questions:
1. Why, in the first place, has the word democracy changed so sharply in meaning from the days of Babeuf to those of Donald Trump?
2. Why, in the second place, is the form of government to which it applies always so different from its Greek originals?
3. Why has that drastically different form of government won such extraordinary power across the world, so rapidly and so recently?
4. Why, in the fourth place, should this highly distinctive regime picked the word of all words for its political order?

The first two questions depend on the last two. The third is able to be answered, and can help answer question four.

133

Democracy has altered its meaning so sharply since Babeuf because it has passed definitely from the hands of the Equals to those of the political leaders of the order of egoism - these leaders apply it to the form of government that selects them and enables them to rule, a government that has adapted to the requirements of the order of egoism shaped within the demands to keep that order in working condition.

But what of the fourth question? Why did the strong select this of all words to name the form of government which has served them best of all in their titanic struggle to mould the world to their purposes

136

Is it still right in this stage to think of democracy as a form of government, or a political value, like Tocqueville did - an entire way of life or even economical. After all no viable forms of democracy dares to try to face it down in free and open encounter.

It is true that most states are vastly more powerful in various respects than they have ever been before - government may shift elusively between levels, moving upwards and downwards. But the world we live in is governed more extensively and intimately than it has ever been before.

This form of government is blurred in outline, what causes it to operate is blisteringly obscure. Nobody believes sovereigns are adults qualified from birth: there is more continuing dissention, strife over exclusion, unjust taxation and so on.

The variations of this form of government, Presidential or parliamentary rule, judicial review, contrasting party systems, matter greatly for the politics of any country -they leave little room for doubt that their main purpose is to insulate the rulers from the judgement of the citizens.

What unites them is their acceptance of a single compelling point, deriving the authority to rule, from the entire citizen body over whom it must apply. The claim made by these rulers on their own behalf naturally reaches much further - that the election of representative legislatures and executives provides these electors with control over the laws to which they are subject. This claim is farfetched but not absurd - the predicament of being governed by whom a majority can dismiss is less dire than the predicament of being governed by those who we can only rid themselves of through overthrowing them.

Citizens of modern democracy select from a menu that they can't do much to modify. [[Benjamin Constant]] saw the goal of their choice as stewardship: our interests are managed for us.

[[Schumpeter]] set out his own picture - democracy essentially a competition between teams of politicians for the people's vote and the power to govern which would follow from it. The victors in that competition won the opportunity to govern for a limited period. As a system, electoral democracy was 'the rule of the politician.

One the politicians are picked, there is little doubt we are ruled. It is not simply because modern liberty can take so many forms that the percentage of voters have fallen so much. Some of the fall is best attributed less to a preference for private enjoyment than dismay at what electors got for their votes. At most dismay, a desertion of the electoral forum.

If democracy is simply a way of organizing the relationships between communities and their government, it cannot be an occasion for immense pride: where communities are self-confident, that pride will rub off on their political institutions. Under less ebullient circumstances, the attitudes of communities to their government are likely to be moulded by how groups within them see their own interested as served or damaged by their government, a matter of skill and luck.

The scale of a modern American Presidential campaign could rouse a sense of personal freedom. To run against it, any coherent complaint must in the end be made on behalf of the order of equality and against the order of egoism.

We cannot safely or honourably brush the recognition that it has been the clear verdict of democracy that the struggle between these two orders is one that the order of egoism must win: it is above all democracy which has handed the order of egoism its ever more conclusive victory.

The question raised by that victory: how much can the agenda of equality be rescued from its defeat? Two very different ways: one of institutional architecture with meanings and one of distributive outcomes.

The first way is to attach weight to the sense that democracy can be seen not as a form of which individual states are governed, but as a political value, but every other setting or milieu in which human beings live, can and should be measured.

Democracy promises the democratization of everything. What it entails is the elimination of privilege from the ordering of human life, a vision of how humans can live with one another. It requires the systematic elimination of power, the capacity to make people act against their inclinations, from human relations. It demands the removal of any form of power stable enough to disclose itself to others. The removal of all powers from relations is unlikely to occur, but it is the program of the equals.

it is not adopted by any forms of government. It is a value that might inspire government, but not a coherent description of ordering of power.

The world we live in is a world structured by radicalization and intensification of inequalities - inequalities that need not result in wider gaps in wealth, status or personal power. By principle of economic competition, they work through the sharpening of inequality in the lives of everyone.

It is through practical priority that egoism precludes equality - what there can be is the democratization of human life everywhere.

145

The role of democracy as a political value is to probe constantly the tolerable limits of injustice. The key to the form of life as a whole is a tug of war between two different senses of democracy - the second sense constantly subverts the legitimacy of democracy as an existing form of government. The first imposes its priority on the second.

The imagery of a democratic way of life bites deep and summons imaginative energies. The mobilizing force of the value is negative.

147

The strongest pressures behind democratization are resentment at condescension and the will of the individuals to find groups to better ways to defend their own interests. The power of the first is captured by Tocqueville: it focuses on form and appearance, and presupposes that democracy must surrender privilege at the level of form. It must recognise all citizens as equals and give some opportunity to insist on being treated equally. What it can't do is give them equal power to defend their own interest - stopped by the pervasiveness of inequality dictated by the order of egoism.

Today, ordinary citizens are not present in their capacity in a legislative assembly. They don't hold power, yet are more free to speak than the Athenians ever were.

149

Because this set of practices was never chosen by anyone, every aspect of it could well be different: it scarcely be true that the complex could alter into something drastically different. The key issue for this modern variant of democracy is how far it necessitates a level of alienation.

Modern democracy is principally the citizens very intermittently choosing under constrained circumstances the small number of their fellows who will choose for them. One could argue - what about referendums? Here referendums are always decided by a ruling group of career politicians. Manoeuvres made by politicians. Where their expectation is disappointed, the consequences of adopting the expedient may dismay sponsors but the role of the electors will be to hand the victory to one team of career politicians.

Deliberative democracy attempts to prescribe how a community of human beings should wish for its decisions to be taken.

The order of egoism clashes more drastically with these requirements than it does with orders: as a form of life and a milieu within which to live, it is at best neutral and at worst blankly indifferent.

It is difficult for them to override the structuring principle of the form within which they live. Democracy as a form of government is less open-ended, considerably more determinate and far less audacious in its exploration. Democratization today can be more braver than democratic government because it is not responsible for the order of egoism. 

Representative democracy has equipped itself for the journey by making its peace more explicitly with the order of egoism. It offers a framework where order can flourish and one at which citizens at large can set bounds to its pretension and consequences.

Accompanying democracy's advance is an understandable reluctance on part of those who hold power within them on other basses and by different means at the prospect of being subverted openly and from within - an advance in which human populations are drawn tightly together and depend on their security and prosperity. One facility is the basis on which its human denizens can address the task of ensuring the skill and good intentions of their rulers for themselves.

In the midst of despair, representative democracy has a clear claim to meet a global need than any of its competitors. The need is  urgent and none of the representative democracy's surviving rivals acknowledge the need as clearly.

Seen as a whole, (the struggle to maintain trust in political leadership) this is a disenchanted and demoralized world, well adjusted to lives organized around the struggle to maximize personal income, ready to identify and respond to the most unreliable of cues. Viewed with charity the modern democratic world is strenuous, scanned intermittently by its citizens/

It has little glamour. Had it been rule of the people, it would've fallen into chaos. It offers the inhabitants of the world the safest basis to live with citizens within our own states. Representative democracy cannot be all that we hope for.

There may be two drastic ways in which democracy of today may be altered. One is in the flow and structuring of information amongst citizens and the degree governments restrict and withhold information. The more they withhold information, the less accountable they are to those who give them their authority. Modern representative democracy would have to transform itself very radically in this respect. No powerful imaginative pressures will survive to challenge the judgement that this is how it plainly should be altered.

The second way in which our practice of rule converge more with its democratic title finds itself present - as a word, democracy has won the global competition to designate legitimate rule largely by courtesy of Buonarroti's order of egoism.

A simple perception: that a ruling people cannot confront one another in conditions of acute inequality. For well over a century, capitalist economies faced political pressure from well-organized mass political parties, representing many millions of citizens to compress these inequalities and place all citizens equally. For a moment, these pressures have disappeared. At present though, these inequalities seem impossible to bridge.

For the moment therefore democracy has won its monopoly as the basis for legitimate rule. It remains at odd with existing practices of rule: it clashes systematically and fundamentally with the defining logic of economic organization. Its victory is no mere illusion.

The idea that democracy will define conditions for legitimate rule is a strained line of thought: it ignores the link between adjudication and coercion in defining the state, thinks away the chasm of power and wealth between different populations, sets aside the factors which have caused it to win, sentimentalizes the sense in which democracy does rule. That said, it gets one thing right: democracy cannot hope hope to provide a recipe for organizing political or economic relations between that country and others until we can do it for us.
