# Part Two: FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST

## Chapter Five: The Seven Deadly Sins - And One Great Virtue - of California Government

There is no more vivid example of the problems of Western government than the contrast between Sacramento and Palo Alto. Sacramento is the capital of the state whereas Palo Alto is the capital of Silicon Valley.

What exactly are the symptoms? Seven things stand out: call them the seven deadly sins of modern government. And will also add one great virtue.

The first sin of California government is that it is out of date. The last time it got a full makeover was in 1879, when the state population was only 865,000 and most Californians worked on the land.

In this California is merely an acid-laced version of Western government as a whole. Overlapping areas of responsibility are common throughout the West. In Australia the federal government runs primary health care but the states run hospitals. In most European countries taxes are raised centrally but spent by local or regional government - the European union plays the same role in Europe that Washington does in America, adding rules and mandates.

There is no simple relationship between modernity and efficiency. Americans revere their constitution because it gets more right than wrong. The West's ability to form the European Union is a mess of responsibilities such as "what is this for?" The madness of setting up a single currency without a common system of financial regulation is obvious. New is not always better.

### BAUMOL's DISEASE

California has been useless at making the public sector more efficient.
William Baumol (1966) argues that productivity increases much more slowly in labour-intensive industries than in industries where capital in the form of machinery can be substituted for labour. Governments inevitably get bigger as they occupy labour-intensive areas of the economy. Manufacturing keeps on getting more efficient but labour-intensive service sectors don't.

As people get richer, they are willing to spend their money on education and health, resulting in health-care services increasing prices as standards rise.

Much of history is a struggle against Baumol's disease. There is very little anyone could do to stop the state from getting bigger.

### OLSON'S LAW

Mancur Olson (1965) is the other name - interest groups have a huge advantage in democracies. Getting organized is a pain, requiring money, time and energy, so narrow constituencies have more than likely to do the organizing than broad constituencies, pursuing goals that matter deeply to them, are much more likely to do the organizing than broad constituencies, pursuing general goals and plagued by free riders who want to enjoy the benefits of political action without incurring the costs.

California - male WASPs (White Anglo Saxon protestants) who want to keep taxes down and their power intact. At the most extreme, the rich wall themselves off in gated communities, with their own security guards, health services, and schools. They only want a check for taxes, the check being small.

Heart of modern crony capitalism - explains why so many subsidies go to so many people.

Olson's law applies to the public sector itself.

...

This clout pays off in two big ways. One is that it is very hard to sack a public-sector working. A minuscule of 0.3 percent of California teachers are dismissed after three or more years. The other payoff comes in benefits. Salary for instance.

Throughout the West politicians have 'back loaded' public-sector pay deals, keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous.

This faction dominates because it's playing a much longer game than the politicians who come and go, not to mention the citizens who rarely read the enormous owner's manual for the Rube Goldberg machine they feed with their dollars. They rarely stay outraged long enough to make a difference.

### THE OVERACTIVE STATE 49

The proliferation of rules that government produces and their complexity. The overactivity that creates the most heartache. California invents new ways of raising taxes.

Tax is only one part of the regulatory burden.

Much of this is just Olson's law at work - industries lobby for exceptions or regulations that once created, justify jobs. Take occupational legislation. The cost of this is huge. Job growth is higher in unregulated occupations than regulated ones.

New laws in California have admirable aim: cleaner air, less discrimination. They are however cumbersome and difficult to remove. We could follow Texas and have legislatures meet only occasionally. 

### FUZZY MATH 50

Balancing the state's budget requires lots of tricks like raising taxes and building up unfunded liabilities.

California - unfunded liabilities is officially 128 billion.

America's states admit as of 2013 their pension programs are only 73 percent funded. The federal government's numbers are little better. Vagueness about numbers is a curse of the public sector. In the worst cases it borders on the criminal. Even in well run places it is hard to get reliable figures - changing of measurements, accounting, hidden as tax deductions.

Obfuscation is worse - the revenue side of government is comically complicated. Tax codes almost everywhere are riven with subsidies, exemptions and complications that favour the rich and are not explained. Dodgy numbers are to the government's disadvantage: how can you plan for the future when you can't distinguish among different types of expenditures?

### TO THOSE WHO HAVE, MORE SHALL BE GIVEN 52

The final sin is that the government is no longer 'progressive'. Government spending cascades toward the old and the relatively well off. In California both the plutocrats and the poor do badly out of government. The former pay for a big chunk.

This again is typical. Turn to the spending side of the ledge and the poor do even worse. America is not generous when it comes to unemployment insurance and other cash transfers and it does much less than other rich countries to help with preschool education.

Europeans like to think of themselves as being 'kinder' to the poor than Americans. Whether it is kind to give the poor as much as Europe does is a long argument: Handouts have a nasty habit of entrenching dependency.

The one thing that both continents have in common is that state spending favours the old overs the young. The big losers from the generational struggle are the young.

This is Olsen's law writ large.

### POLITICAL PARALYSIS AND PARTISAN GRIDLOCK 52

Sixty years ago California's politics was rather cosy.

It is fashionable to blame this animosity on partisan media channels such as Fox News or on the blogosphere. But the problem is deeper than that - Californians are choosing to live in like-minded places. The result is that politicians can get their party's votes only if they appeal to the extreme.

Washington is more paralysed - unable to pass a budget. At a time when Americans are more pessimistic about their country's future prospect than at any point since Gallup first started asking them in 1959.

The eurozone is an even worse fix, lumbered with bigger economic problems and a more dysfunctional political system. Europe may lack the ideological battles that divide Republicans and Democrats. Most politicians are pragmatic centrists. Europe is paralyzed by a tug of war.

This is scaring talent away from a public sector that is disfigured by low pay and rigid hierarchies.

### MEET THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF ALL: YOU 54

The most worrying thing about all is that they are part of the human condition - the product of surrendering too much power to special interest. It is the product of giving power to the people.

California is the best example of the perils of democracy. Californians have used that power in completely predictable ways - to vote themselves more entitlement and lower taxes.

Walter Bagehot liked to argue that the best safeguard against excessive taxation is parliamentary sensitivity to public opinion. He does not take into account the public's ability to want low taxes and big government - and politician's ability to provide with what they wanted. Westerners wanted low taxes and shedding red tape but not when it meant getting fewer services or unsafe meat.

### AND THE ONE GREAT VIRTUE

Something has changed under Brown - the Greece of America is beginning to fix itself. It has the most important step for all substance abusers: admitting that it has a problem. Brown has balanced the budget, and authorities now project budget surpluses some time into the future.

There is a rebirth of centrist pragmatism. Another is Nicolas Berggruen's Think long Committee. It has sponsored initiatives and worked closely with Brown. That still leaves a lot to be fixed including the pensions. The fiscal balance depends heavily on the rich.

Change is coming to the country that was at the centre of our three and a half revolutions. Cameron has introduced braver reforms in education, where around half the state schools have now contracted out in one way or another so they can set their teachers' pay, and welfare, where payments are being simplified and capped.

Progress is slow, resistance is strong and reversals are all too common.

# Chapter 6 - the Asian Alternative

...

## THE JOY OF GOOD SOCIAL ORDER

It is the rise of China has made the Asian alternative fashionable. It would be wrong to claim that China is merely. It is wrong to claim that China is merely Singapore writ large. There is a small matter of Communist ideology.
