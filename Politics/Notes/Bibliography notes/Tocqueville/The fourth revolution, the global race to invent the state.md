# Part Two: FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST

## Chapter Five: The Seven Deadly Sins - And One Great Virtue - of California Government

There is no more vivid example of the problems of Western government than the contrast between Sacramento and Palo Alto. Sacramento is the capital of the state whereas Palo Alto is the capital of Silicon Valley.

What exactly are the symptoms? Seven things stand out: call them the seven deadly sins of modern government. And will also add one great virtue.

The first sin of California government is that it is out of date. The last time it got a full makeover was in 1879, when the state population was only 865,000 and most Californians worked on the land.

In this California is merely an acid-laced version of Western government as a whole. Overlapping areas of responsibility are common throughout the West. In Australia the federal government runs primary health care but the states run hospitals. In most European countries taxes are raised centrally but spent by local or regional government - the European union plays the same role in Europe that Washington does in America, adding rules and mandates.

There is no simple relationship between modernity and efficiency. Americans revere their constitution because it gets more right than wrong. The West's ability to form the European Union is a mess of responsibilities such as "what is this for?" The madness of setting up a single currency without a common system of financial regulation is obvious. New is not always better.

### BAUMOL's DISEASE

California has been useless at making the public sector more efficient.
William Baumol (1966) argues that productivity increases much more slowly in labour-intensive industries than in industries where capital in the form of machinery can be substituted for labour. Governments inevitably get bigger as they occupy labour-intensive areas of the economy. Manufacturing keeps on getting more efficient but labour-intensive service sectors don't.

As people get richer, they are willing to spend their money on education and health, resulting in health-care services increasing prices as standards rise.

Much of history is a struggle against Baumol's disease. There is very little anyone could do to stop the state from getting bigger.

### OLSON'S LAW

Mancur Olson (1965) is the other name - interest groups have a huge advantage in democracies. Getting organized is a pain, requiring money, time and energy, so narrow constituencies have more than likely to do the organizing than broad constituencies, pursuing goals that matter deeply to them, are much more likely to do the organizing than broad constituencies, pursuing general goals and plagued by free riders who want to enjoy the benefits of political action without incurring the costs.

California - male WASPs (White Anglo Saxon protestants) who want to keep taxes down and their power intact. At the most extreme, the rich wall themselves off in gated communities, with their own security guards, health services, and schools. They only want a check for taxes, the check being small.

Heart of modern crony capitalism - explains why so many subsidies go to so many people.

Olson's law applies to the public sector itself.

...

This clout pays off in two big ways. One is that it is very hard to sack a public-sector working. A minuscule of 0.3 percent of California teachers are dismissed after three or more years. The other payoff comes in benefits. Salary for instance.

Throughout the West politicians have 'back loaded' public-sector pay deals, keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous.

This faction dominates because it's playing a much longer game than the politicians who come and go, not to mention the citizens who rarely read the enormous owner's manual for the Rube Goldberg machine they feed with their dollars. They rarely stay outraged long enough to make a difference.

### THE OVERACTIVE STATE 49

The proliferation of rules that government produces and their complexity. The overactivity that creates the most heartache. California invents new ways of raising taxes.

Tax is only one part of the regulatory burden.

Much of this is just Olson's law at work - industries lobby for exceptions or regulations that once created, justify jobs. Take occupational legislation. The cost of this is huge. Job growth is higher in unregulated occupations than regulated ones.

New laws in California have admirable aim: cleaner air, less discrimination. They are however cumbersome and difficult to remove. We could follow Texas and have legislatures meet only occasionally. 

### FUZZY MATH 50

Balancing the state's budget requires lots of tricks like raising taxes and building up unfunded liabilities.

California - unfunded liabilities is officially 128 billion.

America's states admit as of 2013 their pension programs are only 73 percent funded. The federal government's numbers are little better. Vagueness about numbers is a curse of the public sector. In the worst cases it borders on the criminal. Even in well run places it is hard to get reliable figures - changing of measurements, accounting, hidden as tax deductions.

Obfuscation is worse - the revenue side of government is comically complicated. Tax codes almost everywhere are riven with subsidies, exemptions and complications that favour the rich and are not explained. Dodgy numbers are to the government's disadvantage: how can you plan for the future when you can't distinguish among different types of expenditures?

### TO THOSE WHO HAVE, MORE SHALL BE GIVEN 52

The final sin is that the government is no longer 'progressive'. Government spending cascades toward the old and the relatively well off. In California both the plutocrats and the poor do badly out of government. The former pay for a big chunk.

This again is typical. Turn to the spending side of the ledge and the poor do even worse. America is not generous when it comes to unemployment insurance and other cash transfers and it does much less than other rich countries to help with preschool education.

Europeans like to think of themselves as being 'kinder' to the poor than Americans. Whether it is kind to give the poor as much as Europe does is a long argument: Handouts have a nasty habit of entrenching dependency.

The one thing that both continents have in common is that state spending favours the old overs the young. The big losers from the generational struggle are the young.

This is Olsen's law writ large.

### POLITICAL PARALYSIS AND PARTISAN GRIDLOCK 52

Sixty years ago California's politics was rather cosy.

It is fashionable to blame this animosity on partisan media channels such as Fox News or on the blogosphere. But the problem is deeper than that - Californians are choosing to live in like-minded places. The result is that politicians can get their party's votes only if they appeal to the extreme.

Washington is more paralysed - unable to pass a budget. At a time when Americans are more pessimistic about their country's future prospect than at any point since Gallup first started asking them in 1959.

The eurozone is an even worse fix, lumbered with bigger economic problems and a more dysfunctional political system. Europe may lack the ideological battles that divide Republicans and Democrats. Most politicians are pragmatic centrists. Europe is paralyzed by a tug of war.

This is scaring talent away from a public sector that is disfigured by low pay and rigid hierarchies.

### MEET THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF ALL: YOU 54

The most worrying thing about all is that they are part of the human condition - the product of surrendering too much power to special interest. It is the product of giving power to the people.

California is the best example of the perils of democracy. Californians have used that power in completely predictable ways - to vote themselves more entitlement and lower taxes.

Walter Bagehot liked to argue that the best safeguard against excessive taxation is parliamentary sensitivity to public opinion. He does not take into account the public's ability to want low taxes and big government - and politician's ability to provide with what they wanted. Westerners wanted low taxes and shedding red tape but not when it meant getting fewer services or unsafe meat.

### AND THE ONE GREAT VIRTUE

Something has changed under Brown - the Greece of America is beginning to fix itself. It has the most important step for all substance abusers: admitting that it has a problem. Brown has balanced the budget, and authorities now project budget surpluses some time into the future.

There is a rebirth of centrist pragmatism. Another is Nicolas Berggruen's Think long Committee. It has sponsored initiatives and worked closely with Brown. That still leaves a lot to be fixed including the pensions. The fiscal balance depends heavily on the rich.

Change is coming to the country that was at the centre of our three and a half revolutions. Cameron has introduced braver reforms in education, where around half the state schools have now contracted out in one way or another so they can set their teachers' pay, and welfare, where payments are being simplified and capped.

Progress is slow, resistance is strong and reversals are all too common.

# Chapter 6 - the Asian Alternative

...


This matters as Asians are simply working harder at government than the West. in some cases, they see themselves as being in competition with the West.

There are big structural problems with the Asian model - it could be destroyed by the nationalism that propels it forward. They want an all-you-can-eat buffet.

## THE JOY OF GOOD SOCIAL ORDER

It is the rise of China has made the Asian alternative fashionable. It would be wrong to claim that China is merely. It is wrong to claim that China is merely Singapore writ large. There is a small matter of Communist ideology.

The Singaporean model of authoritarian modernization represents a direct challenge to the two basic tenets of the Western state - that government should be democratic and that it should be generous. Lee's model is elitist and stingy.

China's rise - second-largest economy, largest energy consumer, largest merchandise exporter but many issues: Chinese cities make ends meet through landgrabs, buying property on the edge of town and using compulsory purchase orders that seldom pay the landowners property and then sell it on to the developers who in turn sell the houses they build to the richer urban middle classes.

## LEVIATHAN AS CAPITALIST IN CHIEF

State capitalism, argue the Chinese, is a learning device. A great way for China to pick up skills in different industries.

... skipped the entirety of this chapter

Why can China be an alternative: most of the region's government has seen what happened to the west, Asian technology allows them opportunities to go to better social systems and finally that it is trying.



# PART TWO: THE WINDS OF CHANGE

72

The Nordics are important for three reasons: they are part of the west that hit the future first, the settle debates about Leviathan - whether it can be brought under control at all and finally they've exploited the power of technology.

They were forced to change because their old model went bust and they kept on changing to create a better state - Sweden's revolution were marked by frustration, free market ideas crept into the economy, social democrats nationalized the commanding heights of the economy by using trade-union funds to purchase shares in Sweden's biggest companies.

Once they started redesigning their government, they have found out it works - old Nordic model depended on the ability of a cadre of big companies to generate enough money to support the state.

It is possible to contain the government while improving its performance - St. Goran's. Nordics are just the beginning.

The reason? Many on the right claim tougher sentences. The main reason is our ability to prevent crime - police using technology to reduce criminal hotspots, DNA databases and that ordinary people have the technology to fight crime.

It is possible that technology can substitute for human labour - armed drones can kill high-value targets.

## Chapter Nine: What Is the State For? 89

Tocqueville argued that 'a new science of politics is indispensable to a new world'.

This book argues that there has been three new sciences of politics - sciences that are indispensable, politics of the 16th and seventeenth centuries that emphasized sovereign power, the politics of the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries that emphasized individual liberty and the politics of the twentieth century that emphasizes social welfare.

...

The gradually diminishing importance of liberty in the West scares some liberals. For the old ones, mass democracy was terrifying. Democracy may have transferred the power of oppression from the few to the many. Tocqueville, haunted by soft despotism emphasized the importance of devolving power from the center to the localities.

In a way, what the old liberals feared had come to pass - people voted for the state to do more and liberty has suffered. Democracy has grown rather shabby - the subject of our conclusion. The state is backed in a paradox: government backed by democratic will has never been more powerful.

...

Progressive agenda has become self-defeating, each new government department makes it harder for the state to focus on its core functions - state gets bigger because voters want more, voters lose confidence, forces undermine the state's claim to authority

...

# Conclusion: The Democratic Deficit

Tocqueville was worried about soft despotism and the ideas that democratic societies might reduce individuals to the same level of insignificance. It was a powerful tool that needs checks.

Democracy has the ability to waste and exhaust itself - it is overloaded with obligation and distorted by special interests.

Democracy's advance has come to a halt - faring poorly on what is called its frontiers where countries are in flux and history is being made.

The Peterson Foundation calculated that fiscal uncertainty and gridlock has slowed down GDP growth. Also, this takes a toll on America's image. Democracy is simply too democratic and prone to the emotions that vexed Plato and Mill.

Tocqueville may have been nervous about fiddling with checks and balances. Two structural problems gerrymandering and money problem seem alien.

Also, money - united by the pursuit of money. They spend their lives dialling for others to pay for image consultants and more. They add to the complexity of legislation to sneak laws in.

What about the EU? It is threat from above and before, we surrender power to global capitalism, lack of long term interest - cynicality of interests.

Democracy is a universal aspiration. That said, it creates inequality, and seems less golden.

It is an adaptive system that creates welfare states, gives people a peaceful way of living and recruiting talent, reinforces human rights and encourage innovation.
