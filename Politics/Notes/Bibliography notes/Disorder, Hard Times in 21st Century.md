>Getting to grips with the overlapping geopolitical, economic, and political crises faced by Western democratic societies in the 2020s. The 21st century has brought a powerful tide of geopolitical, economic, and democratic shocks. Their fallout has led central banks to create over $25 trillion of new money, brought about a new age of geopolitical competition, destabilised the Middle East, ruptured the European Union, and exposed old political fault lines in the United States. Disorder: Hard Times in the 21st Century is a long history of this present political moment. It recounts three histories - one about geopolitics, one about the world economy, and one about western democracies - and explains how in the years of political disorder prior to the pandemic the disruption in each became one big story. It shows how much of this turbulence originated in problems generated by fossil-fuel energies, and it explains why as the green transition takes place the long-standing predicaments energy invariably shapes will remain in place.

## A collection of key ideas from the text: PART III Democratic Politics

### CHAPTER 7: DEMOCRATIC TIME

#### Nationhood
To understand the instability in present Western democracies, we need to begin with the historical relationship between democracy and nationhood and the problem of political time.

[[Benedict Anderson]] termed the nation as an imagined community. Why should nations be called that? Imagined communities attached to the word nation before the term was employed.

Representative democracies have not historically situated without the political resources that nationhood has provided. (177) For representative democracies, they have to be defined via criteria for inclusion and exclusion - national citizenship. Representative democracies need a political means to procure loser's consent.

If nationhood became entangled in representative democracies, it also proved dangerous to them - "nationhood connected democratic authority to the past and a past with a beginning." (179)

See Ancient Rome and how imaginative effort was expended on locating the republic in the mythological origins of the Roman people. However, since Europe was not divided into a cohesive group of people with shared language, nations are to be made politically. Arguably, the patriotic spirit could be cultivated (see [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]).

"In practice, the imperative for nationhood often led to states' using their own coercive capacity against their own citizens." (180) - governments sought out citizens who spoke the same language, were commonly educated and more. This led to the law being used to impose linguistic and religious uniformity.

See Abraham Lincoln - he used in the Gettysburg Address to take blood spilled in the war and recast the founding of American republic to a story about nationhood.

"Attempts to strengthen nationhood where it was weak, or create it where it was absent, could entail more coercion than a democratic state could bear." (181). Unable to absorb Irish Catholics into an idea of British nationhood, the British democratic state could not accommodate Ireland into its constitutional order.

There had to be people that identified with it and those whose rights had to be denied - democracies were tied up with nationhood and at risk from it.

#### Time and Excess

The passage of time destabilizes all claim to nationhood (182) - "significant changes in geopolitical and economic conditions in time often lead to groups and individuals migrating from one state to another. Where democratic states move to restrict such movements, they then undermine the languages of nationhood used to include past migrants in the idea of national citizenship."

A theory of representative democracies becoming full democracies is misleading: representative democracies had from the start the ability to tax the rich and political moves were made to restrict democratic powers (see 1832 reform act that took the vote away from working class men in English boroughs). Neither did widening the franchise lead to economic reforms benefitting the poorer class. (184)

"Representative democracies have coexisted with forms of economic organisations that frequently produce high levels of material inequality." (185) - see 1894, tax on income levied on the wealthy only for it to be struck down. Representative democracies concentrate authoritative decision-making in a handful of individuals in the executive historically.

Historically, debt is also seen as a cause of democratic excess leading toward democratic dissolution. The burdens of debt can increase overtime and it is a temporal matter: interest is what is paid for early access to future revenue. Ancient societies tried to forgive debt.

The author describes [[Machivaelli]]'s story who thought about debt: external events that imposed that change upon them interrupted the internal temporal cycle. Change could be brought about by renovations where law took states back to origins or a virtuous individual impose himself. For Rome, reforms around debt are important but senatorial opposition to reform ensured that the entire city was topsy-turvy.

#### Excess in the American Republic

"In hard political terms around interests, the struggle over the American constitution was a political fight about debt and territorial expansion." (188) - the US won its independence from Britain and the confederation was unable to service its debt and had no way to finance an army.

Under the articles of Confederation, states had the capacity to tax and service their debts. In contrast, the Confederation Congress had no authority to levy taxes directly. Those who drafted the constitution wanted to establish American creditworthiness by taking power from the state, creating a primary source of taxation for the federal government.

For [[James Madison]], the Senate would be able to defend against democratic excess. For [[Brutus]], the constitution would only lead to the rule of the rich and the rich would rule for themselves (189). 

"In part, politics in the American republic became repeated contests around these debt-driven dynamics and their relationships to class conflicts and competing conceptions of American nationhood." (189)

For the next few decades, the economic aristocracies created by the New York banks and links to railroads dominated the republic's politics through its ability to buy political influence and protect its sectoral monopoly power.
