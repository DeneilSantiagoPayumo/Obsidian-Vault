## A collection of key ideas from the text
### Feminism and Marxism

#### What were the key points of this section?

##### Marxism :

Perceive powerless, first and last, as concrete and externally imposed, it must be concretely and externally undone to be changed.
- "The basic feminist criticism is that these countries do not make a priority of working to change women's status relative to men that distinguishes them from nonsocialist societies in the way that their pursuit of other goals distinguishes them. Capitalist countries value women in terms of their "merit" by male standards; in socialist countries women seem invisible except in their capacity as "workers."" (10) This ignores the unique work that they do.
- Sex equality appears to require  a separate effort - neither technology nor socialism has ever equalized women's status to men.
- Engels explains sexism as an inverse of 'class oppression' - interprets gender through class, convolutes simple realities to understand gender derivatively. 34.
- Engels fails to grasp the impact across classes of women's relationship to the class division itself - double shift. 34.
- "In analyzing women as a group in terms of their role in the family, and men in terms of their role in social production, Engels precludes seeing social relations, inside as well as outside the family, in terms of a sex-based social division ... To consider the home "private" is to privatize women's oppression and to render women's status a question of domestic relations to be analyzed as a derivative of the public sphere, rather than setting the family within a totality characterized by a sexual division of power which divides both home and marketplace." (35)
- "His approach to social explanation is rigidly causal, unidirectional, and one-sided. Material conditions alone create social relations; consciousness and materiality do not interact. Thought contemplates things .... He totally fails to grasp the subject side of the subject/object relation as socially dynamic." (36)

##### Feminism :

- "The underlying sociobiological text of naturalist explanations for unequal social status is that the inherent cause of and continuing justification for their dominance, and the characteristics shared by the subordinate groups cause and justify their subordination. In this way, social conditions become universal givens." (55)  
- "Feminist treatments of childbirth and childrearing reveal other examples of biological based analyses of women's social existence. A biological analysis tends to assume that the meaning of giving birth and rearing a child is fixed ... It is to argue that this effect is a result of the social implications and consequences of motherhood, its impact on how a woman can spend her time, how she is valued socially, the narrowing of her world and options, rather than to anything intrinsic to motherhood. By attributing the lack of self-affirmation to biology rather than to society, Beauvoir accepts the Patriarchal notion that motherhood has a universal invariant significance; she only transvalues it.

### Methods
#### What were the key points of this chapter?
##### Consciousness Raising

Central to Feminist methods. The key to consciousness raising is in its ways of knowing.

"What women become conscious of - the substance of radical feminist analysis - is integral to this process. Perhaps most obviously, it becomes difficult to take seriously accounts of women's roles or personal qualities based on nature or biology, except as authoritative appeals that have shaped women according to them. Combing through women's lives event by event, detail by detail, it is no mystery that women are who they are, given the way that they have been treated." (90)

"It constitutes a lived knowing of the social reality of being female ... qualities pointed to as naturally and eternally feminine ... Look simply like descriptions of the desired and required characteristics of particular occupants of women's roles." (90)

"Women's supposed power to get men to do things for them by nagging or manipulating is the other side of the power they lack to have their every need anticipated, to carry out the task themselves, to be able to deliver upon sharing the responsibility equally, or to invoke physical fear to gain compliance with their desires without even having to mention it." (94)

"The deepest paradox of consciousness raising and its most potent contribution is that it affirms that there both is and can be another reality for women by doing nothing but examining the current society's deadest ends. Effectively, the process redefines women's feelings of discontent as indigenous to their situation rather than to themselves as crazy, maladjusted, hormonally imbalanced, bitchy or ungrateful. It is validating to comprehend oneself as devalidated rather than as invalid." (100)

"Male power is a myth that makes itself true." (104).

##### Method and politics

Under the rubric of feminism, woman's situation has been explained as a consequence of biology or of reproduction and mothering, social organisations of biology as caused by the marriage law - or as an extension, as caused by the patriarchal family, becoming society as a "patriarchy." Or, it has been explained as a consequence of artificial gender roles and their attendant attitudes. Informed by these attempts, but conceiving nature, law, the family and roles as consequences, not as foundations, feminism fundamentally identifies sexuality as the primary social sphere of male power." (108-109)

Vulnerability means the appearance/reality of easy sexual access; passivity means receptivity and disabled resistance, enforced by trained physical weakness; softness means pregnability by something hard... 

"Socially, femaleness means femininity, which means attractiveness to men, which means sexual attractiveness, which means sexual availability on male terms"." (110)

"To answer an equally old question ... Feminism needs to create an entirely new account of the political world. Feminism thus stands in relation to Marxism as Marxism does to classical political economy: its final conclusion and ultimate critique. Compared with Marxism, the place of thought and things in methods and reality is reversed in a transformation and seizure of power which penetrates subject with object and theory with practice." (125)

##### Sexuality

"Male dominance is sexual." (127)

"Sexuality, in feminist light, is not a discrete sphere of interaction ... It is a pervasive dimension of social life." ... "So many distinctive features of women's status as second class ... are made into the content of sex for women. Being a thing for sexual use is fundamental to it. This approach not ust a sexuality that is shaped under conditions of gender inequality but reveals this sexuality itself to be the dynamic of the inequality of the sexes." (130)

"Force is sex, not just sexualised; force is the desire dynamic, not just a response to the desired object when desire's expression is frustrated. Pressure, gender socialisation, withholding benefits, extending indulgences, the how-to books, the sex therapy are the soft end; the fuck, the fist, the street, the chains, the poverty are the hard end. Hostility and contempt ... These are the emotions of this sexuality's excitement." (136)

"To be clear: what is sexual is what gives a man an erection. Whatever it takes to make a penis shudder and stiffen with the experience of its potency is what sexuality means culturally ... What is understood as violation, conventionally penetration and intercourse, defines the paradigmatic sexual encounter ... Male sexual desire is thereby simultaneously created and serviced, never satisfied once and for all, while male force is romanticized, even sacrilized, potentiated and naturalised, by being submerged into sex itself." (137)

"Women often find ways to resist male supremacy ... Embrace the standards of women's place in this regime as "our own" to varying degrees and in varying voices - as affirmation of identity, and right to pleasure, in order to be loved and approved and paid in order just to make it through another day." (138)

"Pornography is a means through which sexuality is socially constructed ... Constructs women as things for sexual use and constructs its consumers to desperately want women to desperately want possession and cruelty and dehumanization." (139

"From pornography one learns that forcible violation of women is the essence of sex ...  To be sexually objectified means having a social meaning imposed on your being that defines you as to be sexually used." (140)

"So long as sexual inequality remains unequal and sexual, attempts to value sexuality as women's, possessive as if women possess it, will remain part of limiting women to it, to what women are not defined as being. Outside of truly rare and contrapuntal glimpses  ... To seek an equal sexuality without political transformation is to seek equality under conditions of inequality." (154)

### The State

#### The Liberal State

"Feminism has no theory of the state ... Just as [Engels] frontally analyzed women and the state together. But just as he presumed the subordination of women in every attempt to reveal its roots, he presupposed something like the state, or statelike society, in every attempt to find its origins." (157)

"Feminism has not confronted, on its own terms, the relation between the state and society within a theory of social determination specific to sex. As a result, it lacks a jurisprudence, that is, a theory of the substance of law, its relation to society ... In absence of such answers, feminist practice has oscillated between a liberal theory of the state on the one hand and a left theory of the state on the other." (159)

"Gender is a social system that divides power." (160)

"The state is male in the feminist sense: the law sees and treats women the way men see and treat women. The liberal state coercively and authoritatively constitutes the social order in the interest of men as a gender - through its legitimating norms, forms, relation to society, and substantive policies. The state's formal norms recapitulate the male point of view on the level of design." (161-162) ... 

"The state is male jurisprudentially, meaning that it adopts the standpoint of male power on the relation between law and society ... The foundation for its neutrality is the pervasive assumption that conditions that pertain among men on the basis of gender apply to women as well - that is, the assumption that sex inequality does not really exist in society." (163)

"For women, this has meant that civil society, the domain in which women are distinctively subordinated and deprived of power, has been placed beyond reach of legal guarantees. Women are oppressed socially, prior to law, without express state acts, often in intimate contexts." (165)

"Rape law assumes that consent to sex is as real for women as it is for men. Privacy law assumes that women in private have the same privacy men do. Obscenity aw assumes that women have the access to speech men have. Equality law assumes that women are already socially equal to men. Only to the extent women have already achieved social equality does the mainstream law of equality support their inequality claims."

#### Rape: On Coercion and Consent

"If sexuality is central to women's definition and forced sex is central to sexuality, rape is indigenous, not exceptional, to women's social condition. In feminist analysis, a rape is not an isolated event or moral transgression or individual interchange gone wrong but an act of terrorism and torture within a systemic context of group subjection, like lynching." (172)

"Rape cases finding insufficient evidence of force reveal that acceptable sex, in the legal perspective, can entail a lot of force. This is both a result of the way specific facts are perceived and interpreted within the legal system and the way the injury is defined by law. The level of acceptable force is adjudicated starting just above the level by what is seen as normal male sexual behaviour ... In this context, to seek to define rape as violent not sexual is as understandable as it is futile." (173)

"Consent is supposed to be women's form of control over intercourse, different from but equal to the custom of male initiative. Man proposes, women disposes. Even the ideal it is not mutual. Apart from the disparate consequences of refusal, this model does not envision a situation the women controls being placed in, or choices she frames. Yet the consequences are attributed to her as if the sexes began at arm's length, on equal terrain, as in the contract fiction." (174)

"Virtuous women, like young girls, are unconsenting, virginal, rapeable. Unvirtuous women, like wives and prostitutes, are consenting, whores, unrapable. The age line under which girls are presumed disabled from consenting to sex ... Rationalizes a condition fo sexual coericon which women never outgrow ... The law takes the most aggravated case for female powerlessness based on gender and age combined and, by formally prohibiting all sex as rape, makes consent irrelevant on the basis of an assumption of powerlessness." (175)

"Having defined rape in male sexual terms, the law's problem, which becomes the victim's problem, is distinguishing rape from sex in specific cases. The adjudicated line between rape and intercourse commonly centers on some assessment of the women's "will"" and it really is just a reflection of what men believe rape should be (177).

"The deeper problem is that women are socialized to passive receptivity; may have or perceive no alternative to acquiescence; may prefer it to the escalated risk of injury and the humiliation of a lost fighter ... Force and desire are not mutually exclusive under male supremacy. So long as dominance is eroticized, they will never be. Some women eroticize dominance and submission; it beats feeling forced. Sexual intercourse may be deeply unwanted, the women would never have initiated it, yet no force may be present. So much force may have been used that the woman never risked saying no. Force may be used, yet the woman may prefer the sex - to avoid more force or because she, too, eroticizes dominance." (177)

"Whether the law calls this coerced consent or defense of mistaken belief in consent, hte more the sexual violation of women is routine, the more pornography exists in the world the more legitimately, the more beliefs equating sexuality with violation become reasonable, and the more honestly women can be defined in terms of their fuckability." (183)

#### Abortion: On Public and Private

"Women share isolation in the home and degradation in intimacy. The private sphere, which confines and separates women, is therefore a political sphere, a common ground of women's inequality. Rather than transcending the private as predicate to politics, feminism politicises it ... When the law of privacy restricts intrusions into intimacy, it bars changes in control over that intimacy through law. The existing distribution of power and resources within the private sphere are precisely what the law of privacy seeks to protect." (192-193)

Privacy law - so long as the public does not interfere, autonomous individuals interact freely and equally.

"Privacy law assumes women are equal to men in there. Through this perspective, the legal concept of privacy can and has shielded the place of battery, marital rape, and women's exploited domestic labour." (192-193)

"To fail to recognize the meaning of the private in the ideology and reality of women's subordination by seeking protection behind a right to that privacy is to cut women off from collective verification and state support in the same act. When women are segregated in private, separated from each other onne at a time, a right to that privacy isolates women at once from each other and from public recourse." (193-194)

#### Pornography: On Morality and Politics

"Possession and use of women through the sexualisation of intimate intrusion and access to them is a central feature of women's social definition as inferior and feminine." (195)

"Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex, a practice of sexual politics, an institution of gender inequality. In this perspective, pornography, with the rape and prostitution in which it participates, institutionalzies the sexuality of male supremacy, which fuses the erotization of dominance and submission with the social construction of male and female. Gender is sexual. Pornography constitutes the meaning of that sexuality. Men treat women as whom they see women as being. Pornography constructs who that is. Men's power over women means that the way men see women defines who women can be. Pornography is that way. In this light, obscenity law can be seen to treat morals from the male point of view, meaning the standpoint of male dominance." (197)

"The law of pornography thus has the same surface theme and the same underlying theme as pornography itself. Superficially both involve morality: rules made and transgressed for purposes of sexual arousal. Actually, both are about power: the equation between the erotic and the control of women by men, women made and transgressed for purposes of sexual arousal. It seems essential to the kick of pornography that it be to some degree against the rules but never truly unavailable or truly illegitimate. Thus obscenity law, like the law of rape, preserves both the value and the ability to get what it purports to devalue and restrict access to by prohibition." (213-214)

#### Sex Equality: On Difference and Dominance

"Law, structurally, adopts the male point of view: sexuality concerns nature not social arbitrariness, interpersonal relations not social distributions of power, the sex difference not sex discrimination." (216)

"In this view, normative equality derives from and refers to empirical equivalence. Situated difference produce differentiated outcomes without necessarily involving discrimination." (217)

"Doctrinally speaking, two alternative paths to sex equality for women exist within the mainstream approach to sex discrimination, paths that follow the lines of the sameness/difference tension. The leading one is: be the same as men." (219)

"To women who want equality yet find themselves "different," the doctrine provides an alternative route: be different from men. This equal recognition of difference is termed the special benefit rule.."  (219) "The philosophy underlying the sameness/difference approach applies liberalism to women. Sex is a natural difference, a division, a distinction, beneath which lies a stratum of human commonality, sameness." (220)

Men have become the measure of all things. "The special protection rule is the female standard. Masculinity or maleness is the referent for both. Approaching sex discrimination in this way, as if sex questions were difference questions and equality questions were sameness question, merely provides two ways for the law to hold women to a male standard and to call that sex equality." (220-221)

The law of sex discrimination seems to look ways in which that women are kept down which have not wrapped themselves up as a difference, whether original, imposed or imagined. "Consider imposed difference: what to do about the fact that women are segregated into low-paying jobs where there are no men?" (223)

"What sex equality law fails to notice is that men's difference from women are equal to women's differences from men. Yet the sexes are not equally situated in society with respect to their relative differences. Hierarchy of power produces real as well as fantasied differences, differences that are inequalities. The differences are equal. The inequalities, rather obviously, are not." (225)

"The standards of sex discrimination law are for society's exceptions. T claim that they are situated similarly to men, women must be exceptions. They must be able to claim all that sex inequality has, in general, systematically taken from women...." (228)

Social circumstances > produce distinctive interests > perceptions > meanings > definitions of rationality > challenges how neutrality is adequate to the non-neutral objectified social reality > fials to consider the power of hierarchy

Feminist issue - biology of one sex is a social disadvantage while the biology of the other is not, r is a social advantage, the sexes are equally different but not equally powerful. The issue becomes the social meaning of biology. (p. 232)

"The relevant issue is the social meaning of the sexuality and gender of women and men, not their sexuality or gender "itself" - if such a distinction can be made.. To limit efforts to end gender inequality at the point where biology or sexuality is encountered, termed differences, without realizing that these exist in law or society only in terms of their specifically sexist social meanings, amounts to conceding that gender inequality may be challenged so long as the central epistemological pillars of gender as a system of power are permitted to remain standing." (232-233)

"But under male supremacy, whil ebeing told women get it both ways - the specialness of the pedetal and an even chance at the race, the ability to be a woman adn a person, too - few women get much benefit of either. The sameness route ignroes the fact that being a woman may been seldom being a position sufficiently similar to a man ... The difference route incorporates and reflects rather than alters the substance of women's inferior status, presenting a protection racket as equal protection of the law." (233)

"The mainstream law of equality assumes that society is already fundamentally equal. It gives women legally no more than they already have socially, and little it cannot also give men. Actually doing anything for women under sex equality law is thus stigmatized as special protection or affirmative action rather than simply recognized as non-discrimination of equality for the first time. So long as sex equality is limited by sex difference - women will be born, degraded, and die." (234)

---

"Women are not permitted fully to know what sex equality would look like, because they have never lived it ... The failure to face and criticise the reality of women's condition, a failure of idealism and denial, is a failure of feminism in its liberal forms." (241)

The first step - claim women's concrete reality.
The second - recognise that male forms of power over women are affirmatively embodied as individual rights in law.

Liberal legalism - pornography is a form of freedom of speech, but women become men's speech in this system. Women's speech is silenced by pornography and the abuse that is integral to it.

The relation between life and law would also change. Law, in liberal jurisprudence, objectifies social life ... Liberal jurisprudence that the law should reflect nature or society and left jurisprudence that all law does or can do is reflect existing social relations are two guises of objectivist epistemology.
