Because of the nature of the book, notes are separated into different parts.

### CHAPTER III - Discontent and unrest
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

Partition is a cause of the awakening of India. It takes time - "when a man rises from sleep, he twists his limbs and is restless. It takes some time before he is entirely awakened." (23)

"Unrest is, in reality, discontent ... Every reform must be preceded by discontent. We throw away things we have, only when we cease to like them ... All these [unrests, death, imprisonments] may be considered good signs, but they may also lead to bad results." (23-24)

### CHAPTER IV - What is Swaraj?

What is Swaraj?

EDITOR: (In response to the READER talking about physical expulsions) "In effect it means this: that we want English rule without the Englishmen. You want the tiger's nature, but not the tiger; that is to say, you would make India English, and, when it becomes English, it would be called not Hindustan but Englishtan. This is not the Swaraj that I want." (27)

READER: "I certainly think we should copy the English people... Just as they do not allow others to obtain a footing in their country, so should we not allow them or others to obtain a footing in their country."

### CHAPTER V: The condition of England

"The best men are supposed to be elected by the people. The members serve without pay and, therefore, it must be assumed, only for the public weal ... It is generally acknowledged that the members are hypocritical and selfish." (30)

"I can have nothing against Prime Ministers, but what I have seen leads me to think that they cannot be considered really patriotic. If they are to be considered honest because they do not take what is generally known as bribery ... In order to gain their ends, they certainly bribe people with honours." (31)

### CHAPTER VI: Civilisation

What does it mean by civilisation. Why don't people debate civilisation?
EDITOR: "Those who are intoxicated by modern civilisation are not likely to write against it. Their care will be to find out facts and arguments in support of it, and this they do unconsciously, believing it to be true. A man, whilst he is dreaming, believes in his dream; he is undeceived only when he is awakened from his sleep. A man labouring under the bane of civilisation is like a dreaming man ... Their writings [on civilisation]. And so, one by one, we are drawn into the vortex." (34)

What does Gandhi think of this civilisation?
EDITOR: "Its true test lies in the fact that people living in it make bodily welfare the object of life ... The people of Europe today live in better built houses than they did a hundred years ago ... Now, one man can plough a vast tract by means of steam-engines, and can thus amass great wealth. This is called a sign of civilisation." (34-35).

EDITOR: "Now, anybody writes and prints anything he likes and poisons people's minds ... Now, thousands of workmen meet together and for the sake of maintenance work in factories or mines. Their condition is worse than that of beasts. They are obliged to work, at risk of their lives, at most dangerous occupations ... This a test of civilisation." (35)

EDITOR: "This civilisation takes note neither of morality nor of religion ... But, after twenty years' experience, I have come to the conclusion that immorality is often taught in the name of morality ... Civilisation seeks to increase bodily comforts, and it fails miserably even in doing so ... This civilisation is irreligion, and it has taken such a hold on the people in Europe that those who are in it appear to be half mad. They lack real physical strength or courage." (36). It will be self-destroyed. The English thus deserve our sympathy, they are industrious, but not bad at heart.

### CHAPTER VIII: Why was India lost?

If civilisation is a disease, and if it has attacked the English nation, why has she been able to take India, and why is she able to retain it?

EDITOR: "The causes that gave them India enable them to retain it ... The sword is entirely useless for holding India. We alone keep them ... They [English] hold whatever dominions they have for the sake of their commerce. Their army and their navy are intended to protect it ... Many problems can be solved by remembering that money is their God. Then it follows that we keep the English in India for our base self-interest. We like their commerce, they please us by their subtle methods, and get what they want from us." (40)

### CHAPTER VIII: The condition of India

The condition of India is **bad.**
We should conserve religion.

EDITOR: "If you will give the matter some thought, you will see that the terror was by no means such a mighty things ... Moreover, the present peace is only nominal, for by it we have become emasculated and cowardly ... I should prefer to be killed by the arrow of a Bhil than to seek unmanly protection ... Strength lies in absence of fear, not in the quantity of flesh and muscle we may have on our bodies ... So long as we fear our own bretheren, we are unfit to reach the goal." (43)

### Cont: railways

EDITOR: "Railway, lawyers and doctors have impoverished the country so much so that, if we do not wake up in time, we shall be ruined ... Doctors assure us that a consumptive clings to life even when he is about to die. Consumption does not produce apparent hurt - it even produces a seductive colour about a patient's face, so as to induce the belief that all is well." 

EDITOR: "It must be manifest to you that, but for the railways, the English could not have such a hold on India as they have. The railways, too, have spread the bubonic plague. Without them, the masses could not move from place to place. They are the carriers of plague germs. Formerly we had natural segregation. Railways have also increased the frequency of famines because, owing to facility of means of locomotion, people sell out their grain and it is sent to the dearest markets. People become careless and so the pressure of famine increases. Railways accentuate the evil nature of man: Bad men fulfil their evil designs with greater rapidity. The holy places of India have become unholy. Formerly, people went to these places with very great difficulty. Generally, therefore, only the real devotees visited such places. Nowadays rogues visit them in order to practise their roguery.." (46)

"It is submitted that our leading men travelled throughout India either on foot or in bullock-carts. They learned one another's languages, and there was no aloofness between them ... They, therefore, argued that it must be one nation. Arguing thus, they established holy places in various parts of India, and fired the people with an idea of nationality in a manner unknown in other parts of the world." (47)

### Cont: the Hindus and the Mahomedans

What about the inborn enmity between Hindus and Mahomedans?

EDITOR: "Pray remember this too, the Hindus flourished under Moslem sovereigns, and Moslems under the Hindu. Each party recognised that mutual fighting was suicidal, and that neither party would abandon its religion by force of arms." (51)

"Should we not remember that many Hindus and Mahomedans own the same ancestors, and the same blood runs through their veins?"

...

"But, just as I respect the cow, so do I respect my fellow-men. A man is just as useful as cow, no matter whether he be a Mahomedan or a Hindu. Am I, then, to fight with or kill a Mahomedan in order to save a cow? In doing so, I would become an enemy as well of the cow as of the Mahomedan. Therefore, the only method I know of protecting the cow is that I should approach my Mahomedan brother and urge him for the sake of the country to join me in protecting her." (52)

"If I pull one way, my Molsem brother will pull another. If put on a superior air, he will return the compliment. If I bow to him gently, he will do it much more so, and if he does not, I shall not be considered to have done wrong in having bowed ... In my opinion, cow-protection societies may be considered cow-killing societies." (53)

"If it be true that the Hindus believe in the doctrine of non-killing and the Mahomedans do not, what, I pray, is the duty of the former ... It is not written that a follower of the religion of Ahinsa ... may kill a fellow-man ... in order to save one being, he may not kill another." (53)

"These thoughts are put into our minds by selfish and false religious teachers. The English put the finishing touch. They have a habit of writing history; they pretend to study the manners and customs of all peoples." (54)

### Cont: lawyers

Men who quarrel should not go to a lawcourt.

"Lawyers have enslaved India, and they accentuated the Hindu-Mahomedan dissensions, and have confirmed English authority."

"The Hindus and the Mahomedans have quarrelled. An ordinary man will ask them to forget all about it, he will tell them that both must be more or less at fault, and will advise them no longer to quarrel. They go to lawyers. The latter's duty is to side with their clients, and to find our ways and arguments in favour of the clients to which they (the clients) are often strangers ... The lawyers, therefore, will as a rule, advance quarrels, instead of repressing them. Moreover, men take up that profession, not in order to help others out of their miseries, but to enrich themselves." (57)

"The greatest injury they have done to the country is that they have tightened the English grip." (58)

"Truly, men were less unmanly when they settled their disputes either by fighting or by asking their relatives to decide upon them. They became more unmanly and cowardly when they resorted to the court of law." (59)

### Cont: doctors

The English have used the doctors to hold us.

"Surely by our negligence or indulgence ... I over-eat, I have indigestions, I go to a doctor, he gives me medicine, I am cured, I over-eat again, and I take his pills again. Had I not taken the pills in the first instance, I would have suffered the punishment deserved by me, and I would not have over-eaten again ... I have indulged in vice, I contract a disease, a doctor cures me, the odds are that I shall repeat the vice. Had the doctor not intervened, nature would have done its work, and I would have acquired mastery over myself, would have been freed from vice, and would have become happy." (61)

"These doctors violate our religious instinct. Most of their medical preparations contain either animal fat or spirituous liquors: both of these are tabooed by Hindus and Mahomedans." (62)

///

"It is a cowardly thought, that of killing others." (75)

### CHAPTER XIII: What is true civilisation?
^e3ffce

What is civilisation?

"Civilisation is that mode of conduct which points out to man the path of duty. Performance of duty and observance of morality are convertible terms. To observe morality is to attain mastery over our mind and our passions. So doing, we know ourselves." (65) ^20e42a

"The more we indulge our passions, the more unbridled they become. Our ancestors, therefore, set a limit to our indulgences. They saw that happiness was largely a mental condition ... A man is not necessarily happy because he is rich, or unhappy because he is poor. The rich are often seen to be unhappy, the poor to be happy. Millions will always remain poor. Observing all this, our ancestors dissuaded us from luxuries and pleasures." (66)

"They therefore, after due deliberation, decided that we should only do what we could with our hands and feet. They saw that our real happiness and health consisted in a proper use of our hands and feet." (67)

Any evil of religion are defects - attempts made in spite of them.

### CHAPTER XVI: Brute Force

An argument: we are justified in gaining our end by using brute force, because the English gained theirs by using similar means.

EDITOR: "By using similar means, we can get only the same thing they got." (79). "They used the means corresponding to the end." (80)

Gandhi uses the imagery of a thief who, given kindness, "comes to learn about your loving heart ... Begs your pardon, returns you your things, and leaves off the stealing habit." (82)

"A petition of an equal is a sign of courtesy; a petition from a slave is a symbol of his slavery. A petition backed by force is a petition from an equal and, when he transmit his demand in the form of a petition, it testifies to his nobility." (83)

An argument: what of a child thrusting its foot into the fire? Assume that you must kill it to prevent it perishing from the flames or give our own life. Why is this okay?

Not the same thing: it's okay to let the child burn, using brute force against the English, you consult your own interests.

"If you say that the actions of the English, being evil, represent fire, and that they proceed to their actions through ignorance, and that, therefore, they occupy the position of a child, and that you want to protect such a child, then you will have to overtake every such evil action by whomsoever committed, and, as in the case of the child, you will have to sacrifice yourself." (85)

### CHAPTER XVII: Passive Resistance

"The fact that there are so many men still alive in the world shows that it is based not on the force of arms but on the force of truth or love. Therefore, the greatest and most unimpeachable evidence of the success of this force is to be found in the fact that, in spite of the wars of the world, it still lives on." (87)

"Thousands, indeed tens of thousands, depend for their existence on a very active working of this force. Little quarrels of millions of families in their daily lives disappear before the exercise of this force. Hundreds of nations live in peace. History does not, and cannot, take note of this fact. History is really a record of every interruption of the even working of the force of love or of the soul. Two brothers quarrel; one of them repents and reawakens the love that was lying dormant in him; the two again begin to live in peace; nobody takes note of this." (88)

"The real meaning of the statement that we are a law-abiding nation is that we are passive resisters. When we do not like Certain laws, we do not break the heads of lawgivers, but we suffer and do not submit to the laws." (89)

"Passive resistance, that is, soul-force, is matchless. It is superior to the force of arms ... But a passive resister will say he will not obey a law that is against his conscience, even though he may be blown to pieces at the mouth of a cannon." (91)

"Passive resistance is an all-sided sword; it can be used anyhow; it blesses him who uses it and him against whom it is used. Without drawing a drop of blood, it produces far-reaching results. It never rusts, and cannot be stolen. Competition between passive resisters does not exhaust. The sword of passive resistance does not require a scabbard. It is strange indeed that you should consider such a weapon to be a weapon merely of the weak." (92)

"But a passive resister has to avoid even that very limited indulgence, because he can have no desire for progeny." (96)

### CHAPTER XVIII: Education

What is the meaning of education? Is it an instrument?

EDITOR: "The ordinary meaning of education is a knowledge of letters. To teach boys reading, writing and arithmetic is called primary education ... He understands and observes the rules of morality. But he cannot write his own name. Will you add an inch to his happiness?" (99) We carried this assumption through Western thought.

What about higher education - why have we learnt geography, algebra, geometry and more? .. It does not enable us to do our duty.

"All I have shown is that we must not make of it a fetish ... In its place it can be of use, and it has its place when we have brought our senses under subjection, and put our ethics on a firm foundation ... It now follows that it is not necessary to make this education compulsory. Our ancient school system is enough." (101)

"It is worth noting that, by receiving English education, we have enslaved the nation. Hypocrisy, tyranny, etc., have increased; English-knowing Indians have not hesitated to cheat and strike terror into the people. Now, if we are doing anything for the people at all, we are paying only a portion of the debt due to them." (102)

Our religious teachers are hypocritical but we need religious education.

### CHAPTER XIX: Machinery

Machinery is awful. 

"The workers in the mills of Bombay have become slaves. The condition of the women working in the mills is shocking. When there were no mills, these women were not starving." (106)

"Impoverished India can become free, but it will be hard for an India made rich through immorality to regain its freedom. I fear we will have to admit that moneyed men support British rule; their interest is bound up with its stability. Money renders a man helpless. The other thing as harmful is sexual vice. Both are poison." (106)

However...

"We cannot condemn mill-owners; we can but pity them." (107)

"What the leaders do, the populace will gladly follow. The matter is neither complicated nor difficult. You and I shall not wait until we can carry others with us. Those will be the losers who will not do it; and those who will not do it, although they appreciate the truth, will deserve to be called cowards." (108).

Tram cars will also be gone - when there is machinery, there are large cities, tram cars and thus we must remove them to benefit the health of the people.

### CHAPTER XX: Conclusion

What to say to the English:
EDITOR : "To them I would respectfully say: ‘I admit you are my rulers. It is not necessary to debate the question whether you hold India by the sword or by my consent. I have no objection to your remaining in my country, but, although you are the rulers, you will have to remain as servants of the people. It is not we who have to do as you wish, but it is you who have to do as we wish." (111)

What of the nation?
EDITOR : "To these I would say: ‘It is only those Indians who are imbued with real love who will be able to speak to the English in the above strain without being frightened, and those only can be said to be so imbued who conscientiously believe that Indian civilisation is the best, and that European is a nine days’ wonder. Such ephemeral civilisations have often come and gone, and will continue to do so. Those only can be considered to be so imbued, who, having experienced the force of the soul within themselves, will not cower before brute force, and will not, on any account, desire to use brute force. Those only can be considered to have been so imbued who are intensely dissatisfied with the present pitiable condition, having already drunk the cup of poison." (114)

"Real home-rule is self-rule or self-control.
2. The way to it is passive resistance: that is soul-force or love-force.
3. In order to exert this force, Swadeshi in every sense is necessary.
4. What we want to do should be done, not because we object to the English or that we want to retaliate, but because it is our duty to do so.
Thus, supposing that the English remove the salt-tax, restore our money, give the highest posts to Indians, withdraw the English troops, we shall certainly not use their machine-made goods, nor use the English language, nor many of their industries. It is worth noting that these things are, in their nature, harmful; hence we do not want them. I bear no enmity towards the English, but I do towards their civilisation." (116-117)
