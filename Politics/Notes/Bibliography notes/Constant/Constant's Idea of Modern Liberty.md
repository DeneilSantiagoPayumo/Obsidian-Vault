Constant's main idea: "far from renouncing either of the the two sorts of freedom which I have described to you, it is necessary, as I have shown, to combine the two together."

Essentially, we may attach too little importance to individual rights and pleasures, that the principal danger of modern liberty derives from an undue focus on private enjoyment that leads us to "surrender our right to share in political power too easily."

This is because political liberty "is the most powerful, the most effective means of self-development that heaven has given us" - political liberty "enlarges their spirit, ennobles their thoughts, and establishes among them a kind of intellectual equality which forms the glory and power of a people."

He believed that we have reached the end of commerce, that turned slavery, war and despotism into anachronisms. Commerce not only provided for our material needs and satisfied our physical desires, but encouraged our sense of individual independence.

71

Constant is suggested to come to increasingly doubt that commerce alone could provide the glue that would hold society together - that the pursuit of self-interest would produce social atomization and disintegration, thus necessitating moral and political constraints designed to hold in and check our own destructive tendencies.

Helena Rosenblatt would argue that Constant challenges the worth of "self-interest" as a guide to our actions - finding that this will destroy men's noble sentiments and drive men to be isolated.

"When everyone is isolated, there is only dust. When the storm arrives, the dust is de la fange."
Liberty can no longer be enjoyed.

72

He distinguished between two broad moral systems: one where well-being was our goal and self-interest our guide, and other where we are driven by a sense of self-abnegation and personal sacrifice.

The latter was the essence of our religious sentiment, informing our capacity for disinterested actions but giving us a glimpse in our capacity to attain human perfection.

Our progress towards that end can never be impeded or thwarted, but it demonstrated that commerce alone was not a good enough guarantee of the existence of liberty.

Modern society faces two dangers: overpoliticization (under the French revolution) and over privatization (under Napoleon)

73

None of this diminishes the importance of Constant's basic insight: that we must never appeal to the ancients for either our model of society or understanding of freedom.

74

The principles of politics exist independently of specific constitutions. The French Revolution subverted these - that no form of sovereignty should be allowed to exercise unlimited authority. When you establish that the sovereignty of the people is unlimited, you create a degree of power that is too large.

Underpinning this are two ideas of central importance to Constant's defence of liberty - the first, that is summarised as thus:

"That society has no right to be unjust towards a single one of its members, that the society minus one is not authorized to obstruct the latter in his opinions ... save in those case where that use or that exercise would obstruct another individual possessing the same right." Governments that fail to respect this are illegitimate. This sounds like the harm principle. 

The second is the idea that individuals are the possessors of rights independently of all social and political authority - these would "consist in the option to do anything which does not hurt others ... in the right not to be obliged to profess any belief of which one is not convinced..."

75

This theory could potentially shield a minority from a majority intent on abusing its power by overstepping authority.

This was highly linked to his antipathy to [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s principle - viewing it to be not only vague, liable to contradictory application but likely to reduce morality to a matter of calculation.

76

Constant did not defend individual liberty solely by reference to right - he was sceptical of all arguments designed to justify an extension of government activity.

He questioned three propositions: first that the government was more enlightened than the governed, the idea that the mistakes of governments are less disastrous than individuals and that the harm caused by government action outweighed the good it was supposed to achieve.

So what about the proper function of government?

77

For Constant, it was only when government stepped beyond the confines of its proper sphere that it became an evil, an "incalculable harm." Within its proper sphere, government should be "all powerful" - liberty gains enormously from the fact that the government has its boundaries severely restricted, but gains nothing if it loses this.

78

The law (with some writers) is to be designed in such a way as to regulate our every movement - an inevitable slide towards tyranny. Constant suggested that this have been always the case, that "reforms that came from above were always deceptive" especially in the age of commerce where our goal was "comfort".

Legislation need have only two objectives: to prevent internal disorder and repel foreign invasion. Repression and defence were the only legitimate functions of the law. The proper functions of government were therefore, purely negative.

For Constant, war was inimical to liberty - in the age of commerce, war is an anachronism and was now shorn of the positive virtues associated with it in antiquity. The military spirit had no time for law, for discussion, for disagreement, for delay - it favoured regulation, regimentation, obedience, coercion, subordination and so on.

79

Before, the conqueror demanded only submission. Now, they required the spiritual 
mutilation and prostration of the vanquished. Masters cannot impose freedom and to do so ... was to invent a pretext for an illegitimate slavery.

These are the conditions which modern liberty could be said to flourish - where the governments keep to themselves, the state preserves its functions to those of defence and preservation of law and order and so on.

Constant's views on private property - the right to property is a social convention. Society had discovered the best way to secure quiet enjoyment of goods is recognition of the right to property.

80

Property encouraged emulation and prosperity for the division of labour.
The government should guarantee private property, and should not have much authority over inheritance - leave it alone.

81

The governed had the right to expect the government would remain true to certain principles.

This next section discusses taxation - the idea that money is best employed when it stayed in the hands of individuals. Taxation is a form of theft, perpetuated by the rich to the poor. He was a firm believer of privatization, rejecting attempts by the government to protect industry and prohibit competition - believing they caused the 'entire nation' to suffer 'a loss of freedom' and reducing individuals to the level of a 'simple machine.'

83

Constant was against artificial measures to increase population like enforcing marriage or prohibiting celibacy. For him, individual self-interest is the best means to solve that question. Constant's overall point was that the writers of the 18th century had not liberated themselves from the view that government was capable of rectifying all the ills of society.

That said he understood that he wasn't a great economist.

84

It was Constant's view that France had fallen to usurpation - that usurpation was an anachronism, not the same as despotism, not monarchy, but a novel form of government displaying its own destructive pathologies.

It was this idea of an inner sanctuary as the last bastion against oppression that informed his writings on personal freedom - his views of the freedom of expression and freedom of the press. To restrain either was to curtail our intellectual freedom - without freedom of the press, all other freedoms were illusory, the protection only being a chimera.

85

This inner sanctuary is best exemplified in his writings on religion - the guiding idea that all of our passions, religious sentiment was the most pure. But today, religion has been denatured - turned into a menacing institution.

These same principles applied equally to public education. Enlightenment shines only at the behest of freedom.

86

Do not entrust the provision of education to government - the government does not have the ability to propagate morality or so on, with education becoming the plaything of rival factions. We had to trust the good intentions of parents towards their children.

Moving from the ancient to the modern has its losses: we are incapable of lasting emotion, our enthusiasm was tempered by reflection and experience. These reformers chose to exercise public power in the manner they supposed that it had been exercised in antiquity, believing all should fall before collective authority.

87

Constant tried to sketch a form of government that is legitimate and where liberty could not be counterfeited:

At the heart of his answer that we should attack power, placing restrictions on the abuse of power, limiting sovereignty - no monarch 'possessed a power without limits', with the limitation of sovereignty put into place by a series of checks and balances.

The strength of a constitutional monarchy is separated into five branches: royal power, executive power, the power that represents permanence, the power that represents opinion and judicial power.

The biggest distinction is between royal power - divided as neutral and executive power. The royal power has a strong interest in maintaining it, is superior and an intermediate authority and so on.

Constant perceived several distinct advantages: the first being an animation of public life, the independence of the jury, the preservation of liberty through freedom of the press, that it can provide the means of reducing the role of the army to its proper one: repelling foreign invaders and 'salaried officers' that deal with internal dissent.

89

Constant made the observation: all the constitutions that had been given to France had guaranteed the liberty of the individual but all of them had violated this liberty. Declaration wasn't enough. Powerful safeguards are needed - political institutions are simply contracts and it is in the nature of contracts to establish fixed limits.
