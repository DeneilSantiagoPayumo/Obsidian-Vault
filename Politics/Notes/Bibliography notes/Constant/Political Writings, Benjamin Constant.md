The revolution of 1789 was bound to occupy all of constant's work for the rest of his life

Many economists and sociologists attempted to uncover more about the transition to the modern age. Those such as Hume and Smith were especially interested in the transition to the new age, identifying it with the growth of free market relations, the development of the division of labour and the emergence of the middling ranks and public opinion - subverting traditional beliefs and social bonds.

They expected these relations to erode human values with community life and civic virtues, and anticipated the growth of both luxury and inequality.

They believed that modern societies would be much be preferable to traditional societies - a view vastly contested by those like [[Rosseau and the Discourse on the Origin of Inequality]] who viewed the progression of civilisation the growing enslavement of mankind.

Constant was overwhelmingly convinced that the causes of the 1789 revolution were overwhelmingly political - the collapse caused by the collapse of monarchy, clergy and so on. This modern world was not compatible with enlightened despotism - but this does not mean modern society must respect free trade, no - they must acknowledge the kind of liberty characteristic of the modern condition.

In Constant's accounts, the city-states are comparatively small communities where slaves did the essential work and citizens devoted the majority of their time to military life and public services. Because of the narrow range of choices and opportunities open to each individual, and the low degree of social mobility, citizens were subject to control of the political authority and community, enjoying a greater share in public affairs but restricted in their individual choices.

In modern societies, this pattern was reversed: communities are much larger, most of the citizens devoted their energy to the production of material wealth and thus they had little opportunity to serve the state.

Living in the present is not a choice: modern society was a reality were there is no escape.

Take a look at Napoleon - who discarded the civic traditions of the ancients, buried an entire generation of Numas and Solons and committed violent warfare.

In his account of modern liberty, Constant argues that in advanced society citizens devote the majority of their time to the production of wealth, meaning that they have little participation in public life. The large size of these communities made contact between individual citizens and central authority incredibly remote.

Constant had a number of different responses to offer to the viability of the exercise of proper sovereignty (see problems above):
1. Checks and balances
2. A system of mutual trust created through rules ... rejected aristocratic liberty, modern political representation was the natural outcome of the division of labour.

In reality though, legislative engineering can never overcome the limitations of delegated power - the experience of those who governed was bound to prove significantly different than that of the ordinary citizen.

24 to 25 - benefits of modern liberty

This modern liberty gave individuals a wide range of choices and opportunities outside the narrow field of institutionalized political life.

In a society ruled by wealth, the exercise of political rights may prove without interest while their delegation may become a form of complicity in the betrayal of res publica.

The triumph of public opinion may generate the painless but formidable tyranny of the ideas recues, of widely accepted conventions and artificial opinions.

Despite that, Constant stressed that if the values of commercial society flourished in the private rather than public sphere, they need not be individualistic and instrumental. Constant rejected utilitarianism, of [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s formulation as a conflation of a rigorous theory of human behaviour and a moral doctrine - self-interest was only one feature, and Constant argues that it is quite different than Utilitarian conception within a society in which any citizen may be put to death for the sake of the public good. 

Some have coined Constant's approach as "negative liberty" - the protection of individual experiences and choices from external interferences and constraints. This is contrast to the "positive liberty" in which liberty was regarded as the product of man's active efforts to birng about an ideal

Constant was not a believer of natural rights - in any given society, people had simply those principles which were generally accepted and compatible with the conditions of society itself.

35/36 
Constant's passionate yet subtle picture of the moral and psychological ravages caused by the systematic violation of political guarantees remained unsurpassed by later writers - he showed that tyranny could be the outcome of a series of reasonable measures, instrumental considerations, short-sighted Machiavellianism, ideological fallacies.

38-39 - confronting the problem.

Constant opted for the English two chamber system for legislative power - the hereditary chamber would offer to the aristocracy of blood some real political function: its numbers, however, must not be limited.
Constant also stressed the need to establish the responsibility of ministers and the openness of all government actions.
Constant favoured direct popular election.
Constant regarded the independence of the judicial power as essential.

He insisted on the necessity of keeping alive the need for political participation, if these communities were to be protected from the dangers of destructive individualism and authoritarian ambitions. Institutions must achieve their moral education and prevent them from forgetting their stake in the fortunes of the res publica.

41 - conclusion

What is dead and alive?
It is generally taken for granted that what links him to us is liberalism - Constant used the term liberal to indicate those people who were prepared to adopt an open-minded attitude towards post-revolutionary Politics, and later used to designate members of the parliamentary at large.

His solution to his problem?
The world cannot be interpreted by appealing through systems but rather through the exercise of practical prudence and ordinary human virtues.
