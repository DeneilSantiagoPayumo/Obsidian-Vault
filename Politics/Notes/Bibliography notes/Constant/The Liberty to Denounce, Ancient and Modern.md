[[Montesquieu]] - "Political liberty in a citizen is that tranquillity of spirit which comes from the opinion each one has of his security, and in order for him to have this liberty the government must be such that one citizen cannot fear another citizen." (The Spirit of the Laws)

Political liberty is associated with a diffuse peace of mind.

But what prevents the government from misapplying public means to serve their own illicit ends?

49

Constant was deeply aware of the possibility that Government's can execute and use the authority of the state to attack other rivals.

There is no greater crime against liberty than for man to be "judged according to his secret information, transmitted, so to speak, clandestinely to his judged ... without the accused being able to refute it.""

50

The solution - high evidentiary standards - are used to prevent disinformation, malice and poisoning of the system of criminal justice.

In a [[The Leviathan|Hobbesian]] framework, state-building is understood as the replacement of horizontal threats with a single vertical threats. By drawing attention to informing, Constant scrambles this simplistic account that civil society is transformed from a dangerous into an innocent realm. Vertical states can provide additional weapon by witch private parties can pursue the destruction of enemies.

51

Greek republics want a different kind of freedom - they didn't want the attraction of freedom of modern Europe, but freedom of their own choosing - "positive liberty", with the ability to exercise directly and personally. They deliberated in the public sphere, ratified treaties of alliance with foreign powers, passed legislation and so on.

The world outside is dangerous. Because this ancient republic is small, they were driven by this common threat to protect themselves, to maintain their male citizens - they had to buy their security at price of war. The threat for them was slavery.

Constant describes ancient liberty as "an active and constant participation in collective power". Its negative dimension comes forth when it gets described as brutally real - compelling them to make warrior virtues the pinnicle of their values.


53

The liberty here is incompatible with equality - for men to be free, others had to be enslaved: a need to maintain collective readiness for war.

Active participation in decision making was a direct result of the ceaseless involvement of ancient republics in defensive and acquisitive war.

Each citizen took part in national sovereignty, but why was it "a vivid and repeated pleasure?" - he "interrogated, dismissed, condemned ... his magistrates and superiors."

The institution that expressed the total subordination of personal autonomy was ostracization - the banishment of a citizen by secret ballot.

55

Constant refers to the events of 1789 as "our happy Revolution". He praises the revolution as it resulted in the permanent dismantling of a system of great inequality.

They consumed books about reforms that could not exist in a modern country - hence the conflating of modern and ancient liberty.

Modern times are characterized by "the tendency towards equality" and revulsion against slavery. The progressive minds of antiquity though slavery was moral whereas the most reactionary minds did not believe this once.

Any attempt to resurrect ancient liberty in modern France was doomed if because ancient liberty cannot be universalized while the only liberty that can survive in the modern world must be susceptible to universalization.

57

The sensibility of modern Frenchmen had been produced by social evolution. It could not be erased or replaced by political fiat in a few short months. Desires themselves cannot be chosen.

58

According to Constant, "men invested with authority display a constant inclination to wrap themselves in mystery" - Premodern rulers used religion to bolser their legitimacy and revolutionists like the Jacobins did the same.

In some passages, Constant backed off the idea and argued the Jacobins saw the distinction but misunderstood the trade-offs - believing that the restrictions on individual rights would be amply compensated for by participation in the social power. The sacrifice of personal autonomy for a share in political power was a much better deal in a small ancient republic.

59

Modern liberty has multiple dimensions:
The first is what we call rule of law - "The right to be subjected only to the laws, and to be neither arrested, detained, put to death or maltreated in any way..." - due process of law serving the human interest in predictability and helping to foster that "peace of mind".

He ascribes modern liberty with the personal experience of security - modern citizens can be banished only according to rules that are known in advance.

In a sense, modern liberty is the antonym of ancient ostracism.

60

Modern freedom is freedom to remain a member of one's own society if so wishes. Modern freedom is the opposite of independence, freedom from expulsion and exile.

Private citizens cannot be banished but they have the right to come and go without asking for permission. This asymmetry is a feature of this freedom. Public officials have to justify their actions whereas private citizens do not.

61

The first dimension of modern liberty is the subjective certainty that one will not be punished on the arbitrary say-so of another citizen, in or out of public office - without this tranquillity of spirit, no individual will feel genuinely independent. The dependence of independence.

Second liberty - the political right to examine and criticize the government and to vote officials out of office.

```ad-important
title: The dangers of modern liberty...
"The danger of modern liberty is that, absorbed in the enjoyment of our private indepndeence, and in the pursuit of our particular interest, we should surrender our right to share in political power too easily."
```

Modern liberty hinges on the notion that the government works for the citizens. Citizens in a free state should treat public officials in the same way any principle would treat its agents - attention and severity.

"In order to judge the management of these proxies, the landowners, if they are prudent, keep themselves well-informed about affairs, the management of which they entrust to them."

Personal autonomy is unsustainable unless modern citizens exercise an active and constant surveillance over their representatives.

Modern liberty therefore is a complicated and interlocking system in which two distinct forms of freedom provide each other with support.

64

Constant suggests that people want the only kind of liberty that would make nonsense. Therefore, obey the spirit of the age!

66

People must vote.

"The share which in antiquity everyone held in national sovereignty was by no means an abstract presumption as it is in our first day. The will of each individual had real influence: the exercise of this will was a vivid and repeated pleasure."

Modern voters do not feel that they have any personal effect on the outcome of an election. They are wrong.

How does a modern tyrant persuade his salves to proclaim themselves free? - one way is to declare a psychological benefit, 
Modern denunciation is a privatized version of ostracism - the exercise of power without responsibility.

Not all modern citizens are satisfied that their sovereignty is narrowly restrained and suspended - they desire the same liberty to use public authority to injure the people that they hate.

Constant believes that political liberty is the most effective means of self development.
