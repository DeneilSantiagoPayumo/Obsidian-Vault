#### **October, 5 - 1945**
Gandhi, first letter:

I want to write about the difference in outlook between us.
"I am convinced that if India is to attain true freedom and through India the world also, then sooner or later the fact must be recognised that people will have to live in villages, not in towns, in huts, not in palaces ... I hold that without truth and non-violence there can be nothing but destruction for society ... Man should rest content with what are his real needs and become self-sufficient." (150)

**October 9, 1945**
Nehru's response:

"My view before us is not one of truth versus untruth or non-violence. One assumes as one must that true cooperation and peaceful methods must be aimed at, and a society which encourages these must be our objective. The whole question is how to achieve this society and what its contents should be ... A village, normally speaking, is backward intellectually and culturally and no progress can be made from a backward environment." (152)

What about requirements like sufficiency of food, clothing, housing, education, sanitisation which should be the minimum requirements for the country - modern means of transport must be developed. Heavy or light industries must be decentralised - available due to electric power. (152).

What about protection from foreign aggression? Let's think about scientific growth, India cannot be independent unless she is scientifically advanced.

"From the economic or political point of view an isolated India may well be a kind of vacuum which increases the acquisitive tendencies of others and thus creates conflict ... There seems to be no reasons why millions should not have comfortable up-to-date homes where they can lead lead a cultured existence." (153)

"It is 38 years since *Hind Swaraj* was written. The world has completely changed." (154)

**November 13, 1945**
Gandhi, second letter:
Gandhi attempted to write down what he understood of Nehru.

```ad-quote
title: Gandhi tries to understand Nehru, 155
1. The real question, according to you, is how to bring about man's highest intellectual, economic, political and moral development. I agree entirely. 
2. In this there should be an equal right and opportunity for all.
3. In other words, there should be equality between the town-dwellers and the villagers in the standard of food and drink, clothing and other living conditions. In order to achieve this equality today people should be able to produce for themselves the necessaries of life, i.e. clothing, foodstuffs, dwellings and lighting and water.
4. Man is not born to live in isolation but is essentially a social animal independent and interdependent. No one can or should ride on another's back. If we try to work out the necessary conditions for such a life, we are forced to the conclusion that the unit of society should be a village, or call it a small and manageable group of people who would, in the ideal, be self-sufficient (in the matter of their vital requirements) As a unit and bound together in bonds of mutual cooperation and Interdependence.
