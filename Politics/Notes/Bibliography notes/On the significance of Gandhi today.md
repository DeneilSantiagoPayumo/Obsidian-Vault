# The Power of Integral Nonviolence: On the Significance of Gandhi Today
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
This text transcribes and revises a lecture given at a workshop on the significance of Gandhi today.
```

I focus on three interconnected arguments that Gandhi put together and tested in practice throughout his adult life. Moreover, I present these arguments in the way that Richard Bartlett Gregg (1885-1974) explicated and developed them in his many writings from 1928 to 1969. Gregg knew Gandhi better than any other North American. 

The three arguments - his critique of the deep problems of Western Industrial civilisation or modernization. The second - the deep problem of Western modernization. Third, the nonviolent ways of life that has the capacity to transform modern social systems of inequality.

These arguments are strongly interconnected. It is brought into being, time and time again. Between him and [[Gregg]] 's arguments is a contrast between two general modes of power that have many specific manifestations in different relationships and circumstances. These two modes of power are '*himsa*' the power of violence, domination and exploitation and *'ahimsa*', the power of nonviolence, non-domination.

The power of _ahimsa_ (nonviolence) – power-with – is manifest first and foremost in the nonviolent ethics or ethos that Gandhi calls satyagraha. This nonviolent ethical mode of being is then manifest in various nonviolent ways of being-in-the-world-with-others (human and non- human). The three most important are:

(1) _swaraj_: individual and collective self-organising and self-governing participatory democracy;

(2) _swadeshi_: community-based and democratically organised ecological or cyclical economics; and

(3) nonviolent direct interaction and contestation with violent and dominative others, oriented towards showing violent contestants the superiority of nonviolent ways of conflict resolution, and so of transforming the contest into nonviolent contestation, negotiation, resolution and, eventually, cooperation together.

As we can see, these ways of being nonviolent are both means and ends

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Two modes of power - nonviolence and violence - and their various forms

At the heart of Gandhi's analysis a contrast between two general modes pf power - the power of violence, domination and exploitation, and the por of nonviolence, non-domination and non-exploitation.

16 - It is the power that animates and connects all forms of life in infinitely complex relationships of interdependency, symbiosis, mutual aid and nonviolent dispute resolution without which life would not exist and evolve.

17 - The recourse to violence ... Is the specific manifestation of the general mode of power that runs throughout modern societies. Violence is not only used to impose coercive relationships of power-over others. It requires relationships and ever more extensive military-industrial-economic complexes of command - obedience and ruler-ruled in order to mobilise for the next cycle of violence and counter-violence. And these dominant relationships have social-cultural blowback effects on all social relationships. Violent conflicts becomes the prototype for nonviolent forms of competition and conflict resolution in the political, economic and social spheres.

When this happens, we turn to this mode of power and foreground it in history, political theories, social sciences and media. We take it to be the model of all forms of human power. In doing so, we overlook another mode of power - the power of nonviolent cooperation.

### Contrasting assumptions

20 - Gandhi argues that violent and nonviolent social systems are based on contrasting assumptions. The power of nonviolence is based on the assumption of a spiritual or animating unity of life in relationships of interdependency and mutual aid that is more fundamental than our differences.

22 - In contrast, the basic assumption of the power of violence is that humans are separate or independent beings. As a result, distrust is prior to trust, ill-will is prior to good-will, anti-social behaviour is prior to coercively imposed socialisation.

23 - in addition, these two ways of life have diametrically opposed assumptions about the relations between means and ends ... (next, paraphrased) the power of nonviolence = means give rise to the ends. (end) It follows that the only way to a nonviolent world is by nonviolent means in each step we take.

24 - Violent victory over an opponent suppresses the conflict but does not resolve it, feeding resentment and retaliation.

25 - The objective of nonviolent resistance, therefore, is not victory over an opponent, voluntary submission or even compromise. Rather, the aim is to transform the violent adversary into a nonviolent partner in a nonviolent relationship of exercising power together.

26 - the power of violence, in contrast, rests on the assumption that means are contingently related to ends. Vicious or immoral means can lead to virtuous or moral ends.

### Satyagraha 1: ethics or ethos

This is a brief sketch of Gandhi's views of how the enactment and coordination of nonviolent ethics, community-based participatory democracy, cyclical economics and nonviolent agnostics can change and gradually transform our violent world into one in which nonviolence is paramount.

Satyagraha in the specific sense of individual ethics or ethos in the first step.

29 - Gandhian ethics consists, first, in always being truthful and open; of always seeking the truth and acting accordingly in everything we say and do. We need to realise that we are less than perfect in searching for the truth and acting on it; we may always be mistaken and we always see the truth partially or perspectivally in our time and place. Thus, we need to see each attempt as an experiment; and always be open to criticism and self-criticism.

30 - There is a more general and primary sense of 'truth' involved here; namely 'the truth of our being' - the ground of our being is in relationships of mutual love. We are all connected with and animated by this nonviolent power. Nonviolence refers here to nonviolence in both the negative sense of non-harm, or minimum harm, to all living beings, and the positive sense of active care or compassion for all living beings.

31 - the first step is to work to free ourselves from socialisation into the dispositions to act in accordance with power of violence, domination and exploitation.

32 - the second set of practices of the self is to begin to act in all your relationships to yourself, to others, to the living earth and to the spiritual realm in the way of non-harm and compassion with an open heart; even in relation to those who are portrayed as your enemies..

33 - this leads eventually to the famous third step of spiritual ethics. Rather than struggling against the grain of your socialisation to try to grasp and hold onto the truth of your being in nonviolence, you begin to connect  with the intersubjective power or animacy of nonviolence, and it begins to support your efforts ... Ethical conduct becomes more regular, customary and graceful as the ethical agent becomes infused with the power of love that animates all life.

34 - this third step of the universal power of love supporting and moving the honest ethical apprentice for Gandhi and King is a common feature of many ethical traditions.

35 ... It is also that the world is disclosed to us in a new way in virtue of our new way of being ... We see that our life is co-sustained by all the forms of life around us on which we depend, and which depend on us in turn. We recognize this truth in every breath we take of clean air, every step we take on the living earth, every morsel of food we eat...

### Satyagraha 2-3:  *swaraj* and *swadeshi*

36 - According to Richard Gregg, Gandhi's great insight was to see that bringing this nonviolent ethos into being and sustaining it over time had to be grounded in apprenticeship in nonviolent communities of practice with like-minded others. These are communities of practice organised around participatory democracy, the shared exercise of power-with each other, and the settlement of disputes nonviolently: that is, collective self-government or _swaraj_. Moreover, they are also communities of self-reliant, cyclical economics, human-scale technology, voluntary simplicity, non-possession, renewable energy sources and solar power, and care for the ecosystems that sustain their pacific way of life: that is, ecosocial self-reliance or _swadeshi_. Community members cultivate Gandhi’s alternative modernity from the ground-up and they network outwards to other similar communities around the country and the world. These communities embody Gandhi’s main norm of human association: the sustaining and well-being of each and all affected, human and non-human: that is, _sarvodaya_

### _Satyagraha_ 4: nonviolent agonistics

38 - this cultivation of nonviolent ethics in nonviolent communities of practice, including the nonviolent use of renewable resources, is the foundation of Gandhi's alternative modernity, and of his way of spreading it non-violently around the world.

39 - The practitioners of nonviolent agonistics first learn the alternative way of life they are contesting for through living in these communities of practice. They also learn the _way_ that they should conduct themselves in contestation with violent and dominative opponents if they are to embody the power of nonviolence as Gandhi understands it.

40 - We can see that there is a circular relationship of mutual support of the four components of Gandhi’s alternative modernity. In order to be able to govern non-violently with-others in democratic communities of self-government, local economics and agonistic campaigns of non-cooperation, participants have to engage in ethical practices of individual self-government. Reciprocally, to develop individual ethical self-government, they have to practice it in the complex cooperative and conflictual relationships of collective self-government in these communities of practice. They are all instances of ‘self-government’.


```ad-quote

The central point of Gandhian agonistics is that it is the manifestation and dramatization of the moral-psychological power of the nonviolent way of life and of the way disputes are resolved in and by it. It works by _persuading_ the violent opponent and onlookers of its superiority; by drawing the other into its nonviolent relationships of mutual trust; and thereby gradually transforming the violent other into a nonviolent democratic partner.

Violent actors act on the assumption that nonviolent actors will respond with fear or anger and thus respond with flight or fight. They expect this kind of interaction and know it well through training and experience. But, this is not what happens. Instead, nonviolent practitioners embody and manifest all the virtues of Gandhi’s ethics. They are fearless, calm, and steady because of training, belief and experience. They exhibit self-control and do not retaliate with anger and counter-violence. They accept blows with a good temper, state their desire to find out the truth of the dispute and to examine both sides, and to abide by the outcome. They harbour no ill-will, treat the other as a friend, not an enemy, and assume good faith. They prove their sincerity by accepting suffering rather than inflicting it on others, with no fear or resentment. They manifest an outstanding kind of courage that violent attackers have not seen before: the courage to die but never to kill. (The power of nonviolence is the weapon of the strong, not of the weak.)
```

### Integration 

Once violent opponents realise that the nonviolent actors do not wish to humiliate or conquer, but to work out their dispute in a relationship of mutual respect, the violent opponents see there is a way to re-establish their equilibrium at a higher level of existence.

This has three features:

```ad-quote
title: 52
The first is Gregg’s view that the transformation of the contest between nonviolent and violent actors into nonviolent negotiation is what he calls the ‘sublimation’ and the ‘inclusive syntheses’ of the energy of both parties. In violent versus nonviolent struggles the partners use their energy in opposition to each other. Not as much energy is wasted as in violent struggles, but it is still immensely wasteful, enervating and exhausting, especially for the violent partners.
```

```ad-quote
title: 54
The second point Gandhi and Gregg make is that this kind of negotiation or integration requires ‘love’ in the sense of empathy and compassion of each participant in dialogue-with each other if they are to really understand the suffering of each and work out the appropriate ways to well-being in mutual response. It cannot be a pre-packaged model of transitional justice from dictatorship to representative democracy, for this is just the exercise of domination (power-over) of the more powerful partners in a new form.

```

## Cycles of learning and persuasion

```ad-quote
title: 55
The third point is that this way of negotiation is itself a manifestation of a nonviolent way of life – of ongoing nonviolent contestation and cooperation. In engaging in it, the participants are beginning to bring into being a nonviolent way of life together and be animated by the symbiotic power that co-sustains all life. The negotiations are not episodic and final, but, rather, ongoing and cumulative.
```

```ad-quote
title: 56
The partners often call off the negotiations when they appear to be blocked or a compromise has been achieved. The nonviolent partners return to their communities of social, spiritual and ecological practices to reconnect with the restorative and animating power of nonviolence these provide (even in prison). Here they reflect on the integrative negotiations, the contests that preceded the negotiation, and the complex effects and responses these had on participants, onlookers and the global audience _as_ ‘experiments in truth’.

```

```ad-quote
title: 57
Gandhi’s famous Salt March campaign in 1930, the negotiations that followed, and Gandhi’s decision to call off the negotiations at a certain point is often taken as the paradigm case of this virtuous, cyclical nature of nonviolent agonistics. This is true, yet Gregg also puts this famous example in the broader context of Gandhi’s life, the cyclical character of nonviolent campaigns grounded in the broader nonviolent way of life of communities of practice, and the ongoing interactions with the violent way of life it works to transform. As Gregg learned in Gandhi’s Sabarmati ashram, this is how the power and animacy of nonviolence cooperation and contestation grow in both the human and natural world – ‘slowly but surely’, step by step, and generation by generation. That is, not by force, but by the transformative power of ‘persuasion’
