For Weber, man's fate is to be a political animal but politics does not and cannot offer a road to happiness, justice, perpetual peace or redemption.

GPS: "Anyone who goes in for worldly politics must, above all, be free of illusions and acknowledge one fundamental fact: to be resigned to the inevitable and eternal struggle of man with man on this earth."

### The concept of the political

84-5 Politics, for Weber means, "Striving for a share of power or for influence on the distribution of power, whether it be between states or between groups of people contained within a single state."

"If one says that a question is a ``political'' question, or that a minister or offcial is a ``political'' official, or that a decision is determined ``politically,'' what is meant in each case is that interests in the distribution, preservation, or transfer of power plays a decisive role in answering that question, determining this decision or defining the sphere of activity of the official in question. Anyone engaged in politics is striving for power, either power as a means to attain other goals (which maybe ideal or selfish), or power ``for its own sake,'' which is to say, in order to enjoythe feeling of prestige given bypower. "

Weber asserts that neither set of relationships (social relationships and associations) is reducible to the other: although politics takes place within a social and cultural context it must be understood in terms of its autonomy. Civil society is the arena for the conflict of ideal as well as material interests.

Weber describes the modern state as being nothing other than an "enterprise" or a "business", disenchanted - the "modern state is an organization (Betrieb) in exactly the same way as a factory; indeed that is its specific historical characteristic" (PW 146)".

The ubiquity and intensity of conflicts of value are a consequence of disenchantment and the loss of the Christian ethic.

86 He was sceptical of all attempts to attain a permanent harmony of values either by means of the construction of a "moral science" or by means of "political practice" - inseparable from his theory of value. 

### Rule and legitimation

"Herrschaft" - translated as domination, rule, authority, leadership and a variety of more. It is unclear of what it truly means.

One obstacle has been the reception of his work - most social science works with a misleading account of Weber's intentions, or 'value-free'

87 Rather, he used Herrschaft in a particular matter - he is not value-free, the discussion of the basic forms of political and social association is in itself an expression of a political position, this "determined realism" an aim at the "state metaphysics" of von Gierke.

Discussions of "legitimate order" and "struggle" occupy a strategic position - concept of "legitimacy" refers to an acceptance of the validity of an order of rules, that is to say the question of belief which justify acceptance, not the question of whether that body of rules should be considered legitimate.

88 No regime can survive for long if based on force alone. All rulers must strive to obtain legitimacy - legitimacy is, in effect, defined in terms of legality.

Some difficulties with notions of neutrality become apparent: Weber was influenced strongly with Nietzschean scepticism - if one accepts that no appeal to a transcendent standard for judging the legitimacy of regimes was credible, how can modern regimes legitimate themselves or be held to be legitimate?

89 Weber distinguishes between power (macht) and rule (herrschaft) - he defines power as "every chance of imposing one's own will within a social relation, even against resistance, regardless of what this chance is based upon." Rule is defined as "the chance of having an order with a specific content obeyed by specifiable persons."

Weber contrasts "rule" in an economic context from "rule" in a political context - the purest form of the former is a monopolistic control of a market whereas the purest form of the latter is provided by the rule of a prince or Patriarch - the concept of rule is to be used in the narrow sense to refer to powers to command and not to all kinds of control including those forms which emerge from market-based economic exchange.

An association of rule is a political organisation if its order and existence take place within a particular territory and this order is backed by the threat and application ... of the use of physical force - a state is that particular kind of political organisation is able to maintain a monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force and violence.

Territoriality is important, stressed in his discussion of political communities - a political community is to be distinguished from any kind of economically structured social grouping in that the "specific pathos" of a "political community" produces among its members a "community of political destiny" - experiences of common struggle producing deep feelings of a shared fate which can transcend other social and cultural ties.

89-90 The state is to be identified with those means rather than the ends which are peculiar to it. The essential characteristic of political rule is therefore that it is that form of rule which is supported by the use of or threat to make use of physical force.

### Rule and Legitimacy

For Weber, the stability of any form of rule depends on the requirement that those who are ruled accept or submit to the authority of those who rule.

He adapted Jellinek's empirical types to create his 'ideal type' of legitimacy.

He takes it as a basic social fact that inequality in the distribution of power and any form of rule will need to justify itself.

91 During periods where inequalities of social existence become visible, masses will stop being idle, and result in violent struggles.

Legitimate rule can be described in three forms:
1. The authority of the eternal past of **custom** hallowed by the fact that it has held sway from time. This is **traditional rule**.
2. The **gift of grace** from Charisma, legitimacy arising from trust pf a character. this is **charismatic rule**.
3. There is rule by virtue of legality, in the belief of legal statute, noted to be **rational rule**

He was plainly interested in charismatic rule.

The order in which Weber presented these ideas was meant to discourage any interpretation which sees them as constituting an evolutionary progression.

In *Economy and Society* he discusses rational, legal rule with a bureaucratic staff first, followed by traditional rule, and then charismatic rule.

92 All forms of rule are combined with specific forms of administration - a bureaucratic form of administration, contained in the idea that legitimacy is derived from acceptance of the authority of a system of abstract rules. The administration of law consists in applications of these rules to particular cases. The institutional structure which is most formally rational rests primarily on this type of legitimacy.

Bureaucratic administration is hierarchal - we've got officials, proletariat and so on.

Weber wants to discuss its implications.
The real problem of bureaucracy is in Weber's view in the tendency of bureaucracy to extend its role beyond its legitimate province and to transform what Weber considered to be the genuine politics of leadership into routine administration.

In a modern state where strong political leadership is lacking, the probability is that higher ranking officials are likely to with their battles with nominal superiors because of their possession of the specialist knowledge which bureaucracy contains.

The rule of law operates as a fa√ßade covering the reality of the relations of power and rule which are the foundation of all political regimes.

93 The superiority of bureaucracy guarantees its progressive development ... common to both socialist and capitalist economies - as far as he was concerned a socialist economy was likely to be subject to bureaucracy than a capitalist one.

The tensions between formal and substantive rationality is built into the operation of all forms of modern bureaucracy - the extension of bureaucratic rule under conditions of socialism is an important example of this conflict between formal and substantive rationality.

Rather, Weber meant the substantive aims and ideals of socialism (equality, community, distributive justice) versus the formal, hierarchical character of bureaucracy whose ability to produce formal rationality and economic calculability is indispensable for its survival.

This has several implications: a tendency towards social levelling, 'plutocratization' based on time requried to gain technical training.

The spirit of bureaucracy, with its levelling tendencies and undermining of traditional privileges of status, possesses an "elective affinity" with the culture of "mass democracy." - observed in the bureaucratization of political parties.

Democratic parties cease to rely on leadership and have become bureaucratically organized under the leadership of party officials.

There is no sense that the mass can govern the state. Formal democratization does not produce change in how masses are ruled. Democracy is simply a mechanism whereby leaders are selected.

93-94 The growth of bureaucracy is due to the unintended consequence of the democratic struggle against rule by notables while the democratic principle requires that the power of administrators be curbed.

Modern mass democracy cannot function without bureaucracy. Democracy is understood not in the sense of direct democracy, but as the rule of elected party leaders.

The indispensability of bureaucracy has an implication: genuine revolutions are increasingly unlikely to be successful in modern states.

Legal rule supplanted traditional forms of rule in western states, legitimised by beliefs in social order. In contrast with bureaucratic rule, rule that appeals to tradition produces regimes of personal loyalty - see patriarchal rule.

Weber believes in the never-ending struggle of charisma against the routinizing forces of bureaucratization and routinization - Charisma is the 'gift of grace', the 'quality of a personality.'

95 Underlying all of his thought is the problem of the human being under conditions of rationalization and disenchantment - Weber reveals his standpoint.

There is the question of which type of human being will dominate: the cultured man or the expert specialist, the technician.

The consequence is how this treats democracy. There is no form of democratic legitimation and does not fit easily - it takes the form of plebiscitary democracy which is a version of charismatic Leadership Democracy - only formally derived from the will of a ruled, rules on the basis of devotion and trust of his followers.

Modern mass democracies are simply thus - legitimacy resides simply in their ability to maintain the support of his follower. There is no appeal to any other standard of legitimacy. This concentration on relations of rule creates a tension - despite his insistence for 'politically responsible' citizen, Weber was unable to uncover significance on public debate and deliberation.

96 One central problem - Greek polis was neither a traditional or rational form, so ideally should be an example of plebiscitarian democracy, charismatic.

He characterizes life in here in terms of a competition between demagogues resting on emotional appeal - disregarding notions of political community constituted on the basis of citizenship.

This is weak - dismissing them as irrational does not advance our understanding.

## Politics and legitimation in a disenchanted world.

Weber's account can be understood in terms of his interpretation of the fundamental problem created by the inevitable tension between the universal operation of power and its need for the ruler *and* ruled.

97 The defining problem of modernity is its relentless advance of the forces of rationalization and disenchantment which can undermine ideas we have relied on for so long to provide the grounds for our ideas of legiitmacy.

For Wilhelm Hennis, the fundamental issue that runs is a concern with the relationship between forms of Lebensfuhrung, the ways in which men attempt to give meaning to their existence, and the constraints imposed by the logic of power, politics and 'rule of man over man.'

The historical uniqueness of the western society and state can be understood as disenchantment - while our culture is being radically transformed by these forces, the reality of power and rule of man over man will always be a central question.

One consequence is that the undermining of our sense that our important values are supported while our appreciation of the reality of plural, conflicting values are heightened.

98 The idea is a fundamental conflict of values ... central for an understanding of Weber's political force.

Can there be a similarity to Machiavelli?

They both share a belief in the autonomy of the political domain, that they are characterised by their own logic.

In short for Weber, all political life is centred around power: politics is struggle, requires leaders, requires leaders guided by responsibility, requires a following, yet is constrained by the modern organizational world.

"All politics is violence - even, in its own fashion, democratic politics."

It is our common fate to be condemned to live in and to try and make sense of a world where the "rule of man over man" is an inevitable reality.
