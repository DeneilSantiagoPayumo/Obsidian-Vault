[[Weber, P and V of Politics Set Text]]
This passage has some mild asides to [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]]

## THE DILEMMA OF DIRTY HANDS

A questions Hobbes did not answer - what is it like to *be* the sovereign?

Hobbes, as you know, identified one answer on how threats of violence makes things better.

Machiavelli had another: the unscrupulous and devious pursuit of power for its own sake - the term later to be known as ''[[Realpolitik]]'', the idea that a political act is justified if it works to the advantage of the person who performs it.

Machiavellian is a caricature of Machiavelli - a moralist.
He satirized the idea of Christian virtue and the assumption that rulers should be in the business of justifying their rule in the eyes of God - he saw the problem from the people doing duling.

For him, the job of ruling was to maintain your estate - preserve intact the domain over which your power runs. The reward was not just survival but also glory.

36 A ruler must use his power to preserve it: divide his enemies, lie and so on. It is better to be feared than to be loved.

He calls this behaviour virtuous, good by political standards. This is the idea that politics has its own code of conduct that is separate from conventional morality, a separate sphere of life rather than an exemplification of how to live.

It was written for the precarious world of early sixteenth-century Italian politics, where a knife in the back ... was never far away.

Machiavellianism is not hard to find, but he is a resoundly pre-modern thinker. The first line remarks to:

```ad-quote
title: First line of The Prince
collapse: closed
"ALL STATES, all powers that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities."
```

Machiavelli still belongs to the either/or world where politics is either kingly politics or citizen politics - where power resides either in a set of hands or in many hands. *The Discourses* spells out that if citizens want to maintain their power, they will have to use it against their enemies ... but Machiavelli would never have thought that a republic and a principality should be confused with each other.

Am I in a republic in a principality? Hobbes would remove the distinction. The US appears to be a prince in its president but has a princely court. Obama is not really a prince because his power is circumscribed by popular politics.

Modern politics combines extraordinary personal power with the impersonal institutional apparatus of a state - a distinctive moral and psychological dynamic best described as Weberian. As we know, he describes a monopoly which "claims a monopoly of the legitimate use of violence".

What Weber saw is that the existence of these entities changes the character of political violence - they don't abolish it, but rather institutionalise, rationalise and bureaucratise it. Successful states, in controlling violence, build up a network of institutions whose job is to manage it. Politicians find themselves surrounded by civil servants ... but are still only the people who can declare war on external enemies [and] are the only people who can call in the police on internal ones.

His fear was that this would encourage politicians to be irresponsible in their use of violence.

1. One form of irresponsibility is to shy away from violence in the hope that politics can do without it.

Weber was adamant that both saints and bureaucrats would make bad politicians - that professions that make the best politicians are lawyers and journalists since their members are used to twisting the rules to suit their own purposes.

2. The other form of irresponsibility is to over-indulge in violence, on the grounds that the politician is not performing the violence themself.

It is being done in the name of the state. Politicians who think like this end up wallowing in violence as they personally don't have to see through the consequences.

This is the dilemma of 'dirty hands' - politics is impossible if you aren't willing to get your hands dirty, but if you think that politics justifies whatever dirt you pick up, then you're liable to end up elbow-deep in blood.

How to avoid this? Weber has no solution, except to that politicians have to hold themselves responsible for their dirty deeds. He thought that everyone should be alive to ethical difficulties.

This is dealing with the devil - the personal strain of holding yourself together might make us mad.

He wrote in a time of crisis - past the first world war, Germany stood on the brink of civil war. We have Bolshevik revolutionaries on the left, and proto-fascist paramilitaries on the right glorifying violence as a force of good. These wannabee politicians were self-deluded, and he was afraid the Weimar Republic would be too squeamish in dealing with them.

In the short run, his fears was overblown. In the long run, German democracy did not know how to defend itself. That said, contemporary democracies are far removed from his time.

But this dilemma has not gone away. Even law-abiding politicians still find themselves doing horrible things: for instance Obama has ramped up the use of drone warfare in response to the threat terrorism poses. Drones kill, can be targeted at bad guys, but collateral damage is unavoidable.

Politicians who don't use drones as people would die would be irresponsible, but that doesn't justify in itself the use of drones.

This violence is sanitised, tempting politicians into thinking that they have chosen the safe option. It can be rationalised, an immense calculus of lives - encouraging a bureaucratic mindset to take hold of political judgement. There is so much to consider than its cost-effective mindset: from America's long-term reputation, to resentments that build up over time, to even America's allies.

What does it can to take responsibility? Is feeling bad enough? Weber warns that feeling that it is inevitable can become its own excuse for political irresponsibility.

It's not good enough. It's not just the politician's call. Weber was enamoured with the idea of the solitary hero when politics was tragic, but in the early 21st century the balance of risk has changed - there are threats to the shared principles of political conduct, and responsibilities to constitutional properties, to international law, to global public opinion. Something must hold them to account.
