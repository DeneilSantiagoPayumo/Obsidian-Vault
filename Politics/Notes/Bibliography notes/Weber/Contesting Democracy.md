CONTESTING DEMOCRACY POLITICAL IDEAS IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY EUROPE
JAN-WERNER MULLER
[[Weber, Profession and Vocation of Politics]]

## The Molten Mass

7

The introduction is at this: at 1918, Weber had recently returned from Berlin to Munich, only to find himself in the midst of a 'bloody carnival.' In the capital he had played a prominent role in deliberations about a new German constitution.

8

He ... tried desperately to act as a political educator of the German nation. he had also hoped to stand for ... parliament. But it was clear now that the liberal party with which he had associated himself would nominate more professional politicians and not someone widely considered an irascible academic.

He had a contempt for a character like Eisner: in Weber's estimation the man was a litterateur dabbling in politics, a demagogue in love with his own rhetoric, but also the victim of a very short-term success.

Weber held that there were three bases of legitimating rule: there was tradition, where men and women obeyed on the basis of precedent; there were formal legal procedures, so that
the law was judged to be legitimate if it had passed through the correct channels .... and, finally, there was personal charisma which had an affinity with revolutionary politics.

According to Weber, it could be applied generally to leaders who seemed to have been graced with special gifts and who therefore inspired fervent devotion and deep trust among their followers.

9

Weber's question: what is politics as a profession or a vocation.

The question was how possible were responsible political action and stable liberal regimes in what Weber called a disenchanted world, a world in which religion, metaphysics and other sources of meaning ... seemed all to have been placed in doubt.

Weber was convinced that traditional legitimacy was disappearing ... that Europeans had entered the democratic age for good.

The charisma of monarchs ... had been dispelled by the disasters of a war during which monarchs had generally revealed themselves as incompetent.

Weber was sure that democracy could only be realized within homogenous nation state ... disenchantment and democracy went together' they were both peculiar to the path of development that the West had taken.

## The Age of Security (for Some)

Weber had been shaped by the high tide of nineteenth-century liberalism, and what the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig in retrospect called "the golden Age of Security."

10

Zweig remembered that in those pre-war years "everything radical, everything violent seemed impossible in an age of reason."

This age of reason and security rested on three central ideas ... security had meant ... the absence of war and other large-scale violence. Fewer Europeans died in combat in the nineteenth century than in the eighteenth; and the period 1871 to 1914 proved to be the longest stretch to intra-European peace up to that point in history (the most obvious exception, when the rest of the globe is taken into account, was Great Britain - which was almost always at war somewhere).

Security ... seemed to be connected to the increasing interdependence of European states and empires through the circulation of money, goods - and people. The decades before [WW1] saw what has sometimes been called a "first wave of globalisation" - a golden age of internationalism in the sense of free trade, international co-operation in setting standards and pooling sovereignty for economic benefits.

There was also a sense .. of freedom of movement and consequently large waves of migration.

Travel seemed easy ... only Turkey and Russia had passport controls, and they regulated internal movements only.

Freedom of movement was just one aspect of a general liberal belief in increasing liberty for everyone, especially if that term primarily meant 'freedom from the state.'

11

The freedom for things and people to move across borders and the self-determination of societies were not seen by European liberals as incompatible ... there existed a by and large unbroken belief in progress.

But 'collective self-determination' had a very limited meaning: the state ... was to be at the service of society; and society in turn could best express what is needed and wanted in parliaments run by gentlemen with a sense of the common good: the Age of Security was also the Age of Parliamentarism.

Only those parts of society could express themselves which actually had the vote.

Liberals assumed that over time more and more people would qualify for it through education and property; those without either could not be trusted with choosing governments.

But not everybody wanted to wait.

Women demanded the vote ... the vote was to be uncoupled from income; an officially unequal power distribution like Prussia's three-tier system.

Ethnic groups wanted their say.

12

Ruling elites with heredity political privileges came under attack.

Both liberal and conservative elites thought they could master what increasingly looked like a comprehensive crisis in representation.

In practice, extending the franchise and empowering parliaments did not proceed in a neat parallel ... while legislatures in general were becoming more effective in controlling executives, they were not necessarily populated by ever more specialized politicians.

There was a third intuition: ... belief in the eventual Europeanization of the world, in the sense of European dominance of the world and global acceptance of Europe's civilization as a model.

13

Whatever particular political challenges ... it seemed they could be contained in a Europe understood as a secure order built on nation-states.

However... it was great, rival empires which were the most obvious feature of the world scene at the beginning of the century.

An impartial observer might have concluded that two types of empire were competing.

14

On one hand, ... old established nation states with vast colonial overseas venture

On the other hand, continental, large land masses.

(Paraphrased)

Competition played out in Europe: Germany called itself an empire, its unification in 1871 based on nationalist principles.

It had unified in a somewhat imperial manner by Prussia, had fuzzy frontiers, lots of ethnic minorities.

Acted simultaneously like a continental empire, state with colonialist ambitions. Weltpolitik served Innenpolitik in a polity that was powerful enough to dominate and yet not so.

Another European commonality: legitimacy of monarchy - Queen Victoria died, funeral attended by emperors and sovereigns.

Personal qualities mattered little - what did (to Weber) was "the charisma of blood" they had inherited and pass to children.

Thus, bureaucracies ruled, not royals.

The obvious way despite that of organizing politics appeared to be monarchy: 1912, Albania - German prince.

Dominance of monarchy as legitimacy made stability and security.

Empire, there were two types of monarchy:
* Parlimentary monarchies that took their distance from doctrines of the divine right, conscious of how to best appeal to people, through modern public relations, legitimacy wass based on monarchy's usefulness for keeping together the nation or the empire. This showed their diminishing influence.
* Monarchs who believed in divine right and constitutions to be nothing but pieces of paper - pagentry are symbolic weapons, states and empires their possessions.

## Goodbye to Most of That

Then WW1 came and it swept away the empires of Germany, Habsburg, the Russian and the Ottoman.

17

Habsburg empire - rivalries of nationalities had been held in check by Reich patriotism, peace time kept everything stable - the war revealed that the empire had little reason for existence or economic benefits.

End of war, monarchs were losing aura, dominated by their own politicians.

Nicholas II abdicated in favour of his brother Michael - violation of law of succession proved the throne was private possession, not impersonal office with objective duties.

18

Charisma had to keep proving itself but it could not.

European order shaken, hierarchies more-so. Aristocrats, definitely.

Republics became the rule. Many drafters wanted to stabilize states.

19

State merged with economy:
* industrial production concentrated, co-ordinated by ministries
* Labour took part in comprehensive planning
* Negotiations between capital and labour institutionalized
* Organized capitalism

State power not feared as restricting freedom of individuals - social and political possibility.

Rather than the educated parts of society articulating their interests, the idea gained ground that state could be harnessed by society to transform itself.

20

Also, women became able to work (1918) Britain, universal manhood suffrage

Liberals failed in their attempt to create a new form of statecraft lamenting the rise of the masses,

Mass man was characterized by what he lacks: qualities of rationality and self-restraint. Worryingly, he had the levers oof modern technology. Liberalism revealed itself as a quasi-aristocratic approach to Politics that could not cope with mass democracy.

It was a fact that tons of new classes and groups entered politics - in Central and Eastern Europe, the peasantry.

Of course, they were very prejudiced against the peasants - only Czechoslovakia could integrate them.

New groups wanted more.

## Liberal Revolutions without Liberals

Idea of national unity across class lines -> claims for democracy, helped demands to succeed.

Nationalism did not neatly map on to existing states.

Post-war period saw triumph of principle of self-determination. 

Woodrow Wilson 14 points, revolution - organizing states. These new norms of  national self-determination and statehood w/ homogeneous populations, served as an alternative to a 'concert of Europe.'

In reality, this translated into invitations to physical or psychological violence: threats, bullying, deportations, killing.

Even 'unmixing' was not straightforward - a 1/3 of Poland did not speak polish, Romania had 1 mil Hungarians. Treaties of Paris gave 60 million people a state of their own, turning 25 million into minorities.

Minorities and majorities did not believe into assimilation or compromise - the very essence of democracy.

Collective rights (which could have protected them) were not part of the general seettlement.

Victors denied minorities any kind of corporate status.

Alternatives to having permanent minorities were appealing to majorities: 1923 Treaty of Lausanne precedent in legitimizing population exchanges, as Christians left Turkey for Greece and Muslims vice versa.

23

One country set an example of (WW's) "imperative principle of action"2 - Turkey, harnessing state to make a homogenous national population. Not very liberal-democratic.

Ataturk read Rousseau and Comte: concluding that prowess of West Euro could be explained by their clear separation fo state and church. He assembled the 'men of the future' and did a cultural revolution - expressions of Islam were suppressed and sometimes executed. Affirmed that "only once civilization Precondition of progress of the nation is to participate in this civilization."

Ataturk proclaimed as principles of the state nationalism, laicism, republicanism, populism, revolutionism, etatism - symbolized by size arrows.

It seemed contrasted from negotiation and to many people a weak state in Western Europe.

In theory, Turkey's legitimacy conformed to Wilsonian precept of a state based on a self-determination homogenous national population.

24

"All public power dervies from the people", but how much do people actually play into that? Most Kemalists perceived Anatolian peasants and folk Islam as a threat.

A secular elite made the devlet baba - the increasingly authoritarian father-state. 1931 Turkey, a one party polity. Heirs instigated a vast personality cult around him. Turkey's legitimacy (after Ataturk died) was to be propped by charisma, unconditional affirmation of national-state bureaucracy traditional legitimacy disappeared.

Liberal principles of action did not come with the kind of political actors suited to implementing them

There were intellectuals who wanted European nation-states to co-operate in the name of peace. They risked reputations. Attempts to have cosmopolitan and bureacracies to work together failed - even men of the best will could not overcome antagonisms.

Failures reinforced growing general crisis of confidence among European elites: Europe was exhausted, physically and morally.

25

Many were looking to the US for moral and political leadership.
But then, they did isolationism - Ameicanization of the economy proceeded, hastening the descent to 'mass society.'

Very few Europeans realized that Europe lost its global pre-eminence for good.

Loss of confidence and pessimism, war had levelled and homogenized the democracy of the trenches and Lloyd' George's 'molten mass' at home.

New elite consciousness - Ernst Junger celebrated mystique new male brotherhood among social group that suffered the greatest loss

26

Legacy of two political imaginaries, politics of compromise among state, labour and capital, politics of the pursuit of rational interest.
Militarized politics of will concentrated on saving the nation.
Denials of classical nineteenth-century liberalism.

## Weber's Questions

Weber was keenly alert to what he referred to as 'the demands of the day' - the political challenges thrown up by new historical constellations.

He was a legal formalist and sought to demystify the state, arguing it was not any kind of organism and could not be identified by particular goods, defining the state through the means it used - arriving at the sentence "the state is a human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory."

Emphasis on force fitted well with Weber's image of politics as perpetual conflict, social life as never-ending struggle.

More important point concerned the legitimacy of force - gained through leglality, not through the promise of pursuing specific purposes.

It was the result of following procedures, leaving execution to an administrative stance.

Bureaucracy.

27

He divorced law from moral foundations.
Belief in natural law declined.
Law was valid if enacted as thus.

Weber was concerned that the liberal rule of law was being eroded with the emergence of the welfare state.

Rule by general statute was being conflated with decrees aimed at particular situations or specific citizens. Ideals like justice could be symbolically endorsed but would not translate into general and predictable law.

Bureaucratization proved a challenge, calling into question notions of free individuality. He was concerned for individual autonomy but saw dangers less in the 'the masses' than in social phenomena like bureaucracy and demagogy.

Weber saw two crises - of liberal statehood and mass democracy on one hand, and of the individual self on the other.

28

This page talked about [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]

29

In Weber's eyes Capitalism had no affiliation with freedom. Remorseless rationalization threatened to make Puritans into utility maximisers.

Science had proved no objective meaning in the natural order and undermined traditional and theological certainties. Science ... could not itself create new values.

Another feature: the number of different 'value spheres' and 'orders of life' with its own inner laws, aesthetic, religion, politics. They have become systematic and incompatible in the claims they made on individuals: the fully committed religious believer in pacifism was unlikely to succeed.

Since God was died, value pluralism required an irrational decision and existential commitment by individuals.

30

Every man or woman had to make their choice as to which god they served, knowing they would enter conflict with the servants of other gods.

Necessity of choice placed burden on modern individuals. Weber thus favoured an ethical stance that affirmed the fragmented world was in a spirit of self-conscious realism: as long as the modern condition was faced up to with dignity and determination.

One escape route was aestheticism, another an ethic of brotherliness, a political utopianism were all human beings would become reconciled. In particular, bureaucracy was busy fabricating a kind of bondage that might make the moderns one day as powerless as 'the fellahs of ancient Egypt.'

The modern self might be etnrapped by a structure of its own making and myth may return in secular fashion as the impersonal, dehumanizing forces that regimented individuals.

The dominance of technology and work reinforced temptations of 'subjectivist culture' where individuals were concerned with cultivating their personal experiences. One consequence was with what Weber termed the 'ultimate and most sublime values' had retreated: impersonal and incomprehensible forced, and a flight into over-stimulated subjectivity.

The notion that history had unintended consequences was widespread among German social theorists - [[Georg Simmel]].

Georg Simmel believed human beings created objective cultural forms and structures which accumulated and weighed more on succeeding generations - he insisted that the soul could find itself only through these cultural crystallizations. On the other hand the individual born into modern order confronted them without comprehending them, viewing them as oppressive.

All modern institutions had two side: bureaucracy, which could be oppressive, but as rational authority, a great achievement. What Weber called the modern impersonal machine of bureaucracy could be dismantled only at the price of reinstating arbitrary forms of rule (which make no sense), the path to Gemeinschaft was not available or desirable.

Except in WW1, when Weber celebrated the war.

Weber thought an ultimate aim of politics was to create particular forms of culture. He went so far to claim he didn't care about state form, as long as Germany emerged with more honour and a more desirable form of culture.

32

The quest for cultural significance and collective meaning explained why politics had to be kept apart from other spheres of modern life. Politics should never be about negotiating on the basis of material interests or ensuring the smooth functioning of the market: the state and public realm had its own dignity.

Weber held that the state should be preoccupied with the quality of people's character, not its wellbeing.

## The Great Experiment

There was another violent theatre of political action where the character of future people were being fought over. Weber had hoped for the emergence of a credible form of Russian liberalism but felt that the various reforms undertaken amounted merely to a kind of 'pseudo-constitutionalism.'

Weber was sceptical about Alex Kerensky, prime minister of provisional post-Tsarist government and what he saw as the triumph of a 'Duma Plutocracy' designed to keep the peasants down.

He was sceptical about the Bolsheviks who came to power - those who concluded a humiliating peace treaty with the Reich.

33

Weber could not have suspected that the October Revoluion was  not a revolution if nobody wanted it - only a few cadets and a women's battalion were left to defend it. Lenin had been determined to bring down legal authority.

Success vindicated Lenin's theory - saying that those who were serious about revolution should put their faith in a vanguard consisting of utterly committed revolutionaries, specialized skills and socialisticc consciousness. The working class without tools could never develop clarity, but he derided economism - attemtps to attain material improvements short of real socialism.

For his party of a new type, he preferred a hand of fully committed revolutionaries.

Commitment was not enough, party members guided by the correct revolutionary theories. He was said to have nothing going on except for revolution.

34

Lenin made one of the most innovative and powerful political instruments of twentieth-century Europe, a combination of discipline, business efficiency, utter emotional identification and a sense of total dedication.

The party did offer something to those looking for a charismatic institution party members exhibit devotion in a way Weber thought leaders could inspire.

Lenin inspired exceptional trust, and Bolsheviks fell in love.
Party members would exhibit devotion and a willingness to sacrifice.

35

It was not the charisma of the supreme leader, but correct organization. Lenin split his and other parties, imposing discipline and going with equal ferocity against opponents. Theory had to always be fashioned for concrete challenges.

The party with a proper theories was the leader: a true revolutionary followed the party. The vision addressed the awkward problem that orthodox Marxism had no heroic individuals.

What really helped as much as two policies: the decision to redistribute land, or to ratify the land seizures.

Lenin coutnered the obvious objection that a socialist revolution was supposed to break out in Britain and Germany with the argument that war had made Russia ready instead. He claimed a party like his could bypass a bourgeois stage.

This did not mean they should bide their time - Lenin outlined an ambitious programme of reorganizing the economy.

36

The parasite state would be abolished, democracy gone for democracy is a state which recognizes the subordination of the minority to the majority.

With Communism fully realized there would be no need for a separate public power monopolizing the means of legitimate violence

Political representation would not disappear: we cannot imagine democracy without representative institutions, but democracy without parliamentarism.

He admitted that there can be no talk of eradicating the bureaucracy at once, everywhere and completely.

37

Yet some of the most utopian claims took up marx's writings on the 1871 Paris Commune. The brief moment of the commune - workers organizing their own fairs and officials were dismantled in favour of a fusion and administration) seemed led by anarchists than Marxists, but Lenin was eager to invoke the ideal of the commune state.

Lenin then announced a retreat from the principles of the Paris commune and admitted the whole difficulty of the revolution that it was easy for them to start, but difficult to continue.
He also discovered Russian workers was a worse worker than other people in advanced countries, and could not be trusted with democracy - only French anarchists.

He believed that war should lead to a great Russian push - German State Capitalism, Russian socialism should be run as how Germans ran the war.

38

Weber thought that successful revolutionaries would have to bring their own bureaucrats; otherwise they were likely to be dominated by the existing state administration. Lenin and others realized that running something like this required specialists, reinstating the older officers.

An idea later attributed to Stalin: the state had to gain strength before it could wither away. The regime had to do whatever it could to survive in a civil war, faced with a hostile outside war - mandating later systemic 'mass terror' authorized by Lenin and promoted by Trotsky as being efficient against a reactionary state which does not want to leave the scene of operations, animated by an ethics of revolutionary violence, where the ultimate ends unambiguously justified the means.

War communism mandated the complete centralization of the party - an army under strict commands.

39

Potential dynamic and especially dangers of state capitalism did not entirely escape the revolutionaries. One problem was bureaucratiziation - less obvious one was that successful sate capitalism did not really need a capitalist approach. What emerged was a fateful duality: an expanding state with experts and specialists, and on the other, a party of professional revolutionaries.

Lenin did not abandon the commune state as a goal - the default option was to claim that for now demokratiia had to mean the dictatorship fo the proletariat, only those considered productive should be involved: rights accrued to the working and exploited people had to be disenfranchised if not worse.

Those within the party complained of bureaucratisation, wanting to return to soviet democracy as it existed in 1917-1918. In 1921, workers and sailors demanded soviets without Bolsheviks so Lenin sent in the troops. Even criticism within the party was curtailed: factions forbidden.

40

Lenin countered bureaucracy with even more bureaucracy.

This dynamic is why Weber rejected socialism, the ultimate nightmare of universal bureaucratization.

It would fuse into the dictatorship of the bureaucrat, fusing the economic and state bureaucracy.


This is not helpful, but I thought it was funny:

## Weber's Answers (For Some)

What did Weber propose?

He had hidden an allegory of German society: pointing to the autonomous personality he admired and attacking Luterhanism for having made the Germans submissive, he admonished the bourgeoise to invigorate itself through struggle.

41

He thought monarchy was the best state form, but the political system of the German empire perpetuated political immaturity, falsely suggesting that the monarch could govern when it was just the civil servants.

His prescription was clear: Parliaments with real power were crucial in neutralizing untalented monarchs, constraining bureaucracies and in providing a training ground for political judgement. They would help select charismatic leaders through competition. They would inject dynamism and direction into rule, countering the dangers of bureaucratic rule.

A price had to be paid - a soulless political machine which mobilized the vote for them.

Weber was in favour of widening the franchise - the recognition of equal state. 
He found it unbearable to think soldiers returning from the front lines should have less rights than those who stayed.

He hated the idea of giving more votes to those with higher degrees.

He also led that education in the humanities led to a lack of political judgement.

Political inclusion was the best way to foster political responsibility but he never entertained the thought that the people could actually themselves exercise power - direct democracy was only possible in very small settings where everyone knew everybody else. Anywhere else, democracy had to mean delegation - rule by some over others.

42

Weber could never see anyone as passive and incapable of understanding the complexities of modern social life. All they could do was cast a vote. Hence he dismissed the notion of a coherent popular will or mandate that could be translated into government programmes. At best, elections established a kind of popular feedback rewarding leaders who had better political skills and at least some concern for the wishes of the populace. Struggling for the vote ensured that only politicians rose to the top who were, unlike bureaucrats, decisive and, unlike pure demagogues, politically responsible. In that sense, the argument that inclusion bred responsibility was complemented by an argument that an infusion of struggle increased the quality of political leadership.

In terms of Weber's categorization of legitimacy as traditional, charismatic or legal-rational, he advocated a combination of the last two: merging teh rationalization of law and bureaucracy with the supposed personal heroism of the leader. Weber was adamant that the only alternative to leadership democracy supported by a party political machine was leaderless democracy with party bureaucrats and notables vying for influence behind the scenes.

Leadership democracy placed great burdens. Clearly Weber owed his audience an account of how leaders were ought to behave.

Every politician, according to Weber, needed three qualities:
1. Passion
2. A feeling of responsibility
3. A sense of the proportion

Passion did not denote a romantic cult of experience, it meant devotion to a chosen cause.
Such a passion was blind without a feeling of proportion and a sense of reality - in short, a capacity for keeping one's distances from freelings and one's own feelings. Conversely, a lack of objectivity - and a mindless worship of power - was a deadly sin for the politician.

43

He called a distinguish between ethic of responsibility and an ethic of conviction. The ethics of conviction was unconditional: it made the practitioner responsible only his conscience.

Politicians of conviction, such as radical pacifists and utopian socialists, were most concerned about preserving the purity of their intentions. They stuck to a naïve belief that only good would follow from good and only evil come of evil.

They ... could not understand the autonomy of the political sphere and bear the seeming ethical irrationality of a world full of unintended consequences. They could not escape the inner logic of politics - the inevitable presence of vivolence.

An ethic of responsibility ... meant that the politician would take account of the consequences of his actions, would compromise and would accept the ethical dangers involved in letting himself become the plaything of the paradoxical, even demonic forces at work in politics.

Weber did not wish to portray the politician adhering to an ethics of responsibility as a pure pragmatist, or even opportunist. He also had to adopt an ultimate worldview, the choice of which lacked any rational foundations; in addition, he would in all likelihood reach a situation where he declares: "Here I stand; I can do no other."

With an irrational cri de coeur, it seemed the ethics of responsibility would collapse into the ethics of conviction. This ... was not an ethical problem, but 'something genuinely human and moving.'

A genuine ethics of responsibility therefore steered the course between a self-centred flight from the political world on the one hand and a ruthless opportunism on the other.

44

How was this intuition to be translated into any kind of liberal political practice?

Weber was acutely, anxiously; aware that the social basis of liberalism had been eroded and that many of its ideals - progress and individual rights - has been discredited in the eyes of many contemporaries.

True, he thought the casual ... dismissal of Enlightenment ideas completely irresponsible; he warned reactionaries of all stripes that it is a 'gross self-deception' to believe that without the achievements ... but the belief in natural law ... could not be sustained in a disenchanted world.

The most plausible theoretical answer was this: liberalism should generate a new account of culture and its tasks. And these could be achieved only with politics: the public realm, affirmed in its dignity, might thereby regain some of the 'most sublime values' which had retreated from it. In addition liberals might appeal to value pluralism itself.

The human will to freedom, value pluralism could justify liberalism - in a pragmatic manner: once the plurality of values and the human need to create meaning through choosing among them had been recognised, then individualism might at least appear as attractive proposition. Each individual's choice should be recognised because one should 'regard as objectively valueable those innermost elements of the "personality" ... give meaning to our life.

Respecting actual political choices in actual circumstances were harsh. Eisner was shot.

45

The Bavarian experiment was fundamentally not serious.
Toller had been another litterateur who had become lost in politics, even a pure Gesinnungsethiker. Weber's wife reported her hsuband as saying: "God in his anger made him a politician." Toller was a poet and socialist turned into a pacifist.

Weber continued to attack party politicians - exact some influence on the new German constitution. 

46

War left new norms, but no institutions to enforce them.
This emanent failures of collective security, system of protection for minority groups lackluster.
