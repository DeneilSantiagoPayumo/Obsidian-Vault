## Introduction: rethinking Hayek

2

The Road To Serfdom, published in 1944 warned that even mild government intervention and redistribution could lead to totalitarianism - he became a critic of socialism and collectivism.

5

Let's understand his ideological and intellectual formation.

He witnessed Hitler, the New Deal, Keynes' General Theory, the opening of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of communism in Russia and so on.

8

Of course, Hayek believed that collectivism would triumph. But, there is nothing inevitable about this: it had come about through the ascendancy of a set of doctrines which were deeply flawed in their understanding of the basis of Western civilization and its success - then, we'll return to classical liberalism.

Liberalist ideology is the only way to guide modern society.

9

Hayek believed it was not enough to reach a compromise with the forces of collectivism - territory lost must be reclaimed.

10

Hayek's philosophical standpoint is to be found in *The Sensory Order*, a work of psychology and philosophy that was drafted in the 1920s and not published until 1952. It is based on Kantian assumption: direct knowledge of the physical world is impossible, the order that is found in our experience is constructed by our minds (all knowledge is partial) and finally philosophy has to discover the limits of reason

12

Many of Hayek's positions in social theory and liberal thought can be related to his Kantianism - he rejects natural rights as a basis for justice and sees justice as based on procedural arguments. Order in both science and society depends on the identification of rules and conditions which can be universalized - the establishment and enforcement of these general rules provide criteria for defining the character of the outcomes without determining in detail what those outcomes are.

The human mind is engaged in a process of classification and reclassification of experiences, the complexity of these increase. Hayek distinguishes between the physical order of external events and the sensory order of the human mind - the possibility of knowledge of the macrocosm comes about because of the formation of a microcosm within it which is capable of reproducing enough aspects of the macrocosm to allow the microcosm to exist.

24

Hayek believes that Socialism is the greatest threat and has conviction that ideas matter - a defence of liberal principles is necessary to prevent the world dominated by liberal principles.

For him, socialism makes three key claims:
- Socialism destroys the basis of morals, personal freedom, and responsibility
- Socialism impedes the production of wealth and may cause impoverishment
- Socialism will lead to a totalitarian government.

The experience of socialist societies does provide evidence of the consequences of socialism - in these circumstances, they resulted in less social justice, less production and despotism. He makes his case though on a priori grounds.

It doesn't matter if socialism does or does not lead to this conclusion, he just believes in it.


26
## Morals

He does not mean that socialism is immoral in that it has no moral vision - he accepts that socialism is a moral doctrine. The problem is that socialism is not an appropriate moral doctrine for the Great Society which civilisation has created, applicable only to the idea of the primitive society.

Socialism is a deeply flawed doctrine as it is based on intellectual errors.

### Evolution, Progress and Civilization

The human species has spent almost the whole span of its existence in primitive society.

28

Civilisation is a set of rules or institutions which has allowed societies to evolve to a point where this transition became possible - a set of rules constructed over many centuries and setbacks.

Hayek asserts that man's biological equipment failed to keep pace with his cultural and institutional innovation - his instincts and emotions are better adapted to the life of a hunter than to life in civilisation. This is why civilisation has been regarded as unhealthy.

For Hayek, human beings have been civilised against their instincts and emotions - they remain socialists at heart. Socialism is the innate moral emotions and instincts acquired during 500,000 years of experience: in order to maintain a civilized society, and an economic order these emotions and instincts must be repressed.

Socialism encourages two moral instincts: solidarity and altruism, the two great obstacles to the development of the modern economy. They two suggest that there can be a common purpose. In these primitive societies, achievement of a common purpose was integral but in the Great Society, the pursuit of a common purpose for the whole of society is an illusion.

The morality required by the Great Society is one of individual freedom and responsibility. The 'good natural instincts of the tribal band' were subdued by culturally developed rules of conduct.

30

His mere justification for Great Society is that of its ability to sustain a large population. The way that the division of labour has evolved favoured the poor more than the rich, making it possible a huge increase in their numbers. The only way of dealing with these problems would be to encourage the adoption of institutions and morality.

The problem is that Civilization and the Great Society were the result of unplanned development, not design - these moral rules have been adopted not because anyone understood that these were the best rules, but the groups who accidentally adopted them prospered.

This view was of cultural selection, not human intelligence and design. Ruthless and functional.

The most important characteristic of modern civilization is its individualism, coming from a number of sources. Freedom is not a state of nature but an artefact of civilization.

31

The individualist civilization only works by imposing a severe discipline on all human beings who must repress their instincts.

Civilization for Hayek represents a thin crust - its achievements are provisional and fragile. New generations must understand it. There is no going back - no other society can support such a huge population. What we must do is understand how the Great Society came into existence and what can be done to sustain its institutions and its values.

Everything is accidental

32

There are two kinds of rationalism - evolutionary rationalism and constructivist rationalism.

The former - concerned with understanding how civilization has developed and what principles underlie it. Change must be slow. Constructivist rationalism is prepared to obliterate everything, seeing human reason, human will, human intention in all institutions and behaviours - human societies can be mastered by human beings and remodelled according to rational criteria. Societies can be organized to abolish social evils.

33

Hayek builds on Mandeville's insights, seeing human society as an enterprise which no individual or group of individuals could hope to understand fully. No attempt to operate a free society can be successful can be unless there is reverence for institutions - look at Burke, the experiment of manking.
