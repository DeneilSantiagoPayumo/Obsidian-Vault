## Introduction: rethinking Hayek

2

The Road To Serfdom, published in 1944 warned that even mild government intervention and redistribution could lead to totalitarianism - he became a critic of socialism and collectivism.

5

Let's understand his ideological and intellectual formation.

He witnessed Hitler, the New Deal, Keynes' General Theory, the opening of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of communism in Russia and so on.

8

Of course, Hayek believed that collectivism would triumph. But, there is nothing inevitable about this: it had come about through the ascendancy of a set of doctrines which were deeply flawed in their understanding of the basis of Western civilization and its success - then, we'll return to classical liberalism.

Liberalist ideology is the only way to guide modern society.

9

Hayek believed it was not enough to reach a compromise with the forces of collectivism - territory lost must be reclaimed.

10

Hayek's philosophical standpoint is to be found in *The Sensory Order*, a work of psychology and philosophy that was drafted in the 1920s and not published until 1952. It is based on Kantian assumption: direct knowledge of the physical world is impossible, the order that is found in our experience is constructed by our minds (all knowledge is partial) and finally philosophy has to discover the limits of reason

12

Many of Hayek's positions in social theory and liberal thought can be related to his Kantianism - he rejects natural rights as a basis for justice and sees justice as based on procedural arguments. Order in both science and society depends on the identification of rules and conditions which can be universalized - the establishment and enforcement of these general rules provide criteria for defining the character of the outcomes without determining in detail what those outcomes are.

The human mind is engaged in a process of classification and reclassification of experiences, the complexity of these increase. Hayek distinguishes between the physical order of external events and the sensory order of the human mind - the possibility of knowledge of the macrocosm comes about because of the formation of a microcosm within it which is capable of reproducing enough aspects of the macrocosm to allow the microcosm to exist.

24

Hayek believes that Socialism is the greatest threat and has conviction that ideas matter - a defence of liberal principles is necessary to prevent the world dominated by liberal principles.

For him, socialism makes three key claims:
- Socialism destroys the basis of morals, personal freedom, and responsibility
- Socialism impedes the production of wealth and may cause impoverishment
- Socialism will lead to a totalitarian government.

The experience of socialist societies does provide evidence of the consequences of socialism - in these circumstances, they resulted in less social justice, less production and despotism. He makes his case though on a priori grounds.

It doesn't matter if socialism does or does not lead to this conclusion, he just believes in it.


26
## Morals

He does not mean that socialism is immoral in that it has no moral vision - he accepts that socialism is a moral doctrine. The problem is that socialism is not an appropriate moral doctrine for the Great Society which civilisation has created, applicable only to the idea of the primitive society.

Socialism is a deeply flawed doctrine as it is based on intellectual errors.

### Evolution, Progress and Civilization

The human species has spent almost the whole span of its existence in primitive society.

28

Civilisation is a set of rules or institutions which has allowed societies to evolve to a point where this transition became possible - a set of rules constructed over many centuries and setbacks.

Hayek asserts that man's biological equipment failed to keep pace with his cultural and institutional innovation - his instincts and emotions are better adapted to the life of a hunter than to life in civilisation. This is why civilisation has been regarded as unhealthy.

For Hayek, human beings have been civilised against their instincts and emotions - they remain socialists at heart. Socialism is the innate moral emotions and instincts acquired during 500,000 years of experience: in order to maintain a civilized society, and an economic order these emotions and instincts must be repressed.

Socialism encourages two moral instincts: solidarity and altruism, the two great obstacles to the development of the modern economy. They two suggest that there can be a common purpose. In these primitive societies, achievement of a common purpose was integral but in the Great Society, the pursuit of a common purpose for the whole of society is an illusion.

The morality required by the Great Society is one of individual freedom and responsibility. The 'good natural instincts of the tribal band' were subdued by culturally developed rules of conduct.

30

His mere justification for Great Society is that of its ability to sustain a large population. The way that the division of labour has evolved favoured the poor more than the rich, making it possible a huge increase in their numbers. The only way of dealing with these problems would be to encourage the adoption of institutions and morality.

The problem is that Civilization and the Great Society were the result of unplanned development, not design - these moral rules have been adopted not because anyone understood that these were the best rules, but the groups who accidentally adopted them prospered.

This view was of cultural selection, not human intelligence and design. Ruthless and functional.

The most important characteristic of modern civilization is its individualism, coming from a number of sources. Freedom is not a state of nature but an artefact of civilization.

31

The individualist civilization only works by imposing a severe discipline on all human beings who must repress their instincts.

Civilization for Hayek represents a thin crust - its achievements are provisional and fragile. New generations must understand it. There is no going back - no other society can support such a huge population. What we must do is understand how the Great Society came into existence and what can be done to sustain its institutions and its values.

Everything is accidental

32

There are two kinds of rationalism - evolutionary rationalism and constructivist rationalism.

The former - concerned with understanding how civilization has developed and what principles underlie it. Change must be slow. Constructivist rationalism is prepared to obliterate everything, seeing human reason, human will, human intention in all institutions and behaviours - human societies can be mastered by human beings and remodelled according to rational criteria. Societies can be organized to abolish social evils.

33

Hayek builds on Mandeville's insights, seeing human society as an enterprise which no individual or group of individuals could hope to understand fully. No attempt to operate a free society can be successful can be unless there is reverence for institutions - look at Burke, the experiment of mankind that cannot be removed.

Hayek distinguishes between true individualism and false individualism: intellectual history has been distorted by the tendency to equate the history of liberalism and the case for modern society. The political doctrines here have dominated, being cast in ride. There is another liberal tradition that seeks to embrace modernity and is not reactionary in the sense of trying to restore pre-modern conditions but rejects constructivist rationalism and supports an understanding of the development of modern society, based on deep scepticism

True individualism must not be infected by constructivist rationalism. If so, liberalism turns to socialism. If so, all human culture is in danger of being lost

36

## Cosmos and Taxis

Perhaps the key concept is the tradition of 'true individualism', the concept of spontaneous order. He distinguishes between two kinds of orders: a made order and a grown order. A made order belongs to constructivist rationalism and is closely related to authoritarian conceptions order - order seen as resting upon a relationship of command and obedience, signifying a hierarchy.

Taxis - a made order that flows from human will and intention
Cosmos - a spontaneous order that nobody consciously creates, if authority is exercised, it will be authoritarian in form

A taxi should have a single will and not be diluted.

While the Great Society may contain many organizations, it has no single directing centre - it is the outcome of competition between many wills ... it generates dependency and discourages self-reliance, undermining morality and achievements of Western civilization.

## Individualism and Socialism

Hayek believes Capitalism lacks moral legitimacy only because the inappropriate and damaging moral instincts of socialism have been allowed to dominate public debate.

He has a low opinion of human nature.

Acting in accordance with self-interest deserves the most praise.

He agrees with Hume that moral beliefs are ingrained in every individual but he draws a distinction between moral instinct of the past and the market order. Survival of the fittest remain.

## Freedom and Coercion

There are opposites - Freedom is the condition of man which is coercion of some by order is reproduced as much as possible in a society. Personal freedom - will of another. Freedom is the relation of an individual to another.

Essentials of liberty: only if subject to all same laws, if he immune from confinement, can choose his work, can acquire property and coercing men to do their biddings

The first and second - negative liberty. The third - positive. The fourth...?

Hayek distrusts political action but offers a positive: a negative conception of liberty and opens possibilities for political intervention. Thee desert spring - if the spring is controlled by a monopolist, that is an act of coercion.

Coercion is evil, eliminating the person as a real figure.

Socialism undermines morality as it has an inadequate conception of the individualist basis of this civilisation, failing to understand the necessity for the sphere of the individual to be protected. Only if coercion is reduced, can civilisation progress through the best rules.

They must be responsible for their own welfare, their families, their own choices - if there was no freedom there would be no moral esteem.

Socialism creates dependency and undermines self-reliance.

## 2 Markets

Skipped to the uses of knowledge.

67

His theory develops two insights: that knowledge is imperfect on human societies and that the cost of any economic activity is subjective. The character of knowledge in a market economy is dispersed, fragmented, and decentralized, and thus this allows the market to work as is intended - each agent has knowledge and resources and the market helps to coordinate this together.

Hayek argues that central planning was fundamentally flawed as it assumes that knowledge could somehow be collected by a central authority and employed to construct a more perfect market than the one which had evolved spontaneously.

For Hayek, the market was not something that could be redesigned - it is a natural phenomenon. The task of central authority is limited to ensuring that the basic conditions of the market were maintained and that obstacles to the further development of the market should be removed.

This attempt to centralize the market is a massive error on the constructivist part.

Pessimism about the capacity of human reason lies at the root of Hayek's theory of knowledge: the market is the instrument for mobilizing the knowledge that is dispersed in time and space, but there is no way that the knowledge can be utilized other than through the market process itself.

69

Sure, the market sucks, but it's less imperfect than any other alternative and less imperfect than what would happen if we went into a socialist economy.

For Hayek, the key problem is whether a socialist economy could provide the incentive required to allow dispersed information to be utilized in producing goods and services - only the market, competition and private property are inextricably linked. Only capitalist institutions can ensure market co-ordination will deliver an efficient economy.

### The Theory of Competition

Central planning is doomed to function as the knowledge to make it work could never be collected.

Attempts by a central authority to stimulate a market would not be successful either as it ignored the market's ability to function as an innovating discovery process.

Marx viewed competition between different parts of capital as the mechanism by which a climate of insecurity and change was created, obliging enterprise to search for new ways to cut their costs and increase their profits. This pressure was the stimulus for introduction of new products, technology, expansion of market relationships and more.

Marx believed that the stage of capitalism is purely a transitional stage to a higher form of social organization whereas Hayek argued the market order was the highest form of development possible.

The existence of competition is not optional. Without competition, economic activities cannot take place. Many enterprise make mistakes but there's no other way.

72

One of the fundamental tensions in Hayek's thought is between his conception of the ideal liberal society and his defence of the realities of contemporary capitalist society as embodying that ideal - here that ideal society will be decentralized and that many individuals should be directly involved in making decisions. The ideal individual is the entrepreneur - those prepared to take calculated risks and make use of the knowledge available to them.

Such a society would be composed of independent, self-employed producers who would own their means of production and exchange their products freely on the market. All members of society thereof are equal before the law.

Hayek instead defends concentrations of market power and large-scale companies as legitimate agents of the market process. What then becomes of Hayek's insistence on the decentralized character of knowledge and the moral character of participation in the market?

Hayek never solves this problem - he argues that enterprise monopoly is a minor problem in the contemporary economy and that anti-trust and anti-monopoly policies are unnecessary as competition will constrain everything. He argues that large companies do not pose the same problems as trade unions and there's no coercion to be found.

In a sense, if individuals do not face the uncertainty of the market, they won't be able to sustain a free market culture.

Hayek's conclusion is that so long as the majority of citizens are employees, the chances of breaking with collectivism are slim because there is no reason why employees should be appreciative of the market system - they are more aware of its cost and demand policies protect them from it.

They'll never understand.

## 4 Politics

75

The third strand - socialism leads to totalitarianism. A central purpose of his later works was to demonstrate that political co-ordination of societies through bureaucracies was inherently inferior to economic co-ordination through markets. He wished then to minimize the role of politics and government.

76

Hayek shared with Keynes the belief that ideas are more important than interests in determining political outcomes, the belief that the ideas which come to dominate public opinion are the ones that shape government and therefore determine the scope of government in modern societies.

The institutions he advocated imposed themselves on human societies as a structural imperative - they were the product of a natural process of social evolution which could not be altered except at the risk of damaging prosperity and liberty. In his analysis, civilisation is a very fragile construction.

Here, fascism and communism are closely linked to one another and socialism - the conflicts between the three were conflicts between different factions of a single movement.

Hayek proceeds from his principles: Capitalism belongs to the civilisation based on liberal individualism which socialism in all its forms attacks and undermines - Capitalism therein is just a set of ideal principles of social organization.

What happened in German is a train of thought: the people who were prepared by the embrace of collectivist ideas. He laments the fact that all the people whose views influence development are now in some sense socialists.

78

Hayek's pessimism about trends in modern society was very deep. It was a product of a deep conflict at the heart of Western civilization between two sets of ideas - it was wrong to draw a divide between totalitarian countries and democratic countries when democratic countries are infected by the same virus.

Hayek contrasts the abandoned road of liberalism with the collectivist road of twentieth-century socialism - Hayek never accepted the argument such as [[Max Weber]] and [[Schumpeter]] that liberalism's failure was either the nature of liberalism itself or structural changes in modern industrial societies - his explanation is idealist and voluntarist.

The reason is because human societies go into serfdom is because of they are ignorant of the implications of thought.

One paradox emerges: only one form of economic organisation would work but he also argued that there's no guarantee that human societies would choose the institutions that would strengthen the institutions that were the pillars of Western civilisation.

What was at risk in the twentieth century was nineteenth-century liberalism.

80

What does Hayek mean by individualism? It means recognising that the views and tastes of the individual are supreme in their sphere and that every person should be able to develop their gifts. No obstacles then should be placed in the way of the individual entrepreneur or innovator. The triumph of liberal civilization is measured by the extent of which these obstacles have been removed.

Individualism is tied with commerce and science. Innovation could only occur in a private realm which is free from invasion. Liberalism became the political doctrine that reflected on the conditions under which individualism could advance - it was an enabling doctrine.

He was not opposed to intervention - there's a difference between creating competition and passively accepting institutions. It was because liberalism has been interpreted as accepting whatever emerged spontaneously as natural and right. An active government was the right institution to release the energies of individualism.

All we had to do was create institutions that supported market change.

Hayek saw the development of modern industry as a catastrophe - it was a disaster that we don't understand the role played by market society.

82

He illustrates this argument from [[Karl Mannhein]] - arguing that "we have never had to set up and direct the entire system of nature as completely as we are forced to do today with society ... Mankind is tending more and more to regulate the whole of its social life." Despite that, he completely misses the phrase 'as completely' and ignored the context of Mannheim's argument - he was comparing marshes and factories and pointing out the ways in which factories were organized made regulation inevitable.

He never properly engaged with the arguments of modern sociology - never read Max Weber or anything.  Hayek acknowledges Mannheim's theory that modern factories and organizations are highly collectivist institutions and their internal co-ordination does not depend on individualist market exchange. he deplores the fact that most individuals are forced to be employees but sees no incompatibility between this and a liberal society.

If he studied these ideas he might've concluded that to preserve the kind of individualist society he valued would've required measures that restrict the size of organizations and promote small and medium-sized enterprise.

His explanation for the advance of collectivism considers only the role of ideas. Ideas are not autonomous, socio-political institutions not a matter of choice: conflicting with Hayek's argument that economic and social institutions just evolve spontaneously.

He lacks an analysis of politics - moving between arguing that only institutions capable of Great Society are the product of spontaneous evolution and at the same time that human beings have to exercise foresight and make a choice between individualism and collectivist road.

84
### Socialism and National Socialism

For Hayek, socialism and national socialism belong together and that national socialism is the natural destination of all socialist parties if they wish to remain socialist. He argues that liberals have been lured by the socialist.

This is an illusion - any ability to make the ideals of socialism real will result in fascism or Stalinism. 

This is because as such: there are only two ways of coordinating a modern industrial society - administration and markets. The first involves central direction, coercion and the imposition of uniformity. Equality is achieved at the expense of liberty. The second method involves markets, individual exchange, maximum liberty and variety. There is no middle way, just fools.

He identifies socialism with central direction and liberalism with markets, making his argument binary. He never confronts the objection that a combination of methods is needed.

He aimed to show that there was no resting-place for socialists short of complete central direction of the economy and society. The utopia of democratic socialism was built around ideals of social justice, and socialists wanted to abolish private property. But if they did so, they would destroy the basis of prosperity.

His arguments depends on two assumptions: first that there was a necessary link between the growth of civilisation and a 'steady diminution of the sphere in which individual actions are bound by fixed rules.' Second, that there is a domino effect where once the state expands, it cannot stop.

The first - socialism is reactionary as it reverses the trend of characteristic modernity.
The second - socialists are prisoners of a logic they do not understand.

He recommends liberalism for its values and because it will develop the unique Western civilization that emerged soon. Individuals should be allowed, within limits, to follow their preferences. The state should only exist as to only do few functions, and not to impose their ideas.

86

Therein, he recommends a limited state. Any growth of the private sphere, the more pressure for it to expand. Once the state does so, it controls the entire economy.

Socialism and individualism represent two forms of social organization, the commercial and the military, the system of voluntary exchange and the system of command. Military organization achieves security but only through restricting liberty and imposing a hierarchical order.

Hayek identifies the demand for greater security as the most powerful source. The state has a role in ensuring security, but because collectivists don't understand how the market works they will undermine it.

A central part of his thesis is that a central system leads to despotism - the difference (between collectivism and fascism) lay in the moral atmosphere, the loss of independence, self-reliance, moral integrity and corruption of power. Socialism can only be put into place with methods that democratic socialists would disapprove.

Additionally, a central economy cannot be planned on an international basis.

89

Hayek draws attention to mystical elements in German tradition that feed Nazism but he is unable to prove that German democratic socialism was inherently totalitarianism, as it was crushed. This also ignores that Nazi seizure of power relied on support from conservative parties.

He pays no attention to shifting balance of forces and strength, just ideas. Hitler's success is not just due to his ideas.

## Democracy

Many of the dangers came through democracy - he believes democracy is a device that must be justified through its results.

92

It is just way too easy to twist it to assault liberty. Democracy can and should be discarded when liberty is threatened.

A democracy will tend towards totalitarianism unless its powers are constrained by an acceptance of liberal principles. Democracy is a doctrine about determining what the law should be - it has no content itself.

This is n arrow: he doesn't believe that there is a range of alternatives among which citizens of a democracy can choose. We must be liberalist. We cannot reach decisions through majority voting with the view of whatever the majority decided should prevail.

For him, liberalism and democracy are easily separated. Only liberal democracy is capable.

There is a long tradition among democrats and liberals that all decisions which require state action should be decided by majority vote. That said, there is a sharp divide between liberal and democratic thinkers about the scope of state action that should be determined by democratic decision-making.

Two views of popular sovereignty: status of a principle which is at least important as liberal principle of freedom. Democracy is not just a procedural principle. This makes majority rule unlimited. Popular sovereignty sucks as the organization of society is already given. The job of politics is just to preserve as thus.

94

Additionally, no system of counting votes is better than the other. The same rule applies to all.

The apartheid scheme could have been defended on Hayekian principles - the government was elected under simple plurality rules and a liberal regime which upheld private property.

He lists the arguments for democracy as follows:
1. It is the only method of peaceful change
2. It is an important safeguard of individual liberty
3. It is the only effective method of educating the majority

96

The pluralism of a Great Society means its impossible to unify it except through coercive means,
Once the coercive state's powers were increased, there was no stopping-place short of totalitarianism. To prevent this, the powers of temporary majorities had to be limited by long-term principles. There's no way thus that civilisations can understand the conditions for liberalism. Perhaps we need authoritarianism.

Lots of things in values were the work of minorities - majorities often persecuted minorities.
