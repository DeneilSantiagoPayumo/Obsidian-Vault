## THE IDEA OF A SPONTANEOUS SOCIAL ORDER

### Spontaneous order versus the constructivist fallacy 26

For Hayek, this cannot be the role of reason: the mind is as much a spontaneous order as is the human body or the human brain, and our ideas are merely the visible exfoliation of spontaneous forces - the order of our ideas is supervenient upon the spontaneous order of the mind, which it can never reconstruct or hope to supplant.

Our conscious selves can never be the governors of our mental lives for they are dependent upon the unseen workings of spontaneous order in the cosmos of nature and society.

### The central conceptions of spontaneous order and its applications to physical and social phenomena 30

Order in society is a spontaneous formation is given by the economic theory of market exchanges, where the thesis is that unhampered markets display a tendency to equilibrium.

Selective evolution is the source of all order, not only biological evolution. At the same time, he never maintains that the mechanism of Darwinian evolution must be replicated - the profit-and-loss system provides a mechanism for the elimination of 'unfit' enterprises.

Here evolution occurs via the impact of the practices and institutions, the rules of action and perception, of groups on the life chances of their members.

It is made of:
The invisible-hand thesis:
The thesis of primary of tacit or practical knowledge - our knowledge of the world is embodied first of all in practices and skills
The thesis of the natural selection of competitive traditions and rules of action and the claim that there is a continuous evolutionary filtering.

### The application of spontaneous order in economic life: the catallaxy 33

The central claim of Hayek's philosophy is that knowledge is at its base at once practical and abstract - abstract inasmuch as even sensory perception gives us a model of our environment which is highly selective and picks out only certain classes of events, and is practical as most knowledge is stored in rules of action and perception.

Social order facilitates the achievement of human purposes: taken in itself, it has no purpose. 

This confusion of a genuine hierarchical economy - such as that of an army, a school or corporation - with the realm of social exchange, the catallaxy, informs many aspects of welfare economics and motivates its interventionist projects via the fiction of a total social product. This is the result of an inability to acknowledge that the order which is the product of a conscious direction.

The demand that social life be reconstructed in the character of a factory ... springs in great measure from an inability to grasp how in the market process itself there is a constant tendency to self-regulation by spontaneous order.


Hayek explains in soviet-style economies of attempts to stimulate market processes in computer modelling - these models are bound to fail because they neglect the knowledge-gathering role of market pricing. Knowledge is embodied in habits and dispositions of countless men and women, dispersed throughout society. The knowledge yielded by market pricing is knowledge which all men can use, but which none of them would possess in the absence of the market process - the knowledge embodied is systemic or holistic and unknown to any elements of the system.

No simulation can rival the operation of the market order.

Some points:
When Hayek speaks of economic calculation under socialism as a practical impossibility ... socialist planning could supplant market processes only if practical knowledge could be replaced by theoretical or technical knowledge. The kind of omniscience demanded of a socialist planner is too out of reach.

We all know socialist economies depend on their planning policies - shadows cast by market processes distorted by episodes of authoritarian intervention.
The consequence thereof is its impossibility - we cannot analyse the socialist economies unless we penetrate the ideological veil they secrete themselves behind.

The final implication that the impossibility of socialism is an epistemological impossibility - the inability of any social order in which the market is suppressed or distorted to utilize effectively the practical knowledge possessed by its citizens. Calculational chaos would ensue and a barbarization of social life would result. In absence of the signals transmitted via the price mechanism, they would not be able to understand how to direct their activities for the social good and the common stock of practical knowledge would begin to decay.

The impossibility of socialism then derives from its neglect of the epistemological functions of market institutions and processes.

### Cultural Evolution and the natural selection of traditions 39

Socialists fail to understand the character of the market as a discovery procedure.

Hayek concerns himself with conflict.

Such inner conflicts may be less likely in simple societies. If the conflict of internalized social rules leads to increasing complexity in the society, then this complexity will tend to be not merely self-replicating but also self-reinforcing.

Also, conflicts of internalized norms, rules or roles will not lead dynamic growth or increased complexity.

Hayek's reference to the wisdom of inherited moral convention may suggest that he sees this as massive and monolith and reccomends uncritical immersion.

...

Hayek attributes a role to uncritical rule-following more fundamental than the function of diminishing information costs. His claim that social rules must be regarded as vehicles of inarticulate knowledge of a kind that is indispensable to social order - once society comes to be pervaded by the attitude that rules are no more than means to known ends, much of the common stock of tacit knowledge is lost.

Hayek recognizes that the inheritance of social rules shapes and moulds individual goals and structures agents' deliberative capacities.

Secondly, calculation by individuals will be successful only if it invokes the tacit knowledge that is embedded in the inheritance of social rules.

The third element - displaces fundamental explanation in social life from individual choices to genetic fitness on the one hand the spontaneous orders on the other hand. This sharpens the contrast between Hayek's method and that of the rational-choice theorists of the economic approach.
### THE LAW OF LIBERTY

### The origins and nature of law 54

Hayek's argument is that we are bound to recognize in our current moral conventions the outcome of a long evolutionary process.

He does not subscribe to any sort of ethical relativism or evolutionism ... but does this mean that humanity's changing morals don't have some invariant core?

There is in Hayek a fundamental utilitarian commitment in their theories of morality - an indirect utilitarianism. This component is indirect in that it is never supposed by him that we ought to invoke a utilitarian principle, we must follow the code of behaviour accepted in our own society.

This code can never properly be the subject of a rational reconstruction in Benthamite fashion but only reformed piecemeal and slowly - Hayek makes it clear that the utilitarian aspect of his moral theory is indirect utilitarian.

For Hayek it is not any principle of utility that is foundational, but rather a Kantian test of universalizability. Hayek's insight - the demands of justice need not be competitive with the claims of general welfare, rather, a framework of justice is an indispensable condition of the successful achievement of general welfare.

Hayek explicitly repudiates any hedonistic conception of the content of utility itself - the test of any system of rules is whether it maximizes an anonymous individual's chance of achieving his unknown purpose.

### INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW 59

Individual liberty is a creature of the law and does not exist outside any civil society - rule of law will protect individual liberty only if it already incorporates strong moral rights to freedoms of various sorts.

### The Rule of Law and The Myth of Social Justice 69

Law for Hayek is part of the natural history of mankind, it emerges directly from men's dealings with each other, it is coeval with society and so antedates the emergence of the state.

The principles of law are immanent aspects of social life, and their statement Hayek has called nomos, the law of liberty. Modern legislation is called thesis. Majoritarian democracy has confused these distinctions utterly and encouraged an identification of law with the wishes of the sovereign majority of the moment.

In making these proposals, Hayek is concerned to lay emphasis on unencumbered judicial process as the best guarantor of individual freedom.

The most powerful threat to law comes from contemporary ideas of distribute or social justice, and Hayek criticises this.

The modern conception of social justice attributes the character of justice or injustice to the whole pattern of social life, with all its component rewards and losses, rather than to the conduct of its component individuals, inverting the original and authentic sense of liberty, attributable only to individual actions.

The rule of law must in treating citizens anonymously and be indifferent to the inequalities in men's initial endowments and material fortunes - aiming to equalize these latter would involve treating men differently and unequally and would not provide many serious inequities.

Contemporary distributivist conceptions are not straightforwardly egalitarian, involving conceptions of need or merit as criteria for just distribution in society. Hayek says:

- Not all needs or merits are commensurable with each other. 

A medical need involving relieving pain is not ranked against one involving the preservation of life. These dilemmas will occur elsewhere such as housing.

Each (referring to physicians) should be rewarded according to the value of their services to their patients. The principle of rewarding people according to the value of their services to others shows clearly that the only principle of justice application to distribution in a free society is that of commutative justice - attempts to impose any other principle on the free exchange of free men involves imposing upon them a hierarchy of ends and goals, a ranking of values about which no consensus exists.

The modern ideas of social justice threaten the transformation of the free order into a totalitarian organization.

## ECONOMIC THEORY AND PUBLIC POLICY 76

Hayek's view stands in sharp opposition to any idea of a policy science or a political technology aimed at producing specific desired effects - such a science demands the impossible of its practitioners.

The idea of a policy science ... neglect the tendencies to self-regulation which the market process displays. The catallaxy is but one instance of spontaneous order.

Hayek stresses the productivity and efficiency of the market process and contrasts this with the chaos and waste of socialist and interventionist systems.


...

Equilibrium is for Hayek a matter of market actors behaving in ways which allow their activities to mesh or integrate. Whether they succeed in coordinating will depend on how accurate their beliefs and expectations about each others behaviour turn out to be.

## ASSESSMENT AND CRITICISM 112

### The status and content of the idea of spontaneous order in society 114

Hayek's conception of spontaneous order has three elements: the invisible-hand thesis; the thesis of the primacy of tacit or practical knowledge; and the thesis of the natural selection of tradition.

The failure of interventionist policies to obtain their goals will only rarely lead to their abandonment, since they will always have the support of vociferous interest groups who are their beneficiaries. Once the constitutional framework of society becomes an object of political struggle, as it is bound to do in an age of unlimited democracy, there is a momentum in the trend to statism which transcends the interests and even the wishes of the political actors involved. When he fears that every other actors will use the power of government against him, each man will be impelled to seek to use governmental power in his own interests.

This is a legal war of all against all - the mechanism of Hayek's road to serfdom, showing that the worst are bound to come out on top in a totalitarian scheme.

In an interventionist democracy, as David Friedman has observed, every man is in a public good trap in virtue of which he is constrained to act against his own interests - human action can bring about a bad state of affairs without anyone intending it. Hayek's idea of spontaneous order is to be understood.

If spontaneous order is to be understood in this value-free way, it has no necessary connection with individual liberty. A traditional conservative might favour the anti-liberal practices thrown up by cultural evolution in some societies and resist their reform or revision. How does spontaneous order enter the argument for liberty?

Hayek does not view the free society as a necessary or inevitable terminus of cultural evolution. He is insistent that there is no law of evolution, and that the trend to liberty may always be defeated.

Spontaneous order strengthens the case for liberty - constructivist planning is bound to be always limited and often self-defeating. Look at socialism.

Orderly relationships do not presuppose command structures and coercion is not the commonest way of integrating human activities. 

### Conservatism and Radicalism in Hayek's Social Philosophy 125

First objection suggests that Hayek's social philosophy embodies conflicting commitments to libertarian individualism and cultural traditionalism - combining two outlooks, that the individual is sovereign, and human individuality is itself a cultural achievement for which human individuality is itself a cultural achievement.

It betrays insight into his argument - his claim that human individuality depends for its exercise and even its existence on a cultural matrix of traditional practices which shape and permeate the moral and intellectual capacities of the individual.
