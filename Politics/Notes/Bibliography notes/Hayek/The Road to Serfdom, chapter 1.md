[[Hayek and Economic Liberty]]
# THE ABANDONED ROAD

11

We are convinced of one thing: that the leading ideas which during the last generation have become common to most people of goodwill and have determined the major changes in our social life cannot have been wrong: we are ready to accept any explanation except one: that the present state of the world may have been the result of genuine error on our part.

It is somewhat difficult to think of Germany and Italy as products of a development in thought we have shared ... the history of these countries in the years before the rise of the totalitarian system showed us few features which we are not familiar. The external conflict is a result of a transformation of European thought in which others have moved so much faster as to bring them into irreconcilable conflict with our ideals, but which has not left us unaffected.

13

These social changes mean a complete change in the direction of the evolution of our ideas and social order. For at least 25 years before the spectre of totalitarianism, we strayed away from the basic ideas on which European civilisation has been built and this brought us with totalitarian horror.

This confirms the warnings of the liberal fathers - we abandoned that freedom in economic affairs. We have been warned that socialism means slavery and we have ignored that.

14

The Nazi leader who described the national-socialist revolution as a counter-Renaissance spoke truly - it destroyed that civilisation that modern men had build up.

Individualism, of which we speak in contrast to socialism and collectivism, has no connection with egotism and selfishness. 

The transformation of a rigidly organised hierarchic system in which one man could shape their own life where man gained the opportunity of knowing and choosing between different forms of life is associated with the growth of commerce.

15

During the modern period (of the growth of commerce) in European history, the direction of social development freed the individual from the ties which bound him to the prescribed ways in pursuit of his ordinary activities.

The uncontrolled actions of individuals could thus create a complex order of economic activities - favouring the argument that economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic activity.

16

The inventive faculty of man is shown by these automatic toys, mechanical contrivances and more. The attempts towards an industrial use of mechanical inventions were suppressed and desire for knowledge inhibited as long as the beliefs on the great majority of what is right and proper barred the innovator.

The nature of our civilisation has been seen clearly by enemies than friends - totalitarian is the force that build up our civilisation. The 19th century made all classes conscious of freedom, to develop a patchy matter and spread it.

This growth made humanity better. We found the dark spots, and exterminated it.

17

We cannot do justice to this growth if we measure it by our present standards. We must believe that this success surpassed man's wildest dreams.

There is nothing to make liberalism a stationary creed - we should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society and resort as little as possible to coercion.

18

There is a difference between creating a system in which competition will work as beneficially as possible, and one that accepts institutions as they are. We cannot argue on the principle of laissez-faire.

With this attitude of laissez-faire taken by many liberals, it is inevitable that once their position was penetrated it will collapse. These measures of imposing rules on businesses confer visible benefits on some and indirect harm on others - nothing short of hard-and-fast rule would have been effective.

With this attitude taken, it was inevitable that the position will collapse - this position being weakened even more as we see the slow progress of a policy which aimed at gradual improvement of the institutional framework of a free society. This depends on the growth of our understanding of social forces and conditions favourable to them. The first requisite is to understand these social forces.

No sensible person should have doubted that the crude rules of economic policy were only a beginning - there are so much more to learn. This however could only come as mastery of te forces.

19

There were many tasks: handling of the monetary system, controlling a monopoly and so on that we needed to deal with. Governments possessed immense powers for good and evil and there was reason to expect that with understanding of these problems, we could use these powers successfully.

That said, liberalism had to rely largely on the gradual increase of wealth it brought about through freedom - it had to fight proposals, it had been regarded as a negative creed as it offered a lot to particular people than to some. The very success of liberalism has became its decline.

Because of this growing impatience, the just irritation of those who used liberal phrases for anti-social privileges and bound-less ambition, it came to pass that the belief in liberalism was gone.

20

People began to be more greedy, the rapid satisfaction of those barred by adherence to the old principles, it became accepted that further advances were not possible. Therefore, we must completely scrap and replace it - the hope of the generation changed.

This is not the place to discuss how changes in outlooks was fostered by this lack of critical analysis. All we are concerned about is how our attitudes towards society changed gradually - its cumulative effect brought a fundamental difference between the older liberal attitude towards society and the present approach to social problems/

21

The question is no longer how we can best use forces - we have replaced the impersonal market with the collective and conscious direction of all social forces to deliberately chosen goals.

This change in the trend of ideas coincided with a reversal of the direction in which ideas has coincided with a reversal of the direction in which ideas have travelled in space - the reign of English ideas could only expand so much, until it became an importer of ideas. Germany then became the centre.

22

It was in Germany where these ideas were perfected.

It was forgotten that Germany created socialism - in her parliament, carried on in Austria, that English socialists are unaware their problems were discussed by Germans long ago.

The intellectual influence were supported not merely by Germany's great material progress but also its reputation that they have gained.

It soon served to assist the spreading from Germany of ideas directed against the foundations of that civilisation - the Germans are aware of that conflict that what had been the common heritage of European civilisation became to them "Western" civilisation - where Western in this sense being Liberalism and Democracy, Capitalism and Individualism, Free Trade and so on.

The people of the West imported these German ideas and believed that their own convictions had been a rationalisation of selfish interests - that Free Trade was a doctrine invented to further British interests.
