[[Self-rule]] - [[Mahatma Gandhi]]

Q: Would you kindly give a broad but comprehensive picture of the independent India?
A: "Independence of India should mean independence of the whole of India ... Independence must mean that of the people of India, not of those who are today ruling over them. The rulers should depend on the will of those who are under their heels. Thus, they have to be servants of the people, ready to do their will." (188).

A: "Independence must begin at the bottom. Thus, every village will be a republic or *panchayat* having full powers. It follows, therefore, that every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its affairs even to the extent of defending itself against the whole world. It follows, therefore, that every village will be a republic or *panchayat* having full powers." (188-189).

Here, it is the individual who is the unit. "The society must naturally be based on truth and non-violence which, in my opinion, are not possible without a living belief in God, meaning a self-existent, all-knowing living Force which inheres in every other force known to the world..." (189)

title: 189
"In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Life will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual always ready to perish for the village, the latter ready to perish for the circle of villages, till at last the whole becomes one life composed of individuals, never aggressive in their arrogance but ever humble, sharing the majesty of the oceanic circle of which they are integral units."

The outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle and give power within.

Q: Do you believe that the proposed Constituent Assembly could be used for the realisation of your picture.

A: "If India is to be a leader in clean action based on clean thought, God will confound the wisdom of these big men and will provide the villages with the power to express themselves as they should." (190)

Q: If the Constituent Assembly fizzles out because of the 'danger from within' - what is your alternative in that eventuality?

A: "I must not contemplate darkness before it stares me in the face ... I know that the actuality will find me ready with an alternative. My sole reliance being on the living Power which we call God. He will put the alternative in my hands when the time has come, not a minute sooner." (191).
