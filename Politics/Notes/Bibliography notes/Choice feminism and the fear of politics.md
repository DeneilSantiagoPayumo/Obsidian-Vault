# Choice Feminism and the Fear of Politics
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Choice feminism is motivated by a fear of politics. It arises in response to three common criticisms of feminism: that feminism is too radical, too exclusionary, and too judgmental. In response, choice feminism offers a worldview that does not challenge the status quo, that promises to include all women regardless of their choices, and that abstains from judgment altogether. Moreover, it enables feminists to sidestep the difficulties of making the personal political: making judgments and demanding change of friends, family, and lovers. Yet judgment, exclusion, and calls for change are unavoidable parts of politics. If feminists are not to withdraw from political life altogether, we have to acknowledge the difficulty of engaging in politics. Political claims are partial; we will inevitably exclude, offend, or alienate some of those whom we should wish to have as allies. The political concerns and dilemmas to which choice feminism responds are very real. However, we can take seriously the political motivations behind choice feminism without withdrawing from politics. Instead, we need to complement an acknowledgment of the political dilemmas facing feminists with a celebration of the pleasures of engaging in politics with those who differ from and disagree with us.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Choice Feminism

Choice feminism has three important figures: (249)
1. First, it understands freedom as the capacity to make individual choices, and oppression as the inability to choose. Consequently, as long as a woman can say that she has chosen to do something, it is considered by choice feminists to be an expression of her liberation.
2. Second, since the only criterion for evaluating women's freedom is evaluating women's freedom is individual choice, we should abstain from judging the content of the choices women make. It is definitionally impossible for a woman to choose her own oppression; al choices she makes are equally expressions of her freedom, and therefore equally to be supported.
3. Finally, this view of freedom is supported by a particular historical narrative: it is the women's movement in the past that has made it possible for women to make free choices in the past.

It is a response to criticism that Feminism is too radical and judgemental, which induces a fear of politics, aimed at avoiding making choices and stands, and to de-radicalize feminist claims.

#### The Allure of Choice Feminism

It is a response to three criticisms of Feminism:
1. Feminism is too radical (they demand too much of us! Instead, Feminist demands are minimal, just keep a political consciousness.)
2. Feminists are exclusionary (American feminists are only concerned about the rights and needs of white, middle class woman. Instead of women as united by a common identity, they are merely a "loose collection of individuals")
3. Feminists are judgemental (too anti-men, too anti-heterosexual...)

Hence, we come to Naomi Wolf - advocating "power feminism" or "Rebecca Walker" urging feminists to "avoid making judgements about people based on generalization and stereotypes."

Feminists too (not a list, made into one, 249):
1. Live in relationships with people who are sexist and anti-feminist, unknowing of the political character of their personal decisions or gone untouched by the women's movements.
2. Live in disjuncture around the political principles and personal lives: we know so many SAHMs and more.
3. We understand those we love and care about as making anti-feminist choices which understanding puts in jeopardy those same criticisms (gendered divison of labour, staying at home with your children, way you behave, sexist and homophobic goals, so on)
4. It demands a lot of us: should I wear lipstick, do dishes, take off from my career?

Choice feminism allows us to opt out of this dilemma, releasing us from the burden of judging close to us. Our peers can be excused, our older friends can be excused, it relieves us of the burden of being constantly feminist.

### The Fear of Political Freedom

This focus divorces choice from the broader institutional, political, historical and social contexts, affecting how our choices are shaped by patriarchy.

"Choice feminism fails to differentiate between those who can choose and those who cannot; analysis of how class, race, sexuality and power affects women's choices is often missing." (250) or that because choices are individual, they have no social consequences - "women are therefore relieved of responsibility for considering the broader implication of their decision." (250)

It shuts down from giving a public account, critical discussions, forming judgements, deters women from being active in politics. Perhaps then we should complement a celebration of diversity?

However, this move does not address the political drives behind choice feminism: "the drive to make feminism appeal to as many people as possible ... The problem is that - even complemented by a political consciousness - the turn to choice feminism is motivated by a *fear of politics* ... What is ultimately being expressed in a choice feminist position is a fantasy of a world without politics: a world in which we are never called upon to defend our views." (250)

This is the classic freedom of modern liberalism: what we need is the exercise of political freedom, not because of a conception of lack of choice. We need to be public, make hard judgements, express judgements and take risk. Making judgements, risks that people will be offended and get turned off Feminism is politics. It is not the same as being judgmental: "rather than inappropriately imposing personal standards on other people from without, the practice of judgement involves becoming aware that we make political claims within a world of others who are differently situated and who need to be persuaded of the validity of our claims." (251)

### Towards Taking Feminist Pleasure in Politics

It is difficult and demanding to be a feminist. We have to make difficult choices about which battles to fight.
Engaging in politics is risky, involving taking the risk of being rejected and ridiculed.
We need to be interested in politics to enable us to change it. (252).
