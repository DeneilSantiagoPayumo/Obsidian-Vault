[[Arendt and the The Human Condition]]
Richard J. Bernstein, Why read Hannah Arendt now (Cambridge: Polity, 2018), ‘Plurality, politics and public freedom’ and ‘The American revolution and the revolutionary spirit

### Plurality, politics and public freedom

The starting point for her thinking was her personal experience - she dwells on the horror of totalitarianism.

Let's consider: action, plurality, natality, speech, appearance, public space, public freedom, power, persuasion, and political judgement.

She distinguishes what she calls the *Vita Activa* (the active life) with the *Vita Conmtemplativa* (the contemplative life). She distinguishes three types of activity that comprise the former: labour, work, and action.

Labour is the type of activity that is required for human survival that helps satisfy their bodily needs.

Work is the type of activity involved in creating an artificial world where life can be stabilized - a world that has some durability and permanence.

Action is the only activity that takes place directly between human beings without an intermediary - it corresponds to the human condition of plurality. This plurality is *the* condition of all political life.

Let's talk about action. What does Arendt mean when she suggests that action corresponds to the human condition of plurality? Plurality signifies that each of us have a distinctive perspective on the world and we express this through communication. Action is the capacity to initiate and begin something new.

Action is grounded in natality - the new beginning in birth only comes about because the newcomer possesses the capacity to begin something anew, that is - acting. Natality underscores a 'second birth' whereby we bring about a new beginning. We do not act in isolation - we act in concert with our fellow humans and reveal who we are.

One original conception - that of public spaces. They do not exist naturally, they are artificially created by human beings. These are spaces in which we act, speak, form and test opinions - politics arises between human beings.

*What is freedom essay?*

She draws on the concept of isonomy, political equality. Political equality is essential for politics - we debate and act among our peers. Isonomy in Greek polis guaranteed equality since men by nature aren't equal and requires an artificial institution to make them equal. In the polis freedom exists only among political equals. The reason was that she understood freedom as manifest in human activities, only real when others realised them. A free man is only free in the presence of others.

She distinguishes between the philosophical problem of freedom which deals with the question of inward free will and the political idea of public worldly freedom - she argues public freedom existed long long before. The issue of free will emerged when public freedom began to disappear.

The reason to be of politics is freedom and its field of experience in action in the political realm - without a politically guaranteed public realm, freedom lacks the public space to make its appearance. She draws upon the characterization of public worldly freedom by the philosophers of the eighteenth century.

Public freedom is a positive worldly achievement that arises when a plurality of human beings act and debate in public spaces, share and test opinions and seek to persuade one another.

She distinguishes between public freedom from liberation - liberation is liberation *from* something or someone. The distinction that she draws between the two is important. Consider the 2003 intervention in Iraq. Liberation from oppressors may be a necessary condition for freedom but it is not sufficient for the achievement of public freedom.

Many liberal and libertarian thinkers identify freedom with negative liberty. We are free when we minimize coercion. Arendt's characterization of public freedom stands contrary.

*On Violence*

Arendt understood the traditional conception of power as being violence. She criticises these ideas: power and violence are not distinguishable; they are antithetical concepts. Where true politics reigns, there is rational persuasion, not violence. When violence reigns, it destroys power.

Power for her corresponds to the ability for humans to act in concert. Power is what makes acting in concert possible. Unlike strength, power is an attribute of the group.

The power of the group exists only as the group acts together - when political groups dissolve, their power disappears. When she speaks of someone 'in power' she refers to political leadership: the person in power does not rule over members of the group, he is empowered by them and they can withdraw their power from the person or group empowered.

Power for her is not vertical concept, it is a horizontal concept - it springs up and grows when a plurality of individuals act together and treat each other as equals.

Violence is inherently anti-political. It uses tools, weapons and technology to destroy power. When existing regimes lose their power, they resort to violence. But just as violence can destroy power, power can overwhelm violence: Gandhi and the civil rights, the movements that overthrow communist regime. This is nonviolent power.

In the real world, we find a combination of the two.

Let's discuss the role of persuasion of the two: Arendt stresses the connection between action and speech. The type of speech which is fundamental to politics is where we seek to persuade our human beings with whom we share a common world.

Persuasion involves free open debate and argument with our peers and the exercise of judgement.

*In her essay, The Crisis Of Culture...*

Arendt argues judgement is a distinctive mode of thinking that deals with particular situations in their particularity - something necessary for politics.

Judgement rests on potential agreement, a dialogue - judgement must liberate itself from 'subjective private conditions' and must transcend their limitations.

### The American revolution and the revolutionary spirit

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### The revolutionary element of the American revolution

For her, the most revolutionary element of the American Revolution is tied with the act of constituting, or the laws of the government that are constituted - where debate, deliberation, contesting and sharing of opinions take place. Here, this is where public freedom is manifested.

```ad-quote
"A constitution is not the act of government but of people constituting a government." (Arendt 1965b: 143).
```

```ad-quote
"The true objective power of the American Constitution was not to limit power but to create new power - not power over, but empowerment of a federal government. This, of course, was combined with the Bill of Rights, which was designed to limit the abuse of power by the new government. The American Constitution finally consolidated the power of the Revolution. The combination of limited government, separation of powers, balancing power between the states and an empowered federal government, was the unique achievement of the American Revolution." (36)
```

Violence here played no role in the creation of a new republic.

### The consequences of the ratification of the Constitution

There was a failure to remember and to understand conceptually what was distinctive about the revolutionary spirit, and a failure to provide it with a lasting political institution. The main problem for Arendt was how to create a stable and enduring political institution such that the public freedom and public happiness would be able to flourish. 

```ad-quote
"This perplexity, namely, that the principle of public freedom and public happiness without which no revolution would ever have come to pass should remain the privilege of the generation of founders." (Arendt 1965b: 235)
```

```ad-quote
"Only the representatives of the people, not the people themselves, had an opportunity to engage in those activities of 'expressing, discussing, and deciding' which in a positive sense are the activities of freedom' (Arendt 1965b: 238)"
```

### Other instances of the revolutionary spirit

Arendt's most enthusiastic and vivid description of the outbreak of the revolutionary spirit was with her essay on the Budapest uprising of 1956 - although it was crushed by Soviet tasks, it exhibited the experience of people acting together and creating their own public freedom.

```ad-quote
"The same organization which for a few days, or a few weeks or months, to follow their own political devices without a government (or a party program) imposed from above" (Arendt 1958a:497)

"The formation of a council in each disparate group turned a merely haphazard togetherness into a political institution" (Arendt 1958b: 500)
```
