>This essay examines Hannah Arendt’s treatment of science and technology in her work during the 1950s and early 1960s. As scientific research acquired prominence in the United States and Germany after the Second World War, its public meaning was shaped by geopolitics and fears about nuclear weapons and the uncontrollable nature of technological development. A detailed exploration of the development of Arendt’s thought in this context has not been undertaken before. This essay refines our understanding of Arendt’s relationship with familiar interlocutors such as Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger, and challenges readings that concentrate narrowly on her analysis of totalitarianism as a reference point for understanding her thought.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Treatment of the connection between totalitarianism and science in the wider context of German discourses on technology (Science, totalitarianism, labour)

In the last section of the book, Arendt narrated the rise of 'earth alienation' which had led humanity to view the earth from an 'Archimedean point' situated beyond it. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had seen a qualitative shift from a 'natural' science that exploited natural forces to a universal science that channelled cosmic forces into nature, rendering obsolete previous understandings of the relationship between the natural and human world.

For Arendt, she argued that natural sciences have eroded faith in divine revelation, grounding the need for politics that generates meaning for people without relying on theology - politics thereof was closely linked to scientific change.

Biological understandings of humanity are a central feature of totalitarian imaginary and a major threat to political culture - emphasising natural laws and less on the field of biology. Universal laws applicable to social organization are a key feature of totalitarian ideology.

She argued that totalitarian regimes saw themselves as harmonizing positive and natural law to allow the laws of race or class to transform humanity into an 'active unfailing carrier of a law to which human beings otherwise would only passively and reluctantly be subjected' (Arendt, 1953:30), totalitarianism destroying the norms and institutions sustaining the 'world.' 

**Her interpretation of Marx** could be conceived of in two planks: first, that Marx conceived of man as a labouring animal, naturalizing human history and attributing to it the devoluntarizing aspects of evolutionary science. Second,, Marx combined his view of history with a quasi-Platonic and humanist concept of instrumental action on nature, lauding the capacity of humanity to direct the course of history, treating history simultaneously as nature and akin to the domination of nature.

This is an anti-humanist concept of labour combined with a humanist concept of work.

One outcome of the changes that Marx conceptualized was an 'end of history' terminating in the technocratic management. Arendt occupied herself with the idea of automation.

"The product of nineteenth-century social and economic development, she argued, the social precipitated the decline of public spheres and republican values in favour of a vision of politics as the management of the 'national household.'" (1998: 38-39,44) ... "In presaging the reduction of humans 'to the level of a conditioned and behaving animal', the behavioural sciences were ideally suited to the devolution of government to 'pure administration', a process that had been gathering pace since the development of the bureaucratic national welfare state (1998: 45, 322)."

Without a higher source of meaning, technology and industrial modernity engendered mass societies dominated by the individual and collective instrumental pursuit of interests, with the spare time of the working individual 'never spent in anything but consumption' which could lead to the "grave danger that eventually no object of the world will be safe from consumption and annihilation through consumption" (1998: 133). 
### Her development during the 1950s of the notion of earth alienation (The question of technology)

Arendt argued that though European fears about American power were misdirected, they were indicators of wider historical change - the process which Europeans dread as "Americanization" was rather the "emergence of the modern world with all its perplexities and implications" with the central problem of the contemporary world being in the political organisation of mass societies and the political integration of technical power. 

Historicity, Arendt argued, linked insights into the temporally bound 'structures of human life' to historical change without subordinating either to the revelation of a Hegelian absolute. Heidegger was 'highly sensitive to the general trends of time'. This is a problem as Historicity neglects the centre of politics - man as an acting being.

Arendt was careful to distinguish between earth and world alienation. The Human Condition was swamped with details on how these places have become overcome by large-scale social and economic processes. Arendt's conception of 'earth' - devoid of connotations of place, dwelling or homeliness reflected a wariness of valorising blood and soil, eliding the distinction between the human and the natural.

Arendt also described two other forms of alienation - inner and world alienation. World alienation, saw peasant and church lands sucked into globalising markets and were grounded in in repetitive processes of labour that undermined the stability of the human world by absorbing worldly objects into cycles of production.

Inner alienation Arendt drew from 'terrestrial proximity' that put a decisive distance between man and earth. This was estrangement from the natural and human world rather than Marxian alienation from the product of one's labour. Inner and world alienation encouraged a flight into the subjectivity of the individual that was once protected by the private realm.

For Arendt, events were constellations of human acts and unpredictable consequences, capable of beginning chain of further events that allowed the identification of an 'unbroken continuity' in which precedents exist - Arendt uses the French Revolution as an example of a quintessential modern event, Earth alienation revolutionized man's relationship with nature and the world through scientific action.

The biggest change wrought by these developments - a shift from natural to a 'universal science', the erosion of geocentricism allowing the circumvention of the sensory limitations of the body, enabling the observation and explanation of nature as if from an 'Archimedean point' located outside the earth. That is to be Earth alienation - a rejection of aspects of the human condition that entailed humans being earthbound.

### How and why she drew on the reflections of philosophers of science (Nuclear power: the bomb that will bring us together, [[Martin Heidegger]])

For Arendt, the bomb betokened an 'atomic era' of wider import - by reducing the need for labour, atomic energy may accelerate processes leading to the 'superfluity' of individuals who may succumb to 'rage at a liberation that destroyed thee traditional ways of work and life.' Despite that, she believed that the bomb might transform the individual man into a conscious member of the human race. "If totalitarian attempts at world domination had brought about the recognition of a common humanity, the bomb might turn individuals into universal beings forced to view the political world from the perspective of mankind."

"Modern philosophy undermined the possibility of a freely roving 'common sense' that could stabilize political interaction (Arendt, 1998: 280-3)." The tendency arose from a transition from speculative to experimental science. "Common sense no longer referred to the relationship of private senses to a shared world but to a shared structure of mind."

"Science and politics were unable to communicate with one another, not because of inadequate public education, but due to the character of modern science. This was a dangerous problem because through organization, scientists had long generated the power to act collectively to set off unpredictable processes that traversed the human and the natural world."

Drawing on European and North American sources in the philosophy of science and popularizations by theoretical physicists, and combining technical and intellectual events, Arendt’s depiction of scientific change was not wholly reductive. Nevertheless, it was synoptic and selective, anachronistically reading developments in modern physics – especially Einstein’s theory of relativity – into early modern science. Focusing on a few key events and phenomena such as the invention of the telescope and mathematization, she used what one critic of anti-positivism has referred to as a ‘block representation’ of science, presenting scientific development as a series of revolutions and radical breaks ([Galison, 1997](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr57-0047244114532220): 793). After Kuhn, her treatment of the evolution of science appears dated ([Kuhn, 1962](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr79-0047244114532220)). Nevertheless, categorizing her simply as another continental anti-positivist critic of science does not do justice to her interest in scientific discourse, and misses important differences between her approach and that of her contemporaries.

An overwhelming emphasis on Arendt’s theory of totalitarianism as a reference point for her writings from the 1950s has marginalized the connections she drew between science, history and human activity, and obscured significant elements of her treatment of action.[31](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#fn31-0047244114532220) The narrative of the history of science and technology she sketched in _The Human Condition_ and elsewhere hinged on a series of contrasts: between the human artifice and earth alienation, language and mathematization, and action within bounds and unreflective Promethean endeavour. Since the early modern period, she suggested, the ways in which humans conceived action had been shaped by the standpoint of earth alienation provided by science, furnishing a faith in the instrumental manipulation of nature and human phenomena alike. Her history of science was part of a history of the changing forms of human action, skipping from the ancient world to the seventeenth century and then to modern physics and atomic science. From Galileo and Newton to space engineers and cyberneticians, scientific and technological advances had allowed man to act into nature from an alienated standpoint, setting off unpredictable processes that destabilized the world ([Arendt, 1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr18-0047244114532220): 52). An understanding of the history behind these developments, she suggested, was essential to interpreting the prospects for political action. Arendt was not concerned solely with undermining positivist treatments of science as a manifestation of human autonomy and rationality, nor with the social-scientific suppression of politics. She hoped to discern shifts within scientific research that might encourage non-instrumental and reflexive approaches to both politics and nature.

As this essay has suggested, Arendt’s narrative of the history of science and technology cannot be explained satisfactorily through her theory of totalitarianism. It was fundamentally directed at Western societies, and specifically against the calculative forms of understanding cultivated by the behavioural sciences and analytical philosophy, whose rise she was seeking to historicize. On the surface, her views of technology had much in common with those expressed by Max Horkheimer and Adorno in _Dialektik der Aufklärung_ ([Adorno, 1947](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr1-0047244114532220)). However, rather than treating the heteronomy and instrumentality of science through the unfolding dialectic of reason, she separated reason from scientific development, instead constructing her analysis of the historical relationship between man and nature in terms of contingent events such as the invention of the telescope, and on the more ambivalent grounds of her history of action. Her attempt to rehabilitate an idiosyncratic but nevertheless humanist category of action, together with her commitment to deal with the history of science not only in terms of philosophy but practical technical development, also indicates that she was doing something quite different from Heidegger, the Frankfurt School and Karl Jaspers. An emphasis on action mitigated the Weberian pessimism of her treatment of the irreversibility of technological conditioning. Despite suggesting that the combination of technology and economic processes might lead to ‘the deadliest, most sterile passivity history has ever known’, she was also keen to stress that these changes did not ‘mean that modern man has lost his capacities or is on the point of losing them’ ([Arendt, 1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr18-0047244114532220): 322–3).

The connections between humanism, science and secularization illuminate themes in Arendt’s thought that have recently begun to attract scholarly attention.[32](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#fn32-0047244114532220) She avoided the pitfalls of teleological rationalization and modernization theories in viewing secularization as engendered by a combination of action and the confirmation technological innovations provided for scientific discoveries. This allowed her to explore the political implications of the constitution of the modern secular world in innovative ways not only in _The Human Condition_, but also in _Between Past and Future_ (1961) and _On Revolution_ (1963) ([Arendt, 2006a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr32-0047244114532220): 91–143; [Arendt, 1990](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr17-0047244114532220): 25–7, 101–4). While noting that world alienation and the resulting ‘worldlessness’ of atomized individuals could be superficially connected to Christian otherworldliness, she described the former as radically different in origin, and therefore character, from the latter. Only with the addition of the mathematization of time and space begun by physics, she argued, did this secular consciousness fully develop. One of the forms in which it manifested itself was the quasi-scientific and instrumental understanding of nature and history found in totalitarian ideology.

The themes of science and technology in Arendt’s work in the 1950s therefore help place her in the midst of post-war debates about humanism and post-humanism. In her emphasis on action and the possibility of overcoming instrumentality through a reading of modern physics, she was less pessimistic than another student of Heidegger’s, Karl Löwith, who took an almost cosmological perspective on the problems of anthropocentrism and historical development.[33](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#fn33-0047244114532220) At the same time, the significance Arendt invested in the ‘Archimedean point’ shows the extent to which she thought technology dangerously accentuated the Roman assumption ‘that man is the highest being we know of’ ([Arendt, 2006c](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr34-0047244114532220): 260). However, as her response to the question, ‘Has man’s conquest of space increased or diminished his stature?’ posed by the journal for which she wrote ‘The conquest of space and the stature of man’ (1963), suggests, Arendt was still fundamentally concerned with the rehabilitation of a chastened form of humanism ([Arendt, 2006c](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0047244114532220#bibr34-0047244114532220)). Her claims about the dignity of the human were tied to the fate of action, understood historically, in an increasingly ‘worldless’ world. Arendt drew together the epistemological practices of the free and unfree world in a global process that suggested that spaces for political freedom were shrinking in Western democracies as much as in the communist bloc. Science and technology, entangled with secularization, were central components of this narrative.
