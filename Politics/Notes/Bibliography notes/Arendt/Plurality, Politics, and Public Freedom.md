[[Arendt and the The Human Condition]]

The starting point for her thinking was her personal experience - she dwells on the horror of totalitarianism.

Let's consider: action, plurality, natality, speech, appearance, public space, public freedom, power, persuasion, and political judgement.

She distinguishes what she calls the *Vita Activa* (the active life) with the *Vita Conmtemplativa* (the contemplative life). She distinguishes three types of activity that comprise the former: labour, work, and action.

Labour is the type of activity that is required for human survival that helps satisfy their bodily needs.

Work is the type of activity involved in creating an artificial world where life can be stabilized - a world that has some durability and permanence.

Action is the only activity that takes place directly between human beings without an intermediary - it corresponds to the human condition of plurality. This plurality is *the* condition of all political life.

Let's talk about action. What does Arendt mean when she suggests that action corresponds to the human condition of plurality? Plurality signifies that each of us have a distinctive perspective on the world and we express this through communication. Action is the capacity to initiate and begin something new.

Action is grounded in natality - the new beginning in birth only comes about because the newcomer possesses the capacity to begin something anew, that is - acting. Natality underscores a 'second birth' whereby we bring about a new beginning. We do not act in isolation - we act in concert with our fellow humans and reveal who we are.

One original conception - that of public spaces. They do not exist naturally, they are artificially created by human beings. These are spaces in which we act, speak, form and test opinions - politics arises between human beings.

*What is freedom essay?*

She draws on the concept of isonomy, political equality. Political equality is essential for politics - we debate and act among our peers. Isonomy in Greek polis guaranteed equality since men by nature aren't equal and requires an artificial institution to make them equal. In the polis freedom exists only among political equals. The reason was that she understood freedom as manifest in human activities, only real when others realised them. A free man is only free in the presence of others.

She distinguishes between the philosophical problem of freedom which deals with the question of inward free will and the political idea of public worldly freedom - she argues public freedom existed long long before. The issue of free will emerged when public freedom began to disappear.

The reason to be of politics is freedom and its field of experience in action in the political realm - without a politically guaranteed public realm, freedom lacks the public space to make its appearance. She draws upon the characterization of public worldly freedom by the philosophers of the eighteenth century.

Public freedom is a positive worldly achievement that arises when a plurality of human beings act and debate in public spaces, share and test opinions and seek to persuade one another.

She distinguishes between public freedom from liberation - liberation is liberation *from* something or someone. The distinction that she draws between the two is important. Consider the 2003 intervention in Iraq. Liberation from oppressors may be a necessary condition for freedom but it is not sufficient for the achievement of public freedom.

Many liberal and libertarian thinkers identify freedom with negative liberty. We are free when we minimize coercion. Arendt's characterization of public freedom stands contrary.

*On Violence*

Arendt understood the traditional conception of power as being violence. She criticises these ideas: power and violence are not distinguishable; they are antithetical concepts. Where true politics reigns, there is rational persuasion, not violence. When violence reigns, it destroys power.

Power for her corresponds to the ability for humans to act in concert. Power is what makes acting in concert possible. Unlike strength, power is an attribute of the group.

The power of the group exists only as the group acts together - when political groups dissolve, their power disappears. When she speaks of someone 'in power' she refers to political leadership: the person in power does not rule over members of the group, he is empowered by them and they can withdraw their power from the person or group empowered.

Power for her is not vertical concept, it is a horizontal concept - it springs up and grows when a plurality of individuals act together and treat each other as equals.

Violence is inherently anti-political. It uses tools, weapons and technology to destroy power. When existing regimes lose their power, they resort to violence. But just as violence can destroy power, power can overwhelm violence: Gandhi and the civil rights, the movements that overthrow communist regime. This is nonviolent power.

In the real world, we find a combination of the two.

Let's discuss the role of persuasion of the two: Arendt stresses the connection between action and speech. The type of speech which is fundamental to politics is where we seek to persuade our human beings with whom we share a common world.

Persuasion involves free open debate and argument with our peers and the exercise of judgement.

*In her essay, The Crisis Of Culture...*

Arendt argues judgement is a distinctive mode of thinking that deals with particular situations in their particularity - something necessary for politics.

Judgement rests on potential agreement, a dialogue - judgement must liberate itself from 'subjective private conditions' and must transcend their limitations.
