Upon publication of her “field manual,” _The Origins of Totalitarianism_,_in 1951, Hannah Arendt immediately gained recognition as a major political analyst. Over the next twenty-five years, she wrote ten more books and developed a set of ideas that profoundly influenced the way America and Europe addressed the central questions and dilemmas of World War II. In this concise book, Elisabeth Young-Bruehl introduces her mentor’s work to twenty-first-century readers. Arendt’s ideas, as much today as in her own lifetime, illuminate those issues that perplex us, such as totalitarianism, terrorism, globalization, war, and “radical evil.”  
  
## A summary of the book:

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### What elements can preserve freedom or help people achieve freedom?

Three activities are fundamental for humans: labour, work, and action - each corresponds to a universal and basic condition.

"The human condition of labour is life itself" - people must labour to supply themselves with the necessities of food and safety that sustain life.
"The human condition of work is worldliness" - people must build a world in which they can inhabit and cultivate to develop culture.
"Plurality is the condition of human actions" - as no two human beings are alike, people must relate to one another and live together, negotiate their differences and so on.

"When the contemplative live is privileged over the active life (the vita activa), action is especially distrusted. Contemplatives want to control or eliminate the uncontrolled, unpredictable realm of action and speech, the political realm." (83)

Arendt's point is that there are two fundamental types of thinking about politics - thinking of it as a government with dominion over people using the threat or use of violence, or as she does, an organization or constitution of the power people have when they come together as talking and acting beings.

"Her fear was that self-preoccupation in any form would lead to the modern version of contemptus mundi, which she called world-alienation" (85)

### Action

Action is related to natality - "the new beginning inherent in birth can make itself felt in the world only because the newcomer possesses the capacity of beginning something anew, that is, of acting."

Action is open to all people, and requires no special talents as it arises from the human condition of natality - action is initiation, characterized by its novelty. Action reveals *who* a person is.

Action is different from behaviour, which is repetitive and habitual, showing what people have become and not who they can become in the performance of action which forces them to rise. Action can only be judged for its performance, and the only criteria - greatness.

Action is intimately bound to mortality - human beings make works that they hope will be immortal and address the inevitability of mortality, passing down human deeds and words. Whilst action reveals who actors are, and make them the subjects of stories, there are big frustrations or hazards that action poses to human beings: "the chief hazard of action is that it has effects that are uncontrollable, unstoppable, and unpredictable." (88)

Action can't be understood until actors have exited the stage - they do not know the consequences of their actions. When people try to imagine acting and to determine its story in advance, they are governed by visions of ends to be achieved and means to those ends, conceptualizing action in terms of work - "you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs"

Action is threatened when people do not understand the way it generates power. Under modern, post-totalitarian conditions, there exists one singular threat to action - society itself, with its mechanization, commodification, promotion of social conformism and thoughtlessness that created an equal threat.

### Power and forgiveness

Arendt conceptualizes power on 'people coming together to share words and deeds.' Here, power and violence are polar opposites - an argument for power, which is most powerful when it is nonviolent.

The distinction between power and violence is hard to appreciate when violence has already been resorted to - under contemporary conditions, 'victory' persuades people that violence is power but such victory means that the victor resorted to violence from lack of power, that it was unwilling to find a nonviolent way to deal with enemies. Only lasting power is power that arises from nonviolent actions - continuing discussion and a respectful exchange of opinions.

"Arendt's faith in the power of the people rests on a conviction that people fundamentally desire the "public happiness" that comes from acting in concert, bonding together for their common good." (92)

Arendt heavily dislikes [[Thomas Hobbes]] - when a republic goes to his vision, it is headed for tyranny rationalized as sovereignty.

Two forms of action that deeply address the uncertainty and risk of action in general - promises and forgiveness.

Forgiveness is the human faculty for undoing - reversing - deeds and words that have been done and spoken - "forgiveness is the necessary corrective for inevitable damages resulting from action.". Forgiveness addresses the happenings of the past while the human capacity to make promises addresses the unpredictability of action.

Forgiveness here does not relate to repetitive daily behaviours judged by criteria of right or wrong - one does not forgive a deed, but the doer of a deed. Forgiveness is not of the traditional moral domain - in the philosophical tradition, morality is thought to flow out from a well-ordered ruler or ruling group. With her, the domain of action is the domain of plurality: experiences with others determine the moral ambiance for forgiving and promising.

Forgiveness does not relate to "the extremities of crime and willed evil" - human deeds considered most challenging to forgive. A person who goes astray and here "trespasses" differs from one who knowingly commits offences. The only alternative to forgiveness is rather punishment, very different from taking vengeance - vengeance re-enacts the original trespass and perpetuates the cycle of damages that carry on henceforth.

"Arendt, in effect, ruled out of her political consideration unconditional forgiveness ... and the unconditional love on which it is based as phenomena too rare to have political meaning or political implications." (105) For more examples, see Eichmann - someone who 'violated the fundamental order of the human condition'.

### Technology

"Actions can be obscured by a philosophical prejudice against it and all but eliminated by state domination of the people, in tyrannical, authoritarian, or totalitarian governments. But action can also be threatened when labour and work become so dominant in the vita activa that action has no place, its relative absence hardly noticed by those who think about politics only in terms suitable for labour and work, and who glorify the relentless progress of the consumer-technological society." (150)

Society is moving in a paradoxical manner: because of technological progress, many labourers were being liberated from the gruelling, mind-numbing forms of labour typical of the industrial revolution. They were not being liberated from the mindset of labouring, or the possibility of engaging in higher forms - they are all "making a living", doing what they think of as supplying necessities. People who are "making a living" cannot distinguish themselves in freedom as they are really only doing a job. 

"A bureaucracy is a good place to become a thoughtless person, but any job will do as long as the person doing it is only doing a job." (151) Many scientific creators of technology are also just doing their job, and don't think about what they're doing - 

"if it should turn out to be true that knowledge ... and thought have parted company for good, then we would indeed become the helpless slave, not so much of our machines as of our know-how, thoughtless creatures at the mercy of every gadget which is technically possible, no matter how murderous." (152)

"The politicians of deteriorating republics are, she thought, people who are doing their jobs and treating political decision making as if it were scientific calculation or application of theory." (153) With totalitarianism, image-selling and terror and lying intrude criminality into politics - selling an image of security and protection that people pay with with their own power.
