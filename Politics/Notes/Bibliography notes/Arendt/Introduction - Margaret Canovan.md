[[Arendt and the The Human Condition]]

viii

She repudiates the title of the political philosopher - she argues that the mistake has been to ignore that ignore that politics goes among *plural* human beings, each of whom can act and start something new. The results that emerge must be discussed.

We must separate action conceptually from other human activities with which it is usually confounded - the most organizing principle lies in its three forms of activity, labour, which corresponds to the biological life of man as an animal, work, which corresponds to the artificial world of objects that human beings build upon this earth and action, that corresponds to our plurality as distinct individuals.

There is more to the book than the phenomenological analysis.

She starts by discussing the Hungarian empire to automation - seen as causing unemployment.

To understand political action as *making* something is a dangerous mistake - making is something a craftsman does by forcing raw material to conform to his model. Neither do human beings nor does raw material have a say in the process. To conceive of politics as making is to ignore human plurality in theory and to coerce individuals in practice.

Arendt claims [[Karl Marx]] firstly did not understand this, and secondly understood history in terms of processes of production and consumption - a collective life-process of a species. She found him a revealing representation of modern society in which economic concerns have come to dominate both politics and human self-consciousness.

She accounts for a 'laborers society' - what is the social?

Its theme is the main dangers of action, setting off new processes beyond the actors' control including the processes that have given rise to modern society. Her analysis of the human condition is the vital importance for civilized existence of a durable human world, built upon the earth to shield us against natural processes and provide a stable setting.

The main threat to the human world is the economic modernization that destroyed all stability and set everything in motion - Arendt traces this to the unintended effects of contingent human actions, the expropriation for ecclesiastical and peasant property carried out in the course of the Reformation.

Property has been the chief bastion of the civilized world, giving owners an interest in maintaining its stability - peasants with a stake in the stability of the world were turned into day laborers entirely absorbed in the struggle to satisfy their needs.

Stable property was converted into fluid wealth - capital. Instead of inhabiting a stable world of objects made to last, human beings found themselves sucked into an accelerating process of production and consumption.

This modern artificiality is quite unlike the stable worldly artifice inhabited by earlier civilizations - objects and houses have become items of consumption, while automatic production processes have taken on a quasi-natural rhythm to which human beings have had to adjust themselves.

She describes this as an unnatural growth of the natural - modernization has turned out to be good at increasing production, consumption, and procreation giving rise to a vastly expanded human race. These economic concerns are the centre of public attention and public policy - the cost has been the devastation of the world and an increasing tendency for human human beings to conceive of themselves in terms of their desire to consume.

For this modern hegemony of labouring, science and technology have become the arena for action into nature. When men are becoming more and more inclined to think of themselves as an animal species, their ability to transcend such limits was being revealed by scientific intervention.

Arendt argues that men have found ways of looking at the earth from a cosmic perspective and have challenged natural limits to the point of threatening the future of life itself. According to her diagnosis of the predicament, Promethean powers are being exercised in a society of beings too absorbed in consumption to take any responsibility for the human world to understand their political capacities - thoughtlessness is among the outstanding characteristic of our time.

Arendt's account of the human condition reminds us that human beings are creatures who act in the sense of starting things and setting off trains of events - something we go on doing whether we understand the implications, with the result that both the human world and the earth have been devastated by our self-inflicted catastrophises.

She diagnoses a paradoxical situation in which radical economic processes were set off by human action while those concerned increasingly thought of themselves as helpless flotsam on the currents of socioeconomic forces.

Both trends focused public attention on economic activities that were once linked with focusing of private action.

We need to listen what she is doing - it is not that we should rise from our torpor and take charge of events. There is no humanity that could take responsibility in this way: human beings are plural and mortal and this gives politics its miraculous openness and contingency.

It is the reminder of human natality and the miracle of beginning - Arendt argues that faith and hope in huma affairs come from the fact that new people are coming into the world, each of them unique and able to influence events. Power can spring up from nowhere when people act in concert.

It carries warning - a lack of control over its effects. Action sets things in motion but cannot foresee the effects of one's own initiatives. Action is frustrating - its results are different from what the actor intended.

Arendt observes that there are some remedies for the predicaments of action but she stresses this limited reach - taking further action to interrupt apparently inexorable processes but that does not make safe the unpredictable future. Only the human capacity to forgive can deal with this. This breaking of the chain of action works only for human condition.

We can also make promises - plural people can create contracts.

We are not helpless animals, we can engage in action, take initiatives, try to bring them under control to interrupt such processes - she reminds us the problems caused by pluraltiy.
