# Reflections on Gandhi
## Article Introduction

To what extent was Gandhi moved by vanity - a humble, naked old man - and to what extent did he compromise his own principles by entering politics which are inseparable from coercion and fraud?

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Orwell encounters the bibliography

"But one should, I think, realize that Gandhi's teachings cannot be squared squared with the belief that Man is the measure of all things and that our job is to make life worth living on this earth, which is the earth only we have." It only makes sense if God exists and a world of materialism is an illusion to escape from. It's worth considering the disciplines Gandhi imposed on him and his workers:

1. "No meat-eating, and if possible no animal food in any form. No alcohol or tobacco, and no spices or condiments even of a vegetable kind, since food should be taken not for its own sake but solely in order to preserve one's strength.
2. Secondly, if possible, no sexual intercourse. If sexual intercourse must happen, then it should be for the sole purpose of begetting children and presumably at long intervals ...
3. And finally - this is the cardinal point - for the seeker after goodness there must be no close friendships and no exclusive loves whatsoever."

### Friendships and Pacifism.

"Close friendships, Gandhi says, are dangerous, because "friends react on one another" and through loyalty to a friend one can be led into wrong-doing ... Moreover, if one is to love God, or to love humanity as a whole, one cannot give one's preference to any individual person."

Gandhi even remarked that eating animal food was a mortal sin, and was willing to let his wife or a child die than eat the animal food.

"This attitude is a noble one, but, in the sense which - I think - most people would give to the word, it is inhuman. The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other human individuals."

"Sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid ... If one could follow it to its psychological roots, one would, I believe, find that the main motive for "non-attachment" is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work ... The point is that they are incompatible.

Gandhi's pacificism is a technique capable of producing desired political results. Satyagraha involved a way of defeating the enemy without feeling or arousing hatred, entailing civil disobedience, strikes and more. Gandhi was asked a question on the question of the Jews in 1938 - that German Jews ought to commit collective suicide, which "would have aroused the world and the people of Germany to Hitler's campaign."

"After the war he justified himself: the Jews had been killed anyway, and might as well have died significantly. ... Gandhi was merely being honest. If you are not prepared to take life, you must often be prepared for lives to be lost in some other way." 

### Did Gandhi not understand the nature of totalitarianism?

"The important point here is not so much that the British treated him forbearingly as that he was always able to command publicity ... It is difficult to see how Gandhi's methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the regime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard again. Without a free press and the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary."

Can non-violent resistance even be effective against one's own government, or against an occupying power? "Gandhi's various conflicting statements on the late war seem to show that he felt the difficulty of this. Applied to foreign politics, pacifism either stops being pacifist or becomes appeasement."

"On the other hand, this was done by a Labour government, and it is certain that a Conservative government, especially a government headed by Churchill, would have acted differently. But if, by 1945, there had grown up in Britain a large body of opinion sympathetic to Indian independence, how far was this due to Gandhi's personal influence? And if, as may happen, India and Britain finally settle down into a decent and friendly relationship, will this be partly because Gandhi, by keeping up his struggle obstinately and without hatred, disinfected the political air?"
