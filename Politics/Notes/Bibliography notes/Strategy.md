# CHAPTER 23| The Power of Nonviolence
## Article Introduction

The strength of strategies on how to influence public opinion depended on moving elites along with the public.

The campaign in Britain stretched from proposals to include women's suffrage in the Reform Act of 1867 to the Equal Franchise Act of 1928.

The militancy developed as a result of progressive disillusion, first with the Liberal Party reluctance to honour its ideals, then which the lack of priority given to women by the labour movement, and a growing conviction that legislative routes were being exhausted. The core themes were derived from classic liberal ideas - opposition to arbitrary power that resulted in individuals having obligations but no rights.

The American suffragette movement, which achieved its goal in 1920, was far less militant - there was a close link with the progressive movement which pushed to the fore the stresses of industrialisation, poor women forced to work meagre wages.

The term for those who renounced all violence - pacifist. By stressing peace more than injustice meant that they were bound to the status quo, struck down with existing hierarchies of power and left either playing down grievances or claiming susceptibility to improbable remedies, love and reason.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The Impact of Gandhi

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] read [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Tolstoy]] which influenced his political beliefs - see [[Self-rule]].

```ad-quote
title: 347, then 348 (2) on *satyagraha*
Those who embraced this [satyagraha] philosophy had an inner strength giving them the courage and discipline to endure and overwhelm those who relied on violent means. He argued the inseparability of ends and means: violent methods could not deliver a peaceful society. Prison should embraced piously, assault cheerfully, and death peacefully. When he spoke he did so quietly, almost profeessorially, and never as a demagogue. All this was combined with a shrewed political sensibility. Gandhi had a gift for putting his opponents on the defensive, not only by claiming the moral high ground but also by identifying sisues which were particularly awkward for the British.

Gandhi's campaigns did not push the British out of India. They helped confirm, along with the strain resulting from the Second World War, that the subcontinent was just too large to be effectively controlled by a relatively small and distant state of declining authority and capacity. There was a nationalistic swell in Indian opinion that cannot be contained indefinitely. But while Gandhi's efforts did not by themselves make British rule impossible, they did turn his Congress Party into a credible alternative government to the Raj ... at a time of brutality and upheaval across the world, Gandhi stood out as a leader who personified dignity and goodness in the simplicity of his dress and diet, and in his spiritual message. At the same time, he managed to forge an authentic and successful mass movement ... his claim to be reaching out to the good in his opponents and the promise of reconciliation left open the possibility of compromise.

To argue that nonviolence would be invariably effective ignored the possibility of hard choices - the method acquired authority and dignity precisely because one possible outcome was extreme suffering and no political gain.

However, what if it doesn't work? Then non-violence means tolerating an even greater evil. "Nonviolence might work well with the British, who wished to avoid a violent struggle and could be embarrassed by displays of popular resistance, but Gandhi's conviction that his methods would work against the Nazis was barely credible." (ibid)

### The Potential of Nonviolence

Other sociologists and philosophers like [[W, E. B. Du Bois]] invited and received an article from Gandhi. Du Bois pointed out how tactics of fasting, public prayer, and self-sacrifice were alien to the United States but had been "bred into the very bone of India for more than three thousand years."

[[Richard Gregg]] was working as a lawyer on labour disputes eventually spoke to Gandhi - ""He sought to extricate pacifism "from the profitless atmosphere of emotional adjectives and of vague mysticism, futile protests and sentimentalism combined with confused thinking." Rather than stress the contrast with traditional military strategy, he urged his readers to see nonviolence as another type of weapon, an innovation in warfare that made is possible to struggle without killing." (352).

He described that non-violence resistance to violent attack could be a moral jiu-jitsu, causing the attacker to "lose his moral balance."

[[Reinhold Neibuhr]] concluded that nonviolence could not work - he saw it as supporting the status quo. "It is unwise to expect those who who benefitted from inequality and injustice to respond positively to reasonable requests for equality and justice." (353). For him, "though reason would dictate cooperation and nonviolence, unfortunately there was "no miracle by which men can achieve a rationality high enough to give them as vivid an understanding of general interests as of their own." (ibid).

Some means could be justified - a society's morality was different from an individual's because there was so much more at stake.

The next stage in his argument was to deny any rigid distinction between violent and nonviolent coercion - "as long as it enters the field of social and physical relations and places physical restraints upon the desires and activities of others, it is a form of physical coercion" (353-354) ... Even nonviolent actions could lead to hurt, like Gandhi's boycott of the British textiles.

### An American Gandhi?

May 1942 - the first organised civil rights sit-in in American history. A group of twenty eight people sat down at Jack Spratt Coffee House and any attempts to call the police on the blacks gained little sympathy.

[[Bayard Rustin]], who later became involved with [[Philip Randolph]] saw clearly how nonviolence could be made to work for blacks - he had picked up on how early mobilization for war increased the economic importance of back workers.

The main black organisation, the NAACP, was based in the North, lacked a mass organisation, and was barred from operating in some southern states on grounds of subversion ... (talking about Rosa Parks) ... A crisis was created for the bus company, which depended on blacks for up to three-quarters of its customers.

For those looking for lesson for direct action, three lessons are to be learnt:
1. The economic effects were as important as the political, in that respect the actions were coercive
2. The political effects grew as the boycott endured and the national and international media became more intrigued
3. Third, the harsher the local response, the more the campaign benefitted.

The immediate effect of the arrival of Richard Gregg and Rustin, Smiley and Harris Wofford, Martin Luther King's was that it made nonviolence a guiding principle.

"Rustin argued that nonviolence had to be unconditional, so there could be no guns, even if only for self-defence, let alone armed bodyguards. He also demonstrated how this could be turned to a tactical advantage, by persuading MIA leaders indicted by a grand jury for violating a state anti-boycott statute to dress smartly, smile broadly, and turn themselves in, thus depriving the arrests of gravity and intimidation." (358-359).

The bus boycott had undermined many of the stereotypes Negroes had about themselves and others had about them, that they lacked nerve and staying power. The boycott had “broken the spell.” Six lessons were listed from the struggle: the community could stick together and their leaders did not have to sell out; they need not be intimidated by threats and violence; the church was becoming militant; there was a new self-belief; the importance of economics was understood, as white businessmen were anxious about the loss of business; a “new and powerful weapon” had been discovered in nonviolence, strengthening the movement by facing violence without returning it. King used more or less the same lessons when he spoke in December 1956 after the favorable Supreme Court ruling.

Rustin noted the strategic benefi ts of a bus boycott. It had a clear purpose, economic impact, and was susceptible to direct action. Unlike other targets, such as integrated education, there was no “administrative machinery and legal maneuvering” to get in the way. The action required a “daily rededication” to the struggle and so raised community solidarity and pride, making “humble folk noble” and turning “fear into courage.” Notably it had depended upon “the most stable social institution in Negro culture—the Church.”   29     In early 1957, Rustin masterminded the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Each word was signifi cant. Southern meant “not national.” “Christian” refl ected the special role of the Church in the South (for whites as well as blacks) and incidentally undermined claims that the movement was communist. “Leadership Conference” eschewed a mass membership organization. The advantage of this formulation was to avoid a fi ght with the NAACP, a national organization, which considered itself best able to speak for blacks.

The demonstrations, he insisted, should not be deplored more than the conditions which stimulated them. The objective of nonviolent direct action was negotiation, but to achieve that it was necessary to “create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to so dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.

title: 364 - [[Martin Luther King]]'s campaign through economic pain
Inevitably, at this point the movement came to face the fact that political rights did not guarantee improvement in economic or social conditions. The vote did not feed the children or pay the rent, although it did make possible further forms of political activity that might help over time. But King’s campaign culminated not with black satisfaction but with frustration, as riots broke out in the inner cities. As King began to turn his attention to issues of poverty, the question was whether the methods that had brought political gains in the South and launched him to national prominence could work across the country on issues that were much more intractable. King had led a focused campaign with a clear set of objectives, working with communities he understood and with tactics that — once refined — served both to coerce local white establishments through economic pain and turn the media spotlight on to the iniquities of segregation by provoking their police forces into violence. The whites saw their local businesses being hurt by bus boycotts and city center mayhem. If they tried to suppress the movement with the methods that had served them well in the past, they alienated northern politicians and the media. If they held back, they had few options other than to find a new modus vivendi with blacks. The movement’s strategists could comfort themselves even as their people suffered harsh treatment that this played into their hands. So long as their people did not buckle under the pressure, the contrast between the dignity of the protestors and the brutality of the police created a stunning media spectacle. 
```

The challenge was to convince blacks that to gain the same rights as other Americans they had to work together and to develop a considerable local organisation.
