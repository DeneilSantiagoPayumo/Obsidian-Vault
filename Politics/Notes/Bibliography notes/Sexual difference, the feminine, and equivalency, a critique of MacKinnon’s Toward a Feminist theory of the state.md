# A critique:
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
She ultimately doe snot develop her program that argues for affirmative action. This is because she cannot develop her theory as difference as anything other than victimisation. We need a positive program instead. It's wrong to reduce women to the figure of victim.

This equivalent right do not erase sexual difference, but seeks to value feminine sexual difference. Mackinnon's own stance reflects the criticism that keeps the feminine from being valued. Also, the concept of freedom cannot be separated from the struggle from the devalorization of the feminine - it involves more than truth, but a constitution of what is meant to be.

"Simply put, I will argue that women's sexuality cannot be reduced to women's "sex" as sex has been currently defined ... it is just a masculine dream. Equivalent right challenges the idea that sexual difference can and shold be eradicated through the pretense that the human race is constituted as sex-neutral."

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Summary of Mackinnon's point, and contradictions

MacKinnon sees inequality as sexual - not focusing on social reality will limit feminism. The study of the construct of sexuality is how we get fucked.
Men seek their desire through us. Sexual difference is thus the consequence of this imposed sexuality. Thus, pornography is the means of which the state enforces the male viewpoint that silences women.

Law is not neutral but rather it reinforces the legitimacy of the male viewpoint. The myth itself then is a form of domination - liberal state argues for gender equality in the name of a legal person when in reality the social stratum of gender inequality remains the truth of woman's condition.

#### Contradictions

```ad-error
title: Contradiction 1: sexual difference (2256)
How can one incorporate the feminist point of view into the state if sexual difference is not recognized? More specifically, in MacKinnon's own terms, how could women provide the needed repair? If women as a gender are defined as victims, as fuckees, as voiceless, and if, as MacKinnon argues, the feminist "point of view" is an impossibility within our system of male dominance, then it would be impossible to provide the condition for repair. Thus, women, defined as we are by MacKinnon, cannot possibly play the role she allots to them.
```

```ad-error
title: Contradiction 2: error? (2256)
The second contradiction in MacKinnon's analysis is that she advocates a positive program of state intervention into gender arrangements, and yet her own political slogan, "Out now!," is, and must remain, negative.
```

```ad-summary
title: 2257
"Without the affirmation of femininity we cannot develop a concept of "positive" freedom for women which MacKinnon herself recognizes we need to rectify the inequality of women ... MacKinnon's analysis, in other words, can criticize the negative state, but she cannot successfully justify the move beyond it given her own repudiation of the feminine."
```

#### A critique of her conception of liberalism

Negative liberty is no longer a thing of liberal thinkers. Now, lots of thinkers adopt the perspective of positive liberty.

```ad-summary
title: 2261
If, under traditional doctrinal analysis, pornography is at the periphery of free speech and there is evidence that it perpetuates the legitimation of violence against women, while "suffering" to the pornography reader is limited, particularly if access is restricted and not banned, then "reasonableness" may demand time and place restrictions even before we have an adequate account of the relationship between gender hierarchy and the devalorization of the feminine "sex." This account is ultimately necessary if we are to justify the tip in the balance toward such restrictions.
```

#### A critique of her conception of Marxism

It can be criticised on three grounds:

```ad-quote
title: Criticism 1 of her theory (2262)
The first is related to the "pragmatic" and "postmodern"" critique of any attempt to develop an empiricist, positivist, or materialist account of women's situation that could claim, in any strong sense, to be scientific, if by scientific we mean "free" of the mediation of narration.49 MacKinnon does not recognize the status of her own analysis as a story, but rather as a materialist conceptualization of gender inequality. Such accounts are never just descriptions, but are always narrations that give meaning to reality. They can never be free of an evaluation of that reality, which is what gives the story its meaning and, in the case of law, its legal meaning. A classic example is "date rape."

In order to define a certain kind of sexual abuse to women as date rape, we have to rely on a seeming oxymoron: putting the idea of date with its implied concept of consent together with rape. The behavior may have always been there, but it took a different story, with a different evaluation of those acts such as locking a woman into a dorm room until she agreed to have sexto define this behavior as rape.
```

```ad-quote
title: Criticism 2 of her theory (2263)
The figure of Woman as victim is an important one, but it is not the only figure of the feminine. MacKinnon tells us a story, a profound story, and it is true, but only partially so. This is the second criticism of MacKinnon's Marxist transposition which can only understand women's "material" oppression through the reduction of feminine sexual difference to Woman as the fuckee.

As we have seen, for MacKinnon, having a "sex," particularly a feminine identity, cannot be separated from "having sex," and "having sex" cannot be separated from domination and sadomasochism.
```

```ad-quote
title: Criticism 3 of her theory (2263)
The third criticism, which is primarily political, is that despite the limits of Marxism as a "science," its emphasis on class, race, and national difference remains extremely important to a feminism that is always modified through its respect for difference and which continually allows new narrations of the feminine and how it is lived, experienced, and told. As Audre Lorde has succinctly argued:

*"By and large within the women's movement today, white women focus upon their oppression as women and ignore differences of race, sexual preference, class, and age. There is a pretense to homogeneity of experience covered by the word sisterhood that does not in fact exist."*

In other words, femininity, if it is not to fall into the erasure of race and class difference, must always be modified. Indeed, put even more strongly, the openness to modification through-or openness to modification by the "other woman" is what provides the very basis of feminism as an aspiration to an ethical relationship irreducible to a set of established rules or any currently accepted political slogan.
```

To summarise: feminism involves the repudiation of the feminine. For the author, "feminism demands the affirmation of feminine sexual difference and the challenge to women's *dereliction* which flow inevitably from the repudiation of the feminine."

For her, a feminist perspective is impossible as anything other than the recognition of the totalization of the masculine view point.

```ad-quote
title: 2266
For now I am operating within MacKinnon's own heterosexual framework, because given MacKinnon's analysis, that is the framework that defines social reality. I want to emphasize that given MacKinnon's repudiation of the feminine, there can only be the inescapable totality of male violence, the world of the "fuckees" and the "fuckors." "True love" between women is always blocked by the totality of an imposed pornographic heterosexual reality. As a result, the utopian vision of lesbianism developed by innumerable writers such as Cixous, Irigaray, and Wittig, is foreclosed. We are left instead with a disjuncture between sex and freedom.
```

```ad-quote
title: Author's conception of pornography (2270-71)
How can we more profoundly understand pornography as an offense to women under the story of gender hierarchy I have just developed? Pornography reinforces the very sexual shame that, as Galenson and others have shown, makes it difficult for women truly to find equality of capability and well-being. We can only truly understand pornography as an offense within a context that explains gender hierarchy as the basis of sexual shame. Pornography, in this most basic sense, is an offense because it reflects the devalorization of women's "sex." Pornography prevents women from feeling like equal members of the community because it reflects their "sex" in a way that no woman can affirm. Thus, the harm to women is understood to outweigh the claim of the man who desires that pornography be available to him free of any restrictions, particularly once we understand the idea that pornography is not only an offense to women, but also an insult to men.

...

Finally, it is important to recognize that the fear of the "wimp," the fear of losing the supposed all-powerful phallus, is so overwhelming because in the context of gender hierarchy the worst thing that can happen to a person is to become a "girl," or rather a "cunt.
```

Women are the castrated "Other".

### Towards a new theory?

```ad-quote
title:First, (2273)
Equivalent rights are not merely a means to help women become more like men in the name of promoting one species undivided by sexual difference. Equivalent rights do not have as their sole or even their main goal the creation of a space for women in a male world from which we have previously been shut out. Rather, they are designed to enable women to value the choices we make about our life and work without shame of our "sex." MacKinnon has criticized the patriarchal culture which imposes "forced sexual choices." Yet she fails to see that one of these forced sexual choices is the very repudiation of the feminine.
```

```ad-quote
title: Second, ibid
Ultimately, pornography amounts only to a compensatory fantasy to make up for fear of women, the "dark continent." I in no way want to deny that fear too often leads to cruelty. We see this in race relations as well as in relations between the sexes. But, when MacKinnon speaks of the all-powerful man-and of pornography as his vision and his desire-she accepts the psychical fantasy of macho compensation as truth. Who but a "wimp" would fantasize about sex with a woman in chains, tied, bound and gagged, so he would, in the most profound sense, not have to face her, let alone hear her?
```

```ad-quote
title: Third, 2275
Feminine flesh is not the same as masculine flesh. The right to bodily integrity is a right necessary for both sexes under the vision of equality of capability and well-being. But given the difference of our "sexual being," the right to bodily integrity does not mean the same rights, but rather the guarantee of its equivalent scope for both sexes. The right of abortion is most definitely necessary to guarantee bodily integrity for women. Rights should not be based on what men need for their well-being as sexual beings of the flesh, as if there were only one genre of the human species.
