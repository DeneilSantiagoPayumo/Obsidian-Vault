# Feminism and Liberalism Reconsidered: The Case of Catharine MacKinnon
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Much of contemporary feminist theory presents itself as radically opposed to liberalism. Certain claims made by Catharine MacKinnon have contributed significantly to this view. In this article, however, I argue that certain fundamental aspects of MacKinnon's work must be understood within a liberal framework, even as she challenges the epistemological assumptions that tend to inform liberal political theories. I highlight the ways in which MacKinnon makes use of several fundamental liberal tenets, such as the primacy of individual choice, and then consider how her work contributes to an ongoing discussion about the relevance of liberal theory to contemporary feminist concerns.

This article argues that most of MacKinnon's theory in her book [[Towards a Feminist theory of the state]] actually has liberal underpinnings.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### MacKinnon's Critique of Abstract Equality

First: formal equality is inadequate as it is impossible to apply liberal understanding of equality to issues of sex and gender since sexes are socially defined by their mutual unlikeness.

Second, MacKinnon argues that gender difference is more rather gender dominance - the social meanings of "man" and "woman" remain linked to a hierarchical conception of heterosexuality: certain degrees of force/dominance are built from our understanding of normal heterosexual behaviour.

The acceptance of the natural causes us to accept other differences between sex. Because the average woman is not situated to men, formal equality can be detrimental. Therefore, if they were treated by the law in this gender-neutral way, it hides the unequal status.

Liberalism assumes individual agents who participate in the field of social interaction, makers of meaning - but this is blind to its own bias. Pornography hurts women, perpetuates the image of women as sexual objects and is in line with an unconscious sexual response, habituating its users to experience a sexual thrill from the degradation of others.

### Beyond Inequality: MacKinnon's Liberal Humanism

It is not false consciousness: "As liberal theory has looked for truth of women in the mirror of nature, left theory has looked for the truth of women in the mirror of social materiality" (1989, 122). "The complexity of this reality allows MacKinnon to avoid invoking the concept of false consciousness ... Both are exhibiting a real response to real conditions ... Yet neither is exhibiting a fully real response because ultimately both are products of oppressive conditions." (703)

Feminism provides an ability for women to understand their possibilities - women are what they are, but they can be something else. Feminism exists at the intersection of reality of women's oppression and their reality as complete human beings and affirms the reality of both.

However that oppression is not exhaustive of women's reality - radical feminism would be a celebration of victimhood.

Cornell opposes MacKinnon's realism to the poststructuralist view that social reality is indeterminate:
	"Clearly,  MacKinnon sees the social/sexual objectification of women as fairly stable rather than as a perpetually shifting text ... She disputes the social meaning of womanhood not on the grounds that identity is inherently indeterminate but because there is something to "woman" that is authentic and real, and it must be taken into consideration in assessing whether our social order is just." (704)

MacKinnon invokes a liberal humanist vision when she says: "Are women human beings or not?" - an overriding concern with women's capacity for choice and self-determination ... "women must participate in building this world as "real" (free) women, not as walking projections of male need ... The conflict over pornography exists between individuals and not between the individual and the state." (704)

### Connecting Epistemology and Politics

Paradoxically, MacKinnon wants liberals to see differently and to see more of what already tends to register as contrary to liberal principles ... [talking about Mill's harm principles] Liberalism is open to seeing harm in new places; the question is whether it is open to seeing harm in new ways. MacKinnon has been quite successful in arguing that sexual harassment constitutes harm, which suggests that mainstream American culture is willing to rethink its received notions of acceptable sexual behavior without abandoning its dominant liberal framework.
```

MacKinnon does not contextualise or historicize the ideals to which she appeals to in defending the importance of women's reality - [[Ring]] argues that MacKinnon emphasizes relativism and subjectivism over objectivity and defends a version of dialectical materialism as superior to her approach, that an intersection occurs between an interaction between subjectivities that provide objective reality.

```ad-quote

I have shown that MacKinnon orients herself not only toward a material inequality (that must be taken into account in order to correct liberalism's idealism) but also toward an abstract vantage point that cannot simply grow out of women's experience of inequality, and to which she attaches fairly traditional liberal ideals.
```

```ad-quote
title: 706
"There came a point in Black people's movement for equality in this country when slavery stopped being a question of how it could be justified and became a question of how it could be ended" (MacKinnon 1991a, 90). Just as arguments about racial equality shifted from explicit discrimination to systemic or endemic racism, so does radical feminism turn our attention to how sexism can be embedded in the social fabric in ways that may not come to light without sensitizing liberalism to its own blind spots.15 According to MacKinnon, liberalism's most dangerous blind spot in the application of its principles to women is the persistent presumption that they are meant to be sexually used, which undermines any individual woman's chances at a fair trial, an equal opportunity, and so on. Her arguments are designed to get us to recognize this presumption as a barrier, but nowhere does she herself advance an argument that barriers as such are wrong.

Instead, I submit, MacKinnon relies on liberal oppposition to barriers to individual choice and self-determination. Taking as a given that harm to another justifies limitation to one's freedom, she argues only that harm to women in the form of sexual objectification is such an instance. This requires more of a change in how we see women than in how we conceptualize the harm principle.
```

## Conclusion

```ad-quote
We see that MacKinnon agrees with liberals that choice, consent, and protecting individuals from harm by others from state power should "count" fundamentally. She also argues that women must "count" in how the abstract ideals are given life in a concrete social system. She demands that liberals consider soberly the question of whether women are indeed human beings, she spells out the serious implications of the seeming innocuous equivocation, "Yes, but..." This is not to reduce her theory to a demand for inclusion. But we cannot understand her work in complete opposition to liberal theory, and we cannot understand the way which liberalism may or may not be "feminist," or make sense for women, until we understand the complexity of her work and appreciate the depth of her challenge to liberalism.

It is a reformulation of liberal thinking.

# "The Case" Responds:

"I criticise the liberal tradition for its methodological idealism, meaning the extent to which it interprets material reality as driven by ideas and morality to the neglect of the reverse; for its individualism, meaning its failures to grasp systematically the group-based determinants of inequality; and for its relative blindness to organized power in diverse social forms, so that it often effectively sides with dominance. These tendencies are traced from epistemology to policy on the substantive ground of the status and treatment of women relative to men." (709)

"Calling inequality freedom promotes inequality. To say that my "overriding concern [is] with women's capacity for choice and self-determination" (704) is to proceed as if the terms mean what they pretend to mean, relabelling in liberal terms the systemic sex inequality that I criticize in both liberalism and the legal and social order to which it is integral - a reality that liberalism itself has gone too far to rationalize, cover up and legitimate as consensual and chosen." (709)

"My point has been that the social conditions under which women work could have what liberalism claims we have now, under which its ideas might work and its terms might mean what they are supposed to mean, would be conditions of sex equality, a goal that liberalism also claims to embrace but has done as much as any philosophy to preclude, while purporting the contrary." (709)

Empowering women does not mean to treat them as liberalism's individuals - sexual harassment and pornography are sex discrimination claims.

No conception of the human animates her work - "Rather, I argue that by existing social standards and in comparison with men - both, by the way, grounded and culturally specific standards - women in their status as members of the group women, are violated and unequal." (710)

Liberals can't interpret the world in other than liberal terms. To say that she does not contextualise or historicize the ideals is therefore twice wrong.
