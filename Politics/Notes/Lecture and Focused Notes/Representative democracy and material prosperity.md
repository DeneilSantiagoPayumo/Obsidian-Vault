High living standards and representative democracy

Acemoglu and Robinson - Inequalities can be explained principally through economic and political institutions, not geography or culture

Extractive institutions vs Inclusive institutions; proposed as a binary

Extractive - A small elite controls the resources of a state or prevents the development of a centralised state

Inclusive - Constitutional rules, democracy and the institutional spread of power

Creative destruction allows for economic change/development; only tends to be possible in inclusive economies

‘The countries that did not take advantage of new technologies did not benefit from the other engines of prosperity…This failure was due to their extractive institutions, either a consequence of the persistence of their absolutist regimes or because they lacked centralised states’

Extractive political + inclusive economic may equal short-term prosperity

Comparison 1:

North vs South Korea:

- Shared cultural history until very recently

- Minimal geographic differences

- North Korea heavily agrarian society; 8 x the infant mortality rate

Comparison 2:

United States vs Mexico; Nagales

- United States’ high living standards due to its continued reliance on democracy; Mexico’s relationship with it far more complicated

Comparison 3:

Europe vs China

- Everything changes in the 16 th century

- China by far the most advanced, until it banned foreign trade and shipbuilding at the same time as the European Age of Exploration

- 1661: Removal of the population of Southern China

Comparison 4:

England vs Spain

- Henry VII creates a centralised English state, around the same time that Castile and Aragon united

- Spanish crown enriched by colonial riches; England is as well, but the benefits are spread more widely amongst merchants

- 1688-89 - English Parliament deposes James II, limits monarchical power and encourages economic pluralism

- 1520 s - Spanish Parliament begins a failed revolt

- England industrialises; Spain goes into an extensive period of economic decline

- Links to America as all the benefits of English prosperity translate there; opposite is the case for South America

Comparison 5:

Africa vs the world

- 16 th century; Saharan slave trade most significant

- 18 th century; Atlantic slave trade around 10 x more significant

Dispute - was the 16 th century truly a success for Europe?

- Rise of the Ottomans; so must be refined to Western Europe

- In 1775, the Mughal Empire was the largest manufacturing empire in the world

- China had a far larger share of world GDP in the 18 th century

- 16 th century silver trade was the first truly world economy, and China was the centre of it all

1689 Declaration of Right: ‘All and singular the rights and liberties asserted and claimed in the said declaration, are the true, ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom’

Suggests reclamation rather than a novel revolution

100 years from the Glorious Revolution to the industrial revolution; why the long wait?

Geographical abundance of coal?

Then a maritime extractive empire?

China has recently combined authoritarian political institutions and rapid economic growth driven initially by maritime trade

## Lecture notes:

## What extractive institutions can and cannot do for [[Acemogulu and Robinson]]

1. They **can** increase prosperity for some time as long as there is a centralised state that can allocate resources
2. But this increase in prosperity **only goes to an elite**
3. Over time they prohibit technological change because they **cannot** foster *creative destruction*, including against the economic elite.


```ad-example
title: extractive institution succeeding and then failing: the Soviet Union
The Tsarist Russian state and the Soviet state both were centralised states with extractive institutions.
Stalin used the centralised Soviet state to drive industrialsied
The Soviet Union enjoyed temporary technological success against the US after 1945.
But in the 1970s the Soviet disadvantages and American advantages started to tell: the Soviet economy could not technologically innovate.
Once growth ended collapse occurred: first of Soviet rule in eastern Europe and then the Soviet Union.
```

```ad-example
title: China V Soviet comparison
- For Acemoglu and Robinson, China is a repeat of the Soviet story
- The caveat in the comparison: China has done better during the development phase because of the switch to **inclusive economic institutions** made by Deng Xiapoing in the late 1970s.
```

```ad-example
title: China-Soviet comparison
Communist China 1949-1976: Mao failed at industrialising China.
Post Mao: China's turn to inclusive economic institutions and external economic openness has produced rapid growth a big emphasis on technological modernity.
```

[[Acemogulu and Robinson]]: China needs to transition to inclusive political institutions like South Korea. But making everything about institution over-simplifies: Russia. But making everything about institution over-simplifies: Singapore.

```ad-quote
title: Lee Yuan Yew (founder of Singapore) saw institutions only in terms of the quality of decision-making ... and stressed culture over institutional rules.
“They say, oh, let’s have multiparty politics. Let’s have different parties change and be in charge of the Government. Is it that simple? You vote in a division Three government, not a Division One government, and the whole economy will just subside within three, four years. Finished.”

‘’Asian societies are unlike Western ones. The fundamental difference between Western concepts of society and government and East Asian concepts – when I say East Asians, I mean Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam, as distinct from Southeast Asia, which is a mix between the Sinic and the Indian, though Indian culture also emphasizes similar values – is that Eastern societies believe that the individual exists in the context of the family."
```

But can Singapore be compared with what is possible for China?

```ad-quote
title: The argument for the importance of China's historical culture to its present economic development
Zhang Weiwei, The China wave: rise of a civilisational state:

China now allies a technocratic commitment to intense economic modernity China with long-term historical dynamism from its history as a civilisational state (3rd century BCE)

‘Europe does not have the kind of dynamism shown abundantly in all Chinese cities, and many European cities such as Marseille, Rome and Naples are visibly behind China’s first-tier cities.’ 

‘In the case of China, political ideas and practices over the past millennia are the most important source of the Chinese perception of legitimacy. The Chinese concept of legitimacy had taken shape well before modern Western states came into being.’

```

This invites a China Taiwan comparison.

```ad-quote
title: Comparison China V Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century
1. Imperial China entered its final crisis and was economically dismembered by the European powers, the United States,
and Japan.

2. There is an institutional difference: imperial monarchy versus republics (US, France) and parliamentary monarchies (Britain, Germany, Japan) and Japan which is the one Asian power participating in the domination of China adopted western institutions (Meiji Constitution
1890).

3. But Russia (absolute monarchy) was also an imperial power.
```

Crucially, watershed for China was the First Opium War (1839-42) when East India Company steam naval power opened up China's post.
Leaves the question of whether there is a political explanation for Britain’s industrialisation and how much it really is early Industrialisation that is the crucial juncture in rising living standards.

# Conclusions : the limits of knowledge on this question
- Historically, we only know that the economies of the states categorised as having inclusive economic and political institutions have not yet stagnated over a long period of time.
- No decisive argument that the reason they have not stagnated is because inclusive institutions have been in place and now face an energy transition when energy cannot be separated from their past success.
- China case is difficult to judge: still mid-income with slowing growth, but it is extremely competitive in some technological innovation.
- Raises question about the importance of state power to technological innovation.
- Politics matters in explaining economic outcomes (Korea comparisons).
- But it is not sufficient, and it may not matter on the political side as Acemoglu and Robinson suppose (Singapore)
