## The Modern State: monarchies, republics

[[Thomas Hobbes]] knew a lot about ancient Greek democracy, and believed that democracy was a perfectly valid form of sovereignty but that there were strong reasons to prefer monarchy.

Then, the Founders in the US created a republic, something they understood to be different from a democracy. [[Benjamin Constant]] gave a lecture on liberty when France returned to monarchical government. Constant doesn't seem to be incredibly democratic.

We examined what is on the other side of the federalist topic: Tocqueville takes us to the years after Constant dies, and we examine the American constitution of people who state themselves as creating a republic, not a democracy.

WE want institutions that will give some expression to public opinion through frequent elections on the house of representatives, any number of constitutional features that will resist the democratic impulse: the senate was selected by the government of the different states. There is a powerful supreme court that could help in this regards. A powerful executive presidency. Then as now, the president would be elected by the electoral college: a fundamental undemocratic system.

Those institutions that these American founders have applied attracted the label of democracy. This is what we call the constitutional regime in America: Tocqueville certainly helped in this regard. Tocqueville is not chiefly interested in the constitutional practices, but was interested in the social character of America.

Over time, the language of democracy is increasingly used to characterize the American regime.

By the time of the 1848 revolution, the great year of European revolution, those revolutions flourished in 1848 and was shut down by the forces of reaction. God, I want to go to sleep.

Nevertheless, there is a process of ongoing democratization that underlies everything. After a civil war, the anarchic regime severely restricted the franchise. In 1832, this begins the process of broadening such a franchise. Still, there is a minority of Englishmen who had the votes.

In 1867 format, characterized as tory politics, there is now universal franchise, a mass electoral college. We have huge parties, nation-wide organizations.

That's an outline of the democratizing process in England. We can also tell stories in France.

## Two concepts of 19th-century democracy?

The committee observer observed two types of democracy: instead of having a strong and broad executive, but perhaps a Napoleonic model of charismatic authoritarian leaders.

From the perspective of the 19th century, the implication of what democracy might appear like in the future is massively different. National ideas become the vehicle for democratization. There are multi national states but they don't get to be very democratic. Democracy flourishes in homogenous communities not broader multinational regimes.

After the first world war, this is the moment that the national democratic state becomes a normal unit in European politics: most of the states in Europe aren't naturally governing the countries anymore and the national republic, the national representative democracy became a unit to do economics and shit, I don't fucking know. There's something normal about parliamentary democracy. If I'm sending these notes to someone, I apologize in advance.

National states become the vehicle for democratic politics.

What about the rise of socialism? How industrialisation is transforming society. Socialism is not becoming an individual regime, but a democratic one: Marx here constructed the communist manifesto. It speaks to a world of increasing urbanisation.

Look at that face. So punch-able. You can almost taste the smugness. What a snake.
There are so many forces in Austria. Too many.
## *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*

Marxists are right to think that socialism will replace Capitalism, the question is how. Capitalism is a system of creative destruction - entrepreneurs look for innovation, introduce new technologies, workers lose their jobs and people, they will vote for social democrats who promise social security.

As education level rises, we need more schools and universities, more intellectuals. Intellectuals whose jobs owe their creation to the success of the capitalist economy but aren't making a living from the economy becomes disaffected, spreading anti-capitalist ideas among the students.

This argument parallels Hayek. The Road to Serfdom: the democratic political engine is the transformation for road for socialism. Essentially, Socialism is more inefficient than Capitalism: less dynamism, less creative destruction, more heavily administered societies. 

Schumpeter argues that socialists have an instrumentalist attitude: they use democracy only when it suits them. But this isn't just socialism, this is for every political ideology.

He also argues, do we really align with processes as long as they're democratic? Democracy is only as good as the results that it produces.
