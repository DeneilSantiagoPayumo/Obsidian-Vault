title: pp. 3-4 on Marxism and Feminism
“Sexuality is to feminism what work is to marxism: that which is most one's own, yet most taken away…”

[For Marxism, work] “is that activity by which people become who they are. Class is its structure, production its consequence, capital a congealed form, and control its issue.

“Implicit in feminist theory is a parallel argument: the molding, direction, and expression of sexuality organizes society into two sexes: women and men… Sexuality is the social process through which social relations of gender are created, organized, expressed, and directed, creating the social beings we know as women and men…

“As the organized expropriation of the work of some for the benefit of others defines a class, workers, the organized expropriation of the sexuality of some for the use of others defines the sex, woman. Heterosexuality is its social structure, desire its internal dynamic, gender and family its congealed forms, sex roles its qualities generalized to social persona, reproduction a consequence, and control its issue.” (pp. 3-4)

title: pp. 160, on the modern state
“Liberalism applied to women has supported state intervention on behalf of women as abstract persons with abstract rights, without scrutinizing the content and limitations of these notions in terms of gender.

“Marxism applied to women is always on the edge of counseling abdication of the state as an arena altogether-and with it those women whom the state does not ignore or who are in no position to ignore it.

“As a result, feminism has been left with these tacit alternatives: either the state is a primary tool of women's betterment and status transformation, without analysis (hence strategy) of it as male; or women are left to civil society, which for women has more closely resembled a state of nature: The state, and with it the law, have been either omnipotent or impotent: everything or nothing…” (p. 160)

title: MacKinnon on negative liberty 164-5
“Philosophically, this posture is expressed in the repeated constitutional invocation of the superiority of "negative freedom"—staying out, letting be—over positive legal affirmations. Negative liberty gives one the right to be "left to do or be what [he} is able to do or be, without interference from other persons." The state that pursues this value promotes freedom when it does not intervene in the social status quo…

“For women, this has meant that civil society, the domain in which women are distinctively subordinated and deprived of power, has been placed beyond reach of legal guarantees. Women are oppressed socially, prior to law, without express state acts, often in intimate contexts. The negative state cannot address their situation in any but an equal society--the one in which it is needed least.” (pp. 164-5)

Contemporaries include Kimberle [[Crenshaw]] on intersectionality, [[Carole Pateman]] on The Sexual Contract.

title: On Prostitution (10-11)


But I mean, how is it that one can come to the judgment (she presents her work as normative) that what is presented as a free choice is not really, yet saying that to or about a person—“judgment that is directed to women” (Chambers 2017, 4, italics in original)—that they are inaccurate in thinking themselves free in making certain choices, for example—poses a wholly separate problem? Apparently, the issue she is isolating distinguishes between what one may say critically about a social situation and that same critique to the people in the situation or even about them as people in that situation, despite the fact that the purported choice situation is only ever constituted by these very people. Why is this distinct? Because they don’t take it well? Or because the situation is abstract and the individual is real? Or because the critic maybe “criticized” for “criticizing” them? What is driving the Chambers analysis, its standard for itself, what successfully answering her question would be, by what measure, is not specified, so it is hard to know. “Feminism,” frequently evoked, may be the answer, but what is that here? Feminism is not about how an individual is to live virtuously or be liked or be or feel above criticism. For something to be feminist is not an accolade or a gold star or a secret handshake or an invulnerable soapbox. It is about (do we really need to keep saying this?) ending male dominance and the subordination of women, including the status hierarchy of masculinity over femininity. This calls for real analytic and strategic assessments, which arise occasionally in her piece, but are not its central thrust or concern. 

To put this discussion into one reality context in which “choice” is constantly being invoked, perhaps the distinction being made is between criticism of choosing alternate conditions—say prostitution versus starvation—and criticism of the person said to be choosing between alternate conditions—say women prostituting to avoid starvation. Those of us who work against prostitution neither see this as a choice nor “judge” people being prostituted. At their request, we work together to hold their exploiters accountable and to build real alternatives—that is, to move society to provide what they are asking for, toward equality. People in prostitution who do not want to work with us in this way do not (or not until they have been used a few more years . . .). The examples she cites that consider women criticizing other women’s parenting styles as just as dangerous as the sexualization of children, or women judging other women as a plague worse than Donald Trump, have lost any sense of reality. When and how does one learn anything? Significantly, neither the consequences of the sexualization of children nor Donald Trump can be avoided by simply being ignored.

Unlike these examples, the “choice” question in the prostitution application, which is actually driving a policy discussion with real consequences worldwide, originates with people outside prostitution, usually liberal elites, who attack those of us working for abolition of prostitution for moralizing (we are not), so they can defend serial rape (most of it for the profit of others) as independent entrepreneurship. Is there a special problem with “judging” these defenders of what they call “her choice” for their elitism and denial of reality, for siding with vicious abuse, and for maintaining their own privileged status above prostituted women, in part by defending their subordination, which defense is typically lavishly rewarded by power? Does the fact some of them are women exempt them from this critique?Chambers does ask this question. But observed in its actual factual setting, the broader question of “judgment” as she frames it does not arise in this instance, because the victims are not being “judged.” Only the shills are. And the perpetrators they are standing in for.

We are against rape and pornography and sexual harassment and gendered poverty,” she argues, “because women should not be unequal to men . . . because it is badto treat them that way” (6). Actually, these are practices of sex inequality not because they are “bad” or because it would be “good” to treat women as if we are men’s human equals, but because we are, treated in the practices mentioned as if we are not. If sex inequality is a system of domination and subordination, a social hierarchy of power in the world, sex equality is not first a moral value and seeking it is not fundamentally a normative project in the conventional philosophical sense. Because men are not (that is the existential verb) women’s biological superiors, women men’s biological inferiors, sex equality is first a fact, denied realization in social orderings. It is the social inequality of the sexes that is normative without grounding, without ever having had to provide a philosophically sound account of itself, almost universally presented as merely reflecting a factual natural “difference,” when the differences between the sexes, such as they are, are equal, i.e., equally different, and as such contain no justification for domination or subordination, a thoroughly normative arrangement. The politics of sex equality are thus first rooted in a recognition of reality—the reality of the sexes’ human equality—not fundamentally based on a moral judgment that it would be good to treat the sexes as if they were equally human. We do not have to argue this proposition anymore. Once a sex equality rule exists in law, there is no more debate as to whether it would be “good” to treat the sexes equally. That has been decided. The only question is what sex equality means in particular instances. In other words, you do not need a normative position to have this critique. You need a reality position to answer the first question and a legal position to answer the third.

title: From we are unequal, to prostitution of children (14) then 15
Whether victims who do not report their victimization endanger other possible victims raises serious issues. Given the way survivors are treated by existing institutions, no one other than survivors themselves is in a position to “judge” them negatively for not reporting, in my opinion. But you can’t get to either of those conclusions without knowing (i.e., coming to a conclusion about, not a judgment of) who has the power and who doesn’t, who is violated and who isn’t, and how institutional systems treat survivors and accuseds. The analysis has to be done first concretely—reality is the question, what actually happened, not what or who you think is good or bad—even in philosophy.

Consider now sexual abuse of children more broadly, arguably the foundation of the gender system. The moral question, virtually never asked, is how do we know it is “bad.” The reality question is, how do we know it violates the child? Especially with girl children, how can it be a violation or experienced as such when females are told that being sexually used is an actualization of our existence on this earth? Amazingly, it is frequently experienced as abusive by children even when they have no vocabulary for abuse, have experienced abuse as normal in their lives, and are told it makes them loved and special and valuable. What they often say, then or later, is it just felt wrong. Maybe they mean wrong in Chambers’s moral sense. But more importantly, on the prior level of what is, something was created in them at the very moment something was shattered in them, which is amazing. There was a glimmer of awareness of abusiveness—a miracle, because one is created by abuse. It shapes you neurologically. It shapes you cognitively. It shapes your relationships and life agendas in ways you often have no notion of for decades,if ever. It is a powerful engine of social construction. But there are no lengthy philosophical discourses struggling to explain how “we,” including survivors, know sexual abuse of children is abusive.

Victims of abuse who do not feel violated, including those who in liberal terms make choices that harm them (or others), while not a target of such a “criticism,” do raise the question of how consciousness change happens—the question of effectiveness, and of who the “you” is doing the engagement, your relation with the survivor, underlining the necessary humility in any serious political work on a human level, and of appropriate role, relationship, and setting. There is no philosophical perch from which to dispense judgment here, if social change is your goal. It does not happen through writing papers or speaking in public. Reaching out to survivors, being there when they reach out to you, and learning from them is not done by “judgment,” which, accurate or not, is an imposition and forecloses productive interaction, real learning on both sides. Obviously, people who do not feel violated will not be complaining to prosecutors, or maybe even to you. But their existence does not preclude coming to the conclusion that those who know they are hurt by the same behavior are hurt by it, with perpetrators who need to be called out in general if not always in particular. There are plenty of such survivors looking for a response other than the echo chamber of their own silence. Which leads me to want to know what in life leads to the need to answer the question Clare Chambers poses. What makes it urgent? My own view is that the term “choice,” the circumstances in which one can most clearly know it, best applies to decisions againstone’s determinants, to resistance to social construction. For this, you have to know how you are being socially constructed, what your determinants are. Although no general rules will likely emerge, whatever concretely gave rise to Professor Chambers’squestion, or at least engagement with more real situations in which serious consequences are at stake, is likely to hold the keys to an answer.

What is driving the Chambers analysis, its standard for itself, what successfully answering her question would be, by what measure, is not specified, so it is hard to know. “Feminism,” frequently evoked, may be the answer, but what is that here? Feminism is not about how an individual is to live virtuously or be liked or be or feel above criticism. For something to be feminist is not an accolade or a gold star or a secret handshake or an invulnerable soapbox. It is about (do we really need to keep saying this?) ending male dominance and the subordination of women, including the status hierarchy of masculinity over femininity. This calls for real analytic and strategic assessments, which arise occasionally in her piece, but are not its central thrust or concern. (11)

But observed in its actual factual setting, the broader question of “judgment” as she frames it does not arise in this instance, because the victims are not being “judged.” Only the shills are. And the perpetrators they are standing in for. Who is being “judged” for what relation to inequality has to be specified to be clear on her judgment question. The term “judgment” carries triple political/moral/legal meanings that seem to me conflated in the Chambers piece. It can mean a conclusion about a reality of people or happenings based on evidence and analysis, the attachment of negative value to someone or something, or a legal decision (literally, a judgment) under pre-existing standards as to what institutional assessment will be made of what occurred by whom, usually including who is being held responsible for it. My epistemic project works on the first of these levels, its law and politics seamlessly on the third. (12)
