Lecture: Ben. Constant
Date: 19-10-23
Lecturer: Helen Thompson

---

For Constant, the Leviathan was the problem of modern politics, not the remedy.

```ad-quote
title: Why? (The Spirit of conquest and usurpation and their relation to European civilisation)
"The mistakes of men in authority, of whatever degree, cannot be innocent as those of private individuals. Force always waits behindd these errors, ready to lend them its terrible consequences."
```


## The French Revolution

He was born in 1767 amidst the French Revolution.
1789 - debt crisis, where the French monarchy called the French parliament (the Estates General) and they form a National Assembly.

The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen:

```ad-seealso
title: The declaration:
"The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and impresciptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation; Law is the expression of the general will."
```

Here's a question. Why am I slave even though I have natural rights?
The French revolution starts with the slave rebellion in 1791 in Saint-Domingue.
Then, there's the rise of Napoleon - in 1795, the Directory took power (weak executive and a legislature). In 1802, Napoleon invaded Haiti and reintroduced slavery.

## A bit more about Constant
Constant (1767-1830) was born in Switzerland but spent a vast majority of his time in France.
He supported the republic, backed Napoleon, broke with him, became an adviser in 1815, and returned to France in 1817.

Constant's critiques:
1. The old French monarchy
2. The terror of the Jacobins
3. The idea of the nation
4. Napoleon as a conquering emperor
5. The application of ancient political ideas in the modern world.


### The French Monarchy

The revolution had happened because the monarchy had used the power of the state in such an arbitrary way.

```ad-quote
title: Constant about the French monarchy
The last French Kings had led "vicious governments ... repressive in their effects, absurd in their principles, wretched in action: governments which had as their strength arbitrary power; for their purpose the belittling of mankind."
```

There's nothing, for instance, in Hobbes' writings that limit the power of the monarch.

### Terror of the Jacobins

The revolutionaries had inherited a state and in doing so commanded massive coercive power.
They could not be trusted intrinsically with power any more than the monarchs of the past.
They wanted to restore an ancient idea of virtue without regard for the actual beliefs of French citizens.

In terms of the Leviathan, all that changed was the hands of who had the power. Really, nothing changed and people still practice tyranny. Without anything to check the power of the state,

When you say we want new French citizens, we want them to think different, we only must tyrannize them to get rid of their old beliefs - getting rid of their compliance.

### Constant's critique of the nation
```ad-quote
"We are always hearing about the great empire, of the whole nation, abstract notions that have no reality. The great empire is nothing independently of its provinces. The whole nation is nothing separated from the parts that compose it. it is in defending the rights of these parts that one defends the rights of the whole nation; since the nation itself is divided into each of these parts."

```

What the Jacobins did was to introduce (what we would think of) conscription: a fundamental obligation of citizenship was that you had to fight in these revolutionary wars. The nation became the rallying call.

France dominates most of the continent of Europe. Only Russia and Britain that France. This was a clear example of things that were wrong but in international terms, seemed massively successful: citizen armies had a great advantage in fighting things and wars.

Constant rejects the notion that there is such a thing as the nation. Actually, the nation is where sovereignty lies, not the state. Not in the quote, he enters a contradiction: 'defends the whole right of the nation' but says there is no nation.

```ad-quote
title: Critique of the nation:
If they [the parts of the nation] are successively stripped of what they hold dearest, if each of them, isolated as to be made a victim, reverts, by strange metamorphosis, to being a portion of the great whole, to serve as the pretext for the sacrifice of another portion, the real beings are sacrificed to the abstract one. The people as individuals are sacrificed for the sake of the people en masse.
```

### Constant's critique of Napoleon
```ad-quote
title: Constant about Napoleon (The spirit of conquest and their relation to European civilisation, ch. 15):
"I have sometimes wondered what one of these men who wish to repeat the deeds of ... Alexander ... would reply if his people spoke to him and told him: nature has given you ... boundless energy, a consuming need for strong emotion, an inexhaustible thirst for confronting and surmounting danger ... but why should we pay for these? Are we here only to build, with our dying bodies, your road to fame? You are bored by the inactivity of peace. Why should your boredom concern us? ... Learn civilisation if you wish to reign in a civilised age. Learn peace, if you wish to rule over peaceful people."
```

Napoleon is man born out of time. He simply did not belong in the modern terms.
So here's the fundamental argument.

```ad-important
title: The problem of ancient politics in the modern world: modern world is fundamentally different
* In the modern world, there are large states, not the city states where monarchy was absent.
* Athenian democracy and the Roman republic depended on slavery
* In the modern world, commerce is replacing war
* Liberty now meant something different: ancient liberty was tied to participation in politics.
* Modern liberty meant the freedom to live according to one's own private tastes, beliefs, especially religious, and pleasures.
```

You just can't take something that's only important in a city state and extrapolate that into the world of the international politics.
For all that you glorify the ancients, that they're either completely taking a blind eye to slavery or they're completely indifferent to it in the case of Napoleon.
You have war, and the alternative is commerce and peace.

We just can't yank ideas from the ancient world and place that herein, like Jacobins who are obsessed with the idea of ancient liberty, wanting them to fight wars as citizens, wanted to be virtuous, wanted to think of politics all the time. But really, these individuals want the freedom to choose how to live in their private life.

The very foundation of modern politics is this possession of modern liberty.

```ad-quote
title: Constant about happiness
"The progress of civilisation, the commercial tendency of the age, the communication among the peoples, have infinitely multiplied and varied the means of individual happiness. To be happy, men need only to be left in perfect independence in all that concerns their occupations, their undertakings, their sphere of activity, their fantasies."
