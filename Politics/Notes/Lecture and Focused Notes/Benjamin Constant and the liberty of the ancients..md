Lecture: Ben. Constant
Date: 19-10-23
Lecturer: Helen Thompson, [[Benjamin Consant]]

For Constant, the Leviathan was the problem of modern politics, not the remedy.

```ad-quote
title: Why? (The Spirit of conquest and usurpation and their relation to European civilisation)
"The mistakes of men in authority, of whatever degree, cannot be innocent as those of private individuals. Force always waits behindd these errors, ready to lend them its terrible consequences."
```


## The French Revolution

He was born in 1767 amidst the French Revolution.
1789 - debt crisis, where the French monarchy called the French parliament (the Estates General) and they form a National Assembly.

The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen:

```ad-seealso
title: The declaration:
"The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and impresciptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation; Law is the expression of the general will."
```

Here's a question. Why am I slave even though I have natural rights?
The French revolution starts with the slave rebellion in 1791 in Saint-Domingue.
Then, there's the rise of Napoleon - in 1795, the Directory took power (weak executive and a legislature). In 1802, Napoleon invaded Haiti and reintroduced slavery.

## A bit more about Constant
Constant (1767-1830) was born in Switzerland but spent a vast majority of his time in France.
He supported the republic, backed Napoleon, broke with him, became an adviser in 1815, and returned to France in 1817.

Constant's critiques:
1. The old French monarchy
2. The terror of the Jacobins
3. The idea of the nation
4. Napoleon as a conquering emperor
5. The application of ancient political ideas in the modern world.


### The French Monarchy

The revolution had happened because the monarchy had used the power of the state in such an arbitrary way.

```ad-quote
title: Constant about the French monarchy
The last French Kings had led "vicious governments ... repressive in their effects, absurd in their principles, wretched in action: governments which had as their strength arbitrary power; for their purpose the belittling of mankind."
```

There's nothing, for instance, in Hobbes' writings that limit the power of the monarch.

### Terror of the Jacobins

The revolutionaries had inherited a state and in doing so commanded massive coercive power.
They could not be trusted intrinsically with power any more than the monarchs of the past.
They wanted to restore an ancient idea of virtue without regard for the actual beliefs of French citizens.

In terms of the Leviathan, all that changed was the hands of who had the power. Really, nothing changed and people still practice tyranny. Without anything to check the power of the state,

When you say we want new French citizens, we want them to think different, we only must tyrannize them to get rid of their old beliefs - getting rid of their compliance.

### Constant's critique of the nation
```ad-quote
"We are always hearing about the great empire, of the whole nation, abstract notions that have no reality. The great empire is nothing independently of its provinces. The whole nation is nothing separated from the parts that compose it. it is in defending the rights of these parts that one defends the rights of the whole nation; since the nation itself is divided into each of these parts."

```

What the Jacobins did was to introduce (what we would think of) conscription: a fundamental obligation of citizenship was that you had to fight in these revolutionary wars. The nation became the rallying call.

France dominates most of the continent of Europe. Only Russia and Britain that France. This was a clear example of things that were wrong but in international terms, seemed massively successful: citizen armies had a great advantage in fighting things and wars.

Constant rejects the notion that there is such a thing as the nation. Actually, the nation is where sovereignty lies, not the state. Not in the quote, he enters a contradiction: 'defends the whole right of the nation' but says there is no nation.

```ad-quote
title: Critique of the nation:
If they [the parts of the nation] are successively stripped of what they hold dearest, if each of them, isolated as to be made a victim, reverts, by strange metamorphosis, to being a portion of the great whole, to serve as the pretext for the sacrifice of another portion, the real beings are sacrificed to the abstract one. The people as individuals are sacrificed for the sake of the people en masse.
```

### Constant's critique of Napoleon
```ad-quote
title: Constant about Napoleon (The spirit of conquest and their relation to European civilisation, ch. 15):
"I have sometimes wondered what one of these men who wish to repeat the deeds of ... Alexander ... would reply if his people spoke to him and told him: nature has given you ... boundless energy, a consuming need for strong emotion, an inexhaustible thirst for confronting and surmounting danger ... but why should we pay for these? Are we here only to build, with our dying bodies, your road to fame? You are bored by the inactivity of peace. Why should your boredom concern us? ... Learn civilisation if you wish to reign in a civilised age. Learn peace, if you wish to rule over peaceful people."
```

Napoleon is man born out of time. He simply did not belong in the modern terms.
So here's the fundamental argument.

```ad-important
title: The problem of ancient politics in the modern world: modern world is fundamentally different
* In the modern world, there are large states, not the city states where monarchy was absent.
* Athenian democracy and the Roman republic depended on slavery
* In the modern world, commerce is replacing war
* Liberty now meant something different: ancient liberty was tied to participation in politics.
* Modern liberty meant the freedom to live according to one's own private tastes, beliefs, especially religious, and pleasures.
```

You just can't take something that's only important in a city state and extrapolate that into the world of the international politics.
For all that you glorify the ancients, that they're either completely taking a blind eye to slavery or they're completely indifferent to it in the case of Napoleon.
You have war, and the alternative is commerce and peace.

We just can't yank ideas from the ancient world and place that herein, like Jacobins who are obsessed with the idea of ancient liberty, wanting them to fight wars as citizens, wanted to be virtuous, wanted to think of politics all the time. But really, these individuals want the freedom to choose how to live in their private life.

The very foundation of modern politics is this possession of modern liberty.

```ad-quote
title: Constant about happiness
"The progress of civilisation, the commercial tendency of the age, the communication among the peoples, have infinitely multiplied and varied the means of individual happiness. To be happy, men need only to be left in perfect independence in all that concerns their occupations, their undertakings, their sphere of activity, their fantasies."

## Ancient liberty in the ancient world was not dangerous.

There was no Leviathan of the modern state of the modern state - the ancient Athenian assembly did not have the same kind of coercive apparatus behind it.

The ancients wanted ancient liberty: there was acceptance of 'the complete subjection of the individual to the authority of the community'

```ad-quote
title: About ancient liberty
The right to choose one's own religious affiliation ... was to the ancients a crime and a sacrilege.
```

There was not a strong sense of individuality, people living a separate existence from others. There was a complete subjection of the individual to the authority.

This particularly manifested itself in the idea that people choose their religious beliefs, and had a conscience of their religious belief - you can't find that in the ancient world. People were accepting of the religious world and its beliefs.

### You cannot impose ancient liberty on the moderns in France

For Constant, the mistake of the revolutionaries are that they ignored actual wants and beliefs.
Most French people did not want ancient liberty, nor can they exercise it - the radical revolutionaries asked that the people made sacrifices, including of their lives, to ends most didn't value.

It's not realistic because most people don't value modern liberty, and because we don't live in ancient states. People come in and demand others to sacrifice their lives ... for absolutely nothing. It was founded on a mistaken idea of the world that the revolution was lived in. It never could've turned out any differently.

It was not some accident. It was baked into the very ideas that a small group of people could impose the idea of what politics should be - of people who wanted to live their lives in a very different way.

## The moderns need representative government

Representation is 'a discovery of the moderns'..

```ad-quote
title: The idea of representation:
The representative system is nothing but an organisation by means of which a nation charges a few individuals to do what it cannot or does not wish to do herself.
```

The protection of modern liberty should be the purpose of representative government.

Moderns must through "exercise an active or constant surveillance over their representative" - can't enjoy modern liberty so much that they won't act politically to defend it.

### The moderns have introduced and are protected by commerce

Commerce in the ancient world was a 'lucky accident' but for the moderns it is 'the normal state of things'.

It is commerce that 'inspires in men a vivid love of individual independence'.

The arbitrary power of the modern state threatens commerce ... but commerce also protects modern liberty from the modern state.

Property under modern commerce circulates and is hard to seize.

Credit (debt): 'places authority itself in a position of dependence', straining war - if 'money hides itself or flees; all the operations of the state are suspended.'
(Not a Constant quote)

This makes it more difficult for states to do things that are 'bad' - if creditors think war is a bad thing, they stop buying the debt.

He gives a critique of a utopian politics -  he understands the impulse to try and recover what might have been lost from antiquity. In failing to understand the change between the ancient and modern world, 'otherwise well-intentioned men caused infinitive evils during our long and stormy revolution.'

'The fact is that social power injured individual independence in every possible way, without destroying the need for it.'

## The Soviet revolution as deadlier repetition of the French

Many of the Russian revolutionaries thought of themselves as imitating the French - Russian Revolution followed a similar path from representation to tyranny except it was deadlier - Russian Revolution followed a path from representation to tyranny except that it was far, far deadlier.

The Bolsheviks attempted to export revolution eastwards in Europe until defeated in Poland.

Under justification of war, the Bolsheviks organised a revolutionary police to eliminated 'class enemies' and 'counter-revolutionary saboteurs'.

Under Stalin up to 15 million died, including a state imposed famine in Ukraine.

### The Bolshevik revolution and new beliefs

The Bolsheviks began with the objective of eliminating religious beliefs from Russia and requiring Atheism.

The Soviet state had appropriated for the state all property of the Russian Orthodox Church and many Christians were killed.

After the Nazi invasion of the USSR, Stalin reversed course - seeing it as a source of Russian patriotism necessary to fight the war.

After Stalin's death, Khrushchev turned back to the state atheism policy.

Napoleon was an out of place accident - an ancient - in the modern world.

Napoleon used the language of liberation but reintroduced slavery in Haiti - in losing war against Haiti, Napoleon was defeated in his aim of acquiring a North American empire.

Sold territory it did not control to the US which was crucial to American expansion afterwards.

### Imposing ancient war on the moderns in Europe

For Constant, imperial war was now unnecessary and self defeating.

But 19th century was war and commerce, not war versus commerce.
The first Opium War opened China by British naval force to European commercial pwoers.
The Suez Canal changed transit of trade, leading to geopolitical conflict, leading to Britain's occupation of Egypt in 1882.

### France and empire

Constant and illusion of self-sufficiently in the emerging industrial age:

```ad-quote
title: Napoleon
"The commercial nation of modern Europe, industrious, civilised, placed on a territory large enough for their needs, linked to other peoples by relations the interruption of which would be a disaster, have nothing to hope from conquest."
```

Constant died six months after the French imperial conquest of Algeria.

### What is modern liberty in modern politics?

For Constant: "There is ... a part of human existence which by necessity remains individual and independent and which is outside any social competence. Sovereignty has only a limited and relative existence. At the point where independence and individual existence begin, the jurisdiction of sovereignty ends."

Modern individual liberty are in general and the specific liberties that follow for Constant are not natural rights - they were what moderns had come to value so much that they could not imagine life without them.

But what if modern liberty depends on extraction, leading to empire and war by leviathans?
