Thanks Jasper!

We are starting in the United States, to take some of the ideas presented there and draw broader points about the nature of democracy and the questions raised. However, we could, of course, start in Europe. The difference here is that there was mass discussion at the time in the US about representative democracy, and we can read those, and analyse them. The information available to us is simply invaluable.

## The creation of the American federal republic.

- 1776: Declaration of Independence by thirteen colonies.
- 1783: Military victory as a confederation of states.
- 1787-1788: Established constitution for a federal republic.

There is a distinction between the confederation – a loose association between the colonies, and a federation, which a more cohesive and encompassing agreement between them.

There are three stories through which we will discuss America:
1. Settlers from Britain with English constitutional claims – the colonies were, of course, British colonies. And the people that were forming the American constitution carried a strong belief that they were carrying on a constitutional tradition that had originated not just in Britain, but in England (pre-unification).
2. A divided confederation.
3. The spectre of Rome – we will see that the American federalists (by which we mean those that were in favour of the new constatation), had a sense that what they were doing was to recreate what Rome had, and to ensure that theirs did not end up like Rome’s.

## Settlers:

Why did the colonies, then, declare independence? For a long time, ‘No taxation without representation’ was held to be the fundamental reason as to why the thirteen colonies wanted independence from the British Crown. There is no doubt that that is part of what is going on. But it is important to make the point that the conflicts do, in fact, go deeper than that issue would suggest.

This is open to historical contest, but we cannot understand the question of why the American states were so keen on independence without understanding something about the territory of the US at the time. What the settlement of 1763, the Royal Proclamation on the issue of territory in America said was that American colonies could not expand any further West. And the Spanish are in control of the land West of the Mississippi. And there was a fair amount of resistance across the thirteen states about this idea.

The third issue that becomes very clear from 1774, the British government decides that there could be the free expression of Catholicism in British owned Quebec. The British state is giving Catholicism the go ahead, right next to a massively protestant settler community.

Of course, the role of slavery (in some states, such as Virginia) did play some part in anti-British sentiment, as they were willing to outlaw and stop the slave trade.

But clearly, there is a set of grievances against the British Crown here, that the American people don’t think can be addressed. When, however, they made their arguments as to why they should have independence – and you can see this in the federalist papers – they present themselves as the carries of English tradition and rights. They claim British, or English history, in the Magna Carter (1215), for instance. They see themselves as defenders of ‘ancient rights and liberties’, and they see themselves as defending the constitutional rights of parliament, which had been settler in 1689 against the Crown. They argued that it was, in fact, George III that had fucked it.

But, when we get to the Declaration of Independence, it does in fact, rest on the idea of godliness and holiness, and God-given rights.

## A divided confederation, post-independence.

The British Crown puts up resistance, of course, to the American Wars of Independence, and so the thirteen states need to form an army in order to fight this war.

They create the Articles of Confederation (approved 1777), which created a weak Continental Congress with no authority to tax and no power to compel states to provide revenue. It has the ability to spend money, but it is dependent on the thirteen states giving money that they raise to it. ‘Each states retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence’. This is a political association; this is a legislature that crucially lacks the ability to tax.

Moving on, if we go to 1787, this is the year in the summer of which the conference to decide on this constitutional convention takes place. The US was embroiled in a really significant debt crises – remember that the French Revolution had happened during a similarly large debt crisis. And there are two different things going on - the American Continental Congress could not pay interest on its debt. It was on the edge of bankruptcy. But inside the thirteen states, particularly Massachusetts, you had poor debtors, such as farmers, who were unable to pay interest on their debt. And they had started to mobilise in order to prevent debt law being enforced.

The most important was Shay’s Rebellion, which shut down Massachusetts civil courts – the continental congress could not pay any troops to put the rebellion down, because they too were broke as shit.

## North America in 1783: External Security and Westward expansion.

All of the land that was protected Native territories is gone, and their land stretches the whole way to the Mississippi river. But it is surrounded by expansionist states that desire it’s land. So, it’s got a security issue, mainly from Spain – who prevent American boats from navigating the Mississippi. And this produces endless disputes between the thirteen states about what to do about this.

- This is, in many ways, a crisis of political authority for the US confederation.
- ‘No money is paid into the public treasure; no respect is paid to the federal authority (…) It is not possible that a government can last long under the circumstances.’ (James Madison, The Framers’ Coup, p. 12).
- The issue, perhaps then, at this time, the issue with the American political association was the immediate lack of sovereign.

## Rome, and it’s shadow.

1. Federalists wanted a republic (Rome), and not a democracy (Athens). Because Rome is where the word republic comes from. There is a very strong distinction that Madison makes between the two. Madison had a number of issues with the Roman republic, but these issues that plagued Athens.
2. Generally, republics were short lived – they eventually become empires with monarchs (or emperors) like Rome or were conquered like Florence. It moves away from its republican roots, normally through its desire for expansion. But to just stay a republic, without expansion, they get conquered by monarchies. For Madison, the act of creating a federal republic was, in his mind, answering a profound historical question. Could there be a republic in a relatively large state, that lasted in time?
3.  Could the American republic survive as a republic in time? To be or not to be Rome.

## The American federal constitution.

1. Was drafted in Philadelphia in 1787 – We know that those in favour of the constitution prevailed. But it wasn’t like that ‘in the room’, it was a fierce struggle to get it fully ratified by each of the individual states. If nine out of the thirteen agreed, then those nine would come into being under it.
2. It was only ratified in 1788 for eleven states (North Carolina came in 1989; Rhode Island in 1790), after fierce political contest. Indeed, Alexander Hamilton, Madison and Jay tried to organise a set of newspaper articles, which were written under a pseudonym.

## How should we understand the Federalist Papers?

1. A set of reasoned arguments about republican government. They can be treated as a discussion about the nature of liberty, as made in good faith. But some of these arguments may be advanced intellectually, but they can be reasonably understood to as being used as a means to an end. The language used, then, is extremely important.

*Actually, modern demagogy, too, employs the spoken word. But it makes even more sustained use of the printed word.* (Weber).

‘*What a strange and unnecessary accumulation of words are here used to conceal from the public eye what might have been expressed in the follow concise manner’.* (Brutus, Letter 3).

These are not scholarly accounts. They are arguments.

## [[James Madison]].

He was from Virginia, and a slave owner. He was a very strong exponent of Westward expansion. He probably contributed more to the content of the Constitution than anyone else who was there in Philadelphia.

His arguments, generally, are as follows:

1. He said that factions are inescapable in politics because of human nature. ‘The latent causes of faction are (…) sown it he nature of man’. (Federalist, 10). There is no point trying to destroy factionalism, you must try to contain and reduce its impact. There are a great many causes of factions: religious beliefs, opinions about government, the unequal distribution of property.
2. He was against democracy. ‘Democracies have ever been spectacle of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property’. (Federalist, 10). He argued that even if all of Athens had been Socrates, it would have still been a mob. Even the cleverest of all of the Athenians could not have prevented its downfall. Individual conscience, and it being under threat in a democracy is bound up in a lot of late 18th century thought.
3. He wants representation, which for him, filters away the passions in politics, and leaves those that are most capable, in Madison’s mind, of making decision of virtue to make those decisions. It takes the heat out of politics. It means the pursuit of the common good, not a manifestation of individual desires. This ensures that America is, in many ways, miles away from Athenian democracy.
4. Power is necessary, and power corrupts: ‘If angels were to govern men, neither external no internal controls on government’ (51). ‘You must first enable the government to control the government, and in the next place oblige it to control itself’ (51).

## Design of the constitution:

He argued that we could solve the problem of what happens to a republic by making it large. Historically it has been the case that republics have started in cities, and monarchies have existed in large territories. Madison argued that republics should be huge, and that they should contain lots of factions. And they can, therefore, contain each other. This, he asserted, would make it harder for majorities to mobilise. All citizens cannot come together due to the fucking size of the place.

You too, need what he came to call federalism – the idea that dividing sovereignty, between the government at the centre and the fifty states – which would produce strength. The most important thing that the government at the centre needed to have been the power to tax. In the first instance, the states lost their ability to tax. That left an awkward question about what the relationship between the states and the constitution would be. There was no national referendum on it, and individual states were deciding whether or not they would choose to ratify.

But this was a way of separating power territorially, and it’s hard to point to any historical precedent of it. And this is part of the separation of powers. If you had the same people making the same decisions about everything, you would have a tyrannical sovereign. ‘Ambition must be made to counteract ambition’. The point for Madison is that the executive, the legislative, and the judicial prevent the tyranny of the others. There can only be action when all three branches agree.

This becomes a serious retort to Hobbes. The question that this raised is whether or not Hobbes was right – does this lead to civil war? In fact, perhaps, yes. You could argue that the civil war was a direct result of the way that the constitution was put forward.

But there is this idea that ultimate sovereignty came directly from the consent of the governed.
