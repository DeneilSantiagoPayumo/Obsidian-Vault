## Lecture notes:

### Leviathan I

>[!question] Questions we will consider
>Who has and should have the authority to decide?
>For what purpose should these with authority exercise power?
>When can existing authority holders be replaced?

And in total: How can human beings politically organise collective life?
	When do we get a right to rebel?


# A close look at several different 'states'
## New Kingdom of Egypt 16th to 11th century BCE
In this environment, the monarchy was tied to religious leadership.
The Pharoah was the 'Lord of the Two Lands' and 'High Priest of Every Temple'
They ruled as a king and represented every god on Earth.

In this civilisation, there is a close alignment between the exercise of political and spiritual authority - conceived as two different roles and activities (seen in the two different roles of the Pharaoh)

## Imperial Chinese State (created 221 BCE)
Monarchy.
Having the 'Mandate of Heaven' to rule, the Emperor as the 'Son of Heaven' had to rule ethically.
An immoral Emperor justified rebellion and a successful rebellion was interpreted as the mandate of the Heaven passing from one emperor to the next.
Therefore the passing of authority had an *ethical* notion.

## Athenian democracy 6th-4th century BCE
The association of citizens together were a 'poll'.
The citizens made decisions collectively in the assembly and administrative roles were chosen by lots.
The imaginative point of Athenian democracy was the glory of the city, including to rule other cities, and the realisation of its citizens talents.

It was *random.* Chosen by lottery. Every person (excluding women and slaves) were considered equal. If inquired into the nature of this government, 'it was for the glory of the city' and the ability for citizens to use their powers.

## [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]]
Hobbes argued that all these forms of government worked through a sovereign or they did not exist at all.
This was a subversive idea for those committed to the idea of the superiority of non-monarchical government.

In totality, this boiled down the nature to the government to a sovereign. In his mind, there was no distinction.

>[!info] In response to the previous question:
>Hobbes believed that the Sovereign should have unlimited power.
>They should only be replaced when the Sovereign no longer has power
>The authority should exercise their power to secure the state and the subjects.

There is a binary to this theory.

>[!quote] Hobbes believed that:   
>Without a Sovereign, 'there is a dominion of passions, war, fear, poverty, slovenliness, solitude, barbarism, ignorance, cruelty'
>With an all-powerful Sovereign, there is 'the dominion of reason, peace, security, riches, decency, society, elegancy, sciences and benevolence' (De Cive, chapter 10)

#### Why should we trust our life to unlimited power?
When examining the 20th century, why should we undergo Hobbes' theory?
The answer is simply: civil war is **always** worse than tyranny.

There is several advantages to taking Hobbes seriously:
Well,  Civil war is a catastrophe when it occurs (the Democratic Republic of the Congo civil war 1996-2003 cost more than 5 million lives.)
Secondly, we live in a world of competing moral beliefs, and this makes agreeing on the ends of government extremely difficult.
Modern states do at least in part work like Hobbes' Sovereign: the authority of the law backed by power.

He raises several questions:
**Is conflict between human beings an inescapable part of the human beings?**
**Can moral agreement substitute for political conflict?**
**Why is political life prone to instability?**

___Counter Arguments___

That said, it's not self-evident that civil-war is that destructive *and* the consequences of having a Sovereign as in Saddam Hussein.

#### It's important centrally to consider the context of Hobbes' starting place.
The English civil war between 1642-1651: two massive conflicts between Crown V Parliament and religious differences within Protestantism.
There was Instability: war broke out 1642, and Parliament executed the king, ruled with the army and in 1660 the monarchy returned.
Hobbes' sympathies were monarchist: exile in France but published Leviathan as a plea for the republic's authority to be accepted.

Therein, is Hobbes' main arguments:
1. Human beings have an exceptional capacity to disagree with one another, and there is no possible unified morality to remedy this problem.
2. A lot of language about political authority and power is nonsensical.
3. Human beings are capable of reason, but are more likely to act from their passion and pretend it is reason that is driving them.

>[!Quote] In regard to the problem of language in Politics, Hobbes speaks in Chapter 19 of the Leviathan
>For they that are discontented under Monarchy, call it Tyranny; and they that are displeased with Aristocracy, called it Oligarchy: So also, they which find themselves grieved under a Democracy, call it Anarchy, and yet I think no man believed, that want of Government, is any new kind of Government; nor by the same reason ought they to believe, that the Government is of one kind, when they like it, and another, when they mislike it, or are oppressed by the Governors. 

In a sense, he is both an optimist and a pessimist.
