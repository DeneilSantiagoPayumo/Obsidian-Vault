## Lecture notes:

### Leviathan I

>[!question] Questions we will consider
>Who has and should have the authority to decide?
>For what purpose should these with authority exercise power?
>When can existing authority holders be replaced?

And in total: How can human beings politically organise collective life?
	When do we get a right to rebel?


# A close look at several different 'states'
## New Kingdom of Egypt 16th to 11th century BCE
In this environment, the monarchy was tied to religious leadership.
The Pharoah was the 'Lord of the Two Lands' and 'High Priest of Every Temple'
They ruled as a king and represented every god on Earth.

In this civilisation, there is a close alignment between the exercise of political and spiritual authority - conceived as two different roles and activities (seen in the two different roles of the Pharaoh)

## Imperial Chinese State (created 221 BCE)
Monarchy.
Having the 'Mandate of Heaven' to rule, the Emperor as the 'Son of Heaven' had to rule ethically.
An immoral Emperor justified rebellion and a successful rebellion was interpreted as the mandate of the Heaven passing from one emperor to the next.
Therefore the passing of authority had an *ethical* notion.

## Athenian democracy 6th-4th century BCE
The association of citizens together were a 'poll'.
The citizens made decisions collectively in the assembly and administrative roles were chosen by lots.
The imaginative point of Athenian democracy was the glory of the city, including to rule other cities, and the realisation of its citizens talents.

It was *random.* Chosen by lottery. Every person (excluding women and slaves) were considered equal. If inquired into the nature of this government, 'it was for the glory of the city' and the ability for citizens to use their powers.

## [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]]
Hobbes argued that all these forms of government worked through a sovereign or they did not exist at all.
This was a subversive idea for those committed to the idea of the superiority of non-monarchical government.

In totality, this boiled down the nature to the government to a sovereign. In his mind, there was no distinction.

>[!info] In response to the previous question:
>Hobbes believed that the Sovereign should have unlimited power.
>They should only be replaced when the Sovereign no longer has power
>The authority should exercise their power to secure the state and the subjects.

There is a binary to this theory.

>[!quote] Hobbes believed that:   
>Without a Sovereign, 'there is a dominion of passions, war, fear, poverty, slovenliness, solitude, barbarism, ignorance, cruelty'
>With an all-powerful Sovereign, there is 'the dominion of reason, peace, security, riches, decency, society, elegancy, sciences and benevolence' (De Cive, chapter 10)

#### Why should we trust our life to unlimited power?
When examining the 20th century, why should we undergo Hobbes' theory?
The answer is simply: civil war is **always** worse than tyranny.

There is several advantages to taking Hobbes seriously:
Well,  Civil war is a catastrophe when it occurs (the Democratic Republic of the Congo civil war 1996-2003 cost more than 5 million lives.)
Secondly, we live in a world of competing moral beliefs, and this makes agreeing on the ends of government extremely difficult.
Modern states do at least in part work like Hobbes' Sovereign: the authority of the law backed by power.

He raises several questions:
**Is conflict between human beings an inescapable part of the human beings?**
**Can moral agreement substitute for political conflict?**
**Why is political life prone to instability?**

___Counter Arguments___

That said, it's not self-evident that civil-war is that destructive *and* the consequences of having a Sovereign as in Saddam Hussein.

#### It's important centrally to consider the context of Hobbes' starting place.
The English civil war between 1642-1651: two massive conflicts between Crown V Parliament and religious differences within Protestantism.
There was Instability: war broke out 1642, and Parliament executed the king, ruled with the army and in 1660 the monarchy returned.
Hobbes' sympathies were monarchist: exile in France but published Leviathan as a plea for the republic's authority to be accepted.

Therein, is Hobbes' main arguments:
1. Human beings have an exceptional capacity to disagree with one another, and there is no possible unified morality to remedy this problem.
2. A lot of language about political authority and power is nonsensical.
3. Human beings are capable of reason, but are more likely to act from their passion and pretend it is reason that is driving them.

>[!Quote] In regard to the problem of language in Politics, Hobbes speaks in Chapter 19 of the Leviathan
>For they that are discontented under Monarchy, call it Tyranny; and they that are displeased with Aristocracy, called it Oligarchy: So also, they which find themselves grieved under a Democracy, call it Anarchy, and yet I think no man believed, that want of Government, is any new kind of Government; nor by the same reason ought they to believe, that the Government is of one kind, when they like it, and another, when they mislike it, or are oppressed by the Governors. 

In a sense, he is both an optimist and a pessimist.

## Lecture 2: Human Nature

Date: 10/10/2023


```ad-important
title: Hobbes' conception of human nature
The desire for power is common to human beings - the means to obtain some future good.
There is a natural equality of human beings.
The beliefs human beings form as inherently problematic because they lack objective foundations.
```

Inside of all of us is a desire for power - the power is the means to obtain some good or desire.

Hobbes says that we have the capacity to kill each other. It's what makes his conception of the 'state of nature' so profound: there is nobody that could be safe from another human being's capacity to kill each other.

Hobbes talks about the 'ants' and 'bees', so we have beliefs and we tend to think of them as moral or religious - and we tend to express ourselves about these beliefs as though they're subjectively true.

This is non-sensical. He thinks that the beliefs that we have is as dangerous as the possibility to kill each other. Hobbes believes that these problems arise because there's no objective foundation to ethical problems.

His starting place is the problem of appetite and desire as the language of good and evil is subjective.

```ad-quote
title: The problem of subjective morality (Leviathan, chapter 6)
"Whatsoever is the object of any mans Appetite or Desire; that it is, which he for his part calleth Good: and the object of his Hate and Aversion, Evill."
```


```ad-quote
title: And this leads to political disorder (Leviathan, chapter 16)
"And divers men, differ not onely in their Judgement, on the senses of what is pleasant, and unpleasant to the taste, smell, hearing, touch, and sight; but also of what is conformable, or disagreeable to Reason, in the actions of common life. Nay, the same man, in divers times, differs from himselfe; and one time praiseth, that is, calleth Good, what another time he dispraiseth, and calleth Evil: **From whence arise Disputes, Controversies, and at last War**."
```

This leads to the state of nature, a state of permanent fear where human beings are always at risk of violent death. Here, we have a **right of nature** to act as we choose to try to survive.

The way therein are the **laws of nature**, "a Precept, or generall Rule, found out by Reason." (Leviathan, chapter 14.)

By the laws of nature, humans are "forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of (their) life, or taketh away the means of preserving the same (Leviathan, chapter 14)"

These act us to procure peace as if we use our reason we will see it as objectively true, and we will act to defend this.

Therefore we must produce a **covenant** where individuals should lay down their right of nature and make a covenant with each other to make peace. This covenant says that individuals give up their right to govern themselves to a sovereign who rules over the commonwealth. These subjects are obliged through this covenant.

The essential exchange of the commonwealth: the subjects give obedience and in exchange get protection and with protection comes civilization. We obey ourselves, as we gave power to the sovereign.

There is no covenant between the sovereign and the subject in setting up the covenant. As we'll see, the sovereign may coerce and frighten the subjects into submission.

When he means sovereign, he means the artificial state: not a single person, but could be a democratic assembly and so on.

But in practice, Hobbes bets more on fear than the covenant. In practice, covenants can't bind us. Therein, fear leads us to recognise the power of an existing sovereign. We know that the sovereign has the power to destroy us if we refuse obedience. The obligation to obey the sovereign in the same in a commonwealth by acquisition as a commonwealth by institutions.


## What can (and should) the sovereign do?

The sovereign can do *anything* to provide peace.
Its authority depends on its power and this comes from the sovereign's command of violence.
The sovereign's authority must be indivisible.

Hobbes allows the sovereign to dictate the terms of religion - and even suggests the preachers cannot dictate that hell doesn't exist. Who would care about staying alive if hell doesn't exist?

For Hobbes, this is the logical starting place to 'seek peace' and the belief that power is impediment to people seeking peace. 

```ad-quote
title: Hobbes about power (Leviathan chapter 18)
"And Covenants without the Sword are but words, and no strength to secure a man at all."
```

### Three forms that the sovereign can take:

It can only be one, few or many and nothing in between (like the Athenians or what lead to English civil war, mixing the Crown and relatively small Parliament): the Sovereign must be a monarchy, an aristocracy or a democracy.
In each case, there is the same relationship between sovereign and subjects: subjects in democracy are no freer than subjects in a monarchy.
Hobbes thought monarchies are less prone to decay.

The relationship of the subject to the sovereign is the same no matter. You are, in all states, free in the gaps between the laws.

In a monarchy the natural person of the monarch, and the artificial of the sovereign, is aligned better with each other: there is less division,

## When the obligation to obey ends for the subject:

This is only thus when the sovereign directly threatens an individual's life, and when the sovereign's power breaks down (as they can no longer protect us).

```ad-info
title: About giving up our lives:
We authorize the sovereign to make laws to protect us.
Therefore, should the sovereign order our deaths, we can rebel.
```

```ad-quote
title: The act of creating a sovereign creates unity where there was none (Leviathan, chapter 16)
"**It is the unity of the representer, not the Unity of the Represented, that maketh the Person One.** And it is the Representer that beareth the Person, and but one person. And Unity cannot otherwise be understood in Multitude."
```

So:

1. Hobbes uses the ideas of representation, not sociability, to solve the fundamental political problem of disagreement and conflict.
2. He creates the idea of a singular person within a state that we can talk about as having a singular will; this people is the sovereign who rules.
3. This makes the unity that exists within the state, embodied in the idea of the sovereign, absolute.

This was subversive as Hobbes justified the power of the state without resorting to any kind of argument of a person having a kind of justification for anyone claiming a natural right to rule over others through wealth, intelligence or divine providence.

Hobbes justified the power of the state having started from the premise that there's no natural unity among human beings.

Contrast with [[Aristotle]], who argues that "Man is by nature a social animal ... society is something that precedes the individual." (Politics)

The problems that leaves:
1. What if there was no rational grounds for agreeing on peace as an objective value?
2. Is he right that the risk of a tyrannical sovereign can be tolerated?

```ad-quote
title: From John Locke (Treatise of Government, 2, para 93)
"This is to think that Men are so foolish that they take care to avoid what Mischiefs may be done to them by polecats or foxes, but are content, nay think it safety, to be devoured by Lions."
```

As though men would rather be eaten by lions as opposed to be hunted by polecats and foxes.
