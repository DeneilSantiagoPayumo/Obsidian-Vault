## Lecture notes:

Fanon: 'Ultracolonialism's rationale', *El Moudjahid*, May 1958:
- Written in the aftermath of the coup d'etat in Algiers on 13 May 1958, in which French dissident army officers and colonial officials (the 'ultras') seized power.

"It is in the nature of colonialism, which set itself up in the hills of the Maghreb one hundred and thirty years ago, to develop all of its contradictions before disappearing. Hit it in its vital centres, it has to give itself over to a fight to the death. No realistic policy, no consideration as regards the people it oppresses, is possible. **The awakening of Maghrebis to the absolute irreducibility of their interests to those of imperialisms impels it towards a pitiless resistance** ... For colonialism in North Africa will henceforth appear in its most virulent and, as it were, primary form. **Rid of the semblance of legality and reason that had prevented it from acting as it pleased ... It will attain its maximum level of aggressiveness and 'efficacy'**. 'Paris cannot save us, let us save ourselves!' the ultras cried. Which means: the colonial beast must be unbridled, leave it unto itself, unto its blindness and its instincts.

"The intermediary does not lighten the oppression, nor seek to hide the domination; he shows them up and puts them into practice with the clear conscience of an upholder of the peace; yet he is the bringer of violence into the home and into the mind of the native." (p.29)

"**the bringer of violence into the ... mind of the native." 

"The effect consciously sought by colonialism was to drive into the natives' heads the idea that **if the settlers were to leave, they would at once fall back into barbarism, degradation, and beastiality.** On the unconscious plane, colonialism therefore did not seek to be considered by the native as a gentle, loving mother who protects her child from a hostile environment, but **rather as a mother who unceasingly restrains her fundamentally perverse offspring from managing to commit suicide from giving free rein to its evil instincts.** The colonial mother protects her child from itself, from its ego, and from its physiology, its biology, and its own unhappiness which is its very essence." (p. 169)

**every time Western values are mentioned they produce ... muscular lockjaw**

"when the native hears a speech about Western culture he pulls out his knife - or at least he makes sure it is within reach. The violence with which the supremacy of white values is affirmed and the aggressiveness which has permeated the victory of these values over the ways of life and of thought of the native mean that, in revenge, **the native laughs in mockery when Western values are mentioned in front of him.**"

"By its laziness and will to imitation, it promotes the ingrafting and stiffening of racism which was characteristic of the colonial era." (p.130)

"We are not dealing with the old antagonism between town and country; **it is the antagonism which exists between the native who is excluded from the advantages of colonialism and his counterpart who manages to turn colonial exploitation to his account**." (p. 89).
-> the lumpenproletariat as a force of change.

"It is a question of the third world starting a new history of Man ... [L]et us not pay tribute to Europe by creating states, institutions, and societies which draw their inspiration from her. Humanity is waiting for something from us other than such an imitation..." (p. 254)
