### Why does Gandhi matter?

1. Critic of the imperial modern state and the modern state itself
2. Critic of violence as a political means for overthrowing the imperial modern state.
3. Developed a specific peaceful means of resistance to the modern state's authority: satygraha.
4. Offered an alternative to Hobbes' sovereign and repudiated Hobbes' premises
5. Articulated a political response to European imperialism that claimed the pre-imperial period back

## Hind Swaraj

Gandhi wrote the book in Gujarati in ten days at sea returning from London to Transvaal in November 1909.

His own English translation was published in 1910.

Little effect outside of South Africa.

It was a contrast of the Bengalese writer Rabindranath Tagore who in was the first non-European to win the Noble prizes.

In this book, he argues that:
1. India should be *swaraj* as self-rule, not *swaraj* as an Indian modern state.
2. Ancient civilisation is superior to modern industrial civilisation and can be restored
3. Political change must come through non-violence and individuals living truthfully on a daily life according to religious ascetic principles. 

```ad-seealso
title: The impact of John Ruskin
For the first half of his life, [[Gandhi]] lived an entirely urban life. He read [[John Ruskin]]'s *Unto This Life* in 1904 - a moral critique of the Industrial REvolution, materialist political economy, and argued honour in life came from working on the land.

Gandhi believed to change his life in accordance to the ideals of this book. So he bought the Phoenix Farm outside Durham.
```

He detests modern industrial civilisation: people like Ricardo, Jeremy Bentham, James MIll and argued.

```ad-seealso
title: The impact of Leo Tolstoy

Gandhi first read [[Tolstoy]]'s *The Kingdom of God is Within You* in 1984.
He made the Sermon on the Mount the centre of Christianity.
For Tolstoy, **Christianity was incompatible with the modern state and, political change depends on inner moral change towards 'the kingdom of God'**
```

Can we look at [[Thomas Hobbes]] - Christianity, source of civil warfare and strife. Political change for Tolstoy is a moral change on the kingdom of God.

```ad-seealso
title: The Phoenix Settlement
"Phoenix is intended to a nursery for producing the right men (and women) and right Indians."
Moved the journal - Indian Opinion - he ran to the farm too, including all the machinery for printing.
Aim was self-sufficiency working the land.
Established cottages, a school, and a clinic.
**The Kingdom of God is Within You** was mandatory reading.
```






## Historical Context for Gandhi's arguments

### Gandhi as an Indian

1869 - Gandhi was born in Gujarat under the direct rule of the British Raj (ruled by British crown directly instead of East India company)
1885 - Indian National Congress formed by a former Raj official to give voice to educated and largely Hindu Indian national opinion.
1905 - the Raj portioned Bengal into a majority-Hindu western territory and a majority-Muslim eastern territory.
1905: the Swadeshi movement protested partition by boycotting foreign-produced goods - British-produced goods.

This is something that will come to the fore when we talk about independence. India and Pakistan. This is a forewarning of what is to come. There was such resistance that the British had to abolish the Raj.

This will affect Gandhi's ideas about national self-sufficiency. That is the general backdrop of Gandhi as an Indian.

This is really important to see - Gandhi did not know this India. He **left India in 1888** and was largely away until 1915. He arrived in London in 1909 just after an Indian revolutionary assassinate da British Indian Army Officer.

He argued thereof that:
1. How what a future independent India he did not know well should be:
2. To oppose Indian revolutionaries committed to violence as the means to end British rule.

Violence is not the way forward. Even though he's out of Indian politics, living a life in South Africa and London, he's trying to make an intervention in India about what the path towards independence should be, noting that Gandhi isn't committed just yet.

### Gandhi as an Asian

1905 - Japan triumphed over Russia by sinking the Russian fleet in the Battle of Tsushima. For the first time in centuries a non-European power had defeated a European power, as Russia was then seen, in a large-scale battle.

```ad-quote
title: Quoted in Manfred Steger, Gandhi's DIlemma
What, then, is the secret of this epic heroism? We have repeatedly to ask ourselves this question and find an answer for it. The answer is: unity, patriotism and the resolve to do or die. All the Japanese are animated by the same spirit ... they think nohing else but service to the nation ... of death, they do not entertain any fear ... our reading of the Japanese War will have been fruitful only if we emulate to some extent at least the example of Japan.
```



### Gandhi as an Indian British subject in the settler colony of South Africa

1. South Africa created from the British colonies of Natal (annexed from the Boers 1843), Transvaal, Orange River (won in 1902 Boer War) and Cape (first taken 1795 and again 1806)
2. While settlement in the future South Africa started in 17 th century under the Dutch East Indies Company and then British settlement in Cape from 1810 s.
3. Diamonds discovered in 1867 and gold in 1884 in Transvaal, increasing white and Indian settlement, displacement of the native population, and deployment of Africans in mines.
4. Indians first came to the Natal colony as indentured labourers from the 1860 s.
5. Later Indian merchants settled in Natal, Transvaal, and the Cape as subjects of the British Crown.
6. In 1883, population of Natal in 1883: 8 per cent British; 6 per cent Indian; 85 percent Zulu. 

Gandhi in Natal and Transvaal (1893-1906) came as a lawyer for a Muslim trading company, forming the Natal Indian Congress in 1894 to campaign for rights for Indian merchants as settlers on the same basis as white British settlers.

1893-1905 practised politics by petitioning, journalism and meeting.

Organised an Indian Ambulance Corps during the Second Boer War (1899-1902) and the Zulu Rebellion in Natal (1906) to support the British crown.

He appealed to what he believed was an ideal of the empire evident in Britain and absent in Natal:

```ad-quote
title: Quoted in Guha, Gandhi before India
I have … to remind you that the English in England have shown by their writings, speech, and deeds that they mean to unify the hearts of the two peoples, that they do not believe in colour distinctions, and that they will raise India with them, rather than rise upon its ruins.’
```

```ad-quote
title: Quoted in Guha, Gandhi before India
He opposed a tax demanded to avoid re-indenture as ‘in direct opposition to the fundamental principles upon which the British constitution is based.’ (Quoted in Guha, Gandhi before India)
```

We go to his proclamation to Queen Victoria: he called it a magna carter for British Indians. 

```ad-quote
title: Queen Vicky:
Queen Victoria’s proclamation: ‘[This Crown and Empire were] bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to all our other subjects. … And it is our further will that, so far as may be, our subjects, of whatever race or creed, be freely admitted to officers in our service, the duties of which may be qualified, by their education, ability, integrity, duly to discharge.’
```

He was very interested in the plight of the Indians ... not so much with the native South Africans.

1. Saw in Natal and Transvaal a chasm between what he had taken as the imperial ideal and the reality of a colony organised around a racial hierarchy.
2. In that hierarchy Indians were closer to Africans in than to the Europeans and Gandhi had little interest in the subjugation of the African population.

He changes tactics and political scene: in mid-1900s, he saw:
1. Political tactics to satygraha
2. India should not imitate Japan
3. With discovery of Ruskin, against modern industrial civilisation which is now tied to empire
4. It was because of British materialism that the British could subordinate the large numerical native majority in Natal and Transvaal

The centrality of this idea that the law is immoral.

Satyagraha and imprisonment - 1906, he organised civil disobedience against Indian Registration Act, 1908 adopted the terms 'satygraha' and was imprisoned twice.

Satyagraha:
1. Passive resistance is a method of securing rights by personal suffering
2. It demands a sacrifice of self
3. Conditions: chastity, poverty, fearlessness and truthfulness...

## Be Asian but don't be Japan

Reader: As Japan is, so must India be.
Editor: You want the tiger but not the tiger's nature ... This is not the swaraj I want.
To arm India on a large scale is to Europeanise it.
I believe that the civilisation India has evolved is not to be beaten in the world ... Japan has become westernised, of China nothing is to be said, but India is still, somehow or other, sound at the foundation. (Hind Swaraj)

The materialism has swept a lot of that Indian civilisation away - what he thought, what was a crucial tension - an Indian civilisation is not to be beaten, this is Imperial China but India is sound at the foundation. There is a core spirituality that has survived in India in the experience of European industrialisation. 

## Critique of modern civilisation in Hind Swaraj

1. Modern industrial civilisation - ‘the kingdom of Satan’ - was ‘irreligion’ driven only by money and a concern for ‘bodily welfare’.
2. *‘It is a civilisation only by name. Under it the nations of Europe are becoming degraded and ruined day by day’ and ‘India is becoming irreligious’.*
3. In industrialisation civilisation humans had usurped God by transcending the limits God set to humans' 'locomotive ambition’ in their bodies,
4. *‘Good travels at a snail’s pace – it can therefore have little to do with the railways. But evil has wings.’*
5. *‘Machinery is the chief symbol of modern civilisation. It represents a great sin.’*

At its heart it is much more spiritual than that - it continues in parenthesis. Gandhi thought that what God had done was to limit our locomotive ambition, our ability to move ourselves and what the railway has done is to move ourselves through much greater distance than otherwise.

The whole idea of the railway is that it violates the nature of creation, the relationship of God and human and beings.

## The value of ancient civilisation

1. Ancient civilisation were religious at core and had a purpose
2. India's ancient civilisation - '*the kingdom of God*' because of its strength survived intact
3. The spiritual truths of the ancient Indian civilisation and the 'sovereign soul' were the source of resistance.
4. Gandhi's demand to the British: 'We want our own ancient schools and courts to be restored.'

Hobbes' whole argument that he wants creatures to tell their congregation that there's no such thing as hell for their soul for eternity. This is the **exact** opposite of that - he was making political demands, we want our own ancient schools, we don't want to Indianize these states. We want to go back to the world we came from.

The singularity of this attempt to resurrect the lost past: an Asian response to the European imperial era.

Chen Duxiu: co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party:
"I would rather see the past culture of our nation disappear than se eour face die out because of its unfitness for living in the world" - Quoted in Mishra, From the Ruins of Empire.

## Lecture notes:

## Satyagraha in *Hind Swaraj*

- "Passive resistance is a method of securing rights by personal suffering"
- It demands "sacrifice of self"
- Conditions: chastity, poverty, fearlessness and truthfulness.

The Tolstoy farm was a preparation for satyagraha:
- Second communal farm with which Gandhi was engaged
- The land bought by his Jewish friend
- Those who lived there were of multiple religious faiths and provided for themselves with their own labour.

Satyagraha led the British Viceroy to support Gandhi's campaign for Indian rights in Transvaal. 

In 1915:
1. Established an ashram, rather than cultivating Congress leaders
2. 1917-1919: used satyagraha in local conflicts while supporting Britain in World War 1
3. 1920: he led an All-India satyagraha with strikes and fasts against emergency powers law after the Amritsar massacre
4. Nehru - "This was something very different from our daily politics of condemnation and nothing else ... This was the politics of action, not of talk.

The Salt Satyagrahaa:
1. 1920 s: the Indian National Congress made Satyagraha its means to win more self-government and put Gandhi in charge.
2. Gandhi chose the Salt Tax and Salt Crown Monopoly as the target: ‘Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life’.
3. 1930 Salt Satyagraha: a march over 200 miles of all religions and castes and men and women with colonial police beating protestors.
4. . Left Raj officials bewildered as to how to respond, but they did not make any significant concessions and 1934 Congress ended the policy.
5. What changed was Indian engagement with Congress: started with 78 marchers and ended with millions of acts of disobedience.

Gandhi and World War 2:
1942 British disaster: February 1942 Singapore fell; May 1942 Burma fell.
- Widespread belief that Japan would next invade India at same time as Nazi Germany controlled continental Europe and heading for the Caucasus.
- August 1942 Gandhi launched the Quit India movement immediate British departure with Satyagraha as the means.
- August 1942: first formation of the Indian National Army by Indian Japanese Prisoners of War who had served in the British Indian Army.
- Gandhi: if Japan invaded there should be Satyagraha against them too.

Satyagraha against power with no limits:
- The Raj moved to emergency powers and imprisoned the Indian National Congress leadership including Gandhi.
- Nehru had opposed Gandhi: no good could come from siding with fascists. 
- The Muslim League opposed the Quit India Satyagraha, strengthening its demand for a state of Pakistan.
- It was the breakdown of loyalty in the British Indian Army that with Britain’s wartime bankruptcy broke British imperial rule in India.

## Subsequent failure?

By British withdrawal, Gandhi was isolated within congress:
- Gandhi to Nehru, 5 October 1945: ‘I am convinced that if India is to attain true freedom and through India the world also, then sooner or later the fact must be recognised that people will have to live in villages.’
- Nehru to Gandhi, 9 October 1945: ‘It is 38 years since Hind Swaraj was written. The world has completely changed since then, possibly in a wrong direction. In any event, any consideration of these questions must keep present facts, forces and the human material we have today in view, otherwise it will be divorced from reality.’

Then, the partition of India and Pakistan that destroyed the ideal of India.

Tension in Gandhi’s idea of a unified Indian nationhood when he wanted to restore ancient civilisation.
- Gandhi: ‘We were one nation long before they [the British] came to India.’
- Saw this in the fact that places of pilgrimage were established in the north, south, east, and west, and argued this religious geography reflected nature.
- But this historical story centred on ancient Hindu India before there were Muslims, Parsis, Sikhs, and Christians in India.
- Response: ‘India cannot cease to be a nation because people belonging to different religions live in it. The introduction of foreigners does not necessarily destroy the nation, they merge in it. … a country must have a facility for assimilation.’
- For Gandhi cumulative history with an ancient origin had made Indian a continuously religious nation that could preserve itself against industrial civilisation.

[[Max Weber]] would've hated him - the ethic of conviction over the ethics of responsibility. A saint, not a political leader.

[[Thomas Hobbes]] would've hated him - choosing conscience and death over obedience and life was against the rule of nature.

Contrasting Hobbes' premise:
- There is no underlying religious conflict between human beings - religions are different road converging to the same point
- While there is religious conflict in the world, religious superstition is harmless compared to that of modern civilisation
- Hobbes wanted religious beliefs prescribed, Gandhi insisted religious orientations cannot be discarded.

Without Gandhi's asceticism, the peace counter-cultural movement fell away and became a brand. His legacy now lies with ascetic-based environmentalism:
1. Offering a critique of bodily material welfare as the basis of value politics and the rejection of natural limits
2. Made food consumption a political and not just religious question.
