High living standards and representative democracy

Acemoglu and Robinson - Inequalities can be explained principally through economic and political institutions, not geography or culture

Extractive institutions vs Inclusive institutions; proposed as a binary

Extractive - A small elite controls the resources of a state or prevents the development of a centralised state

Inclusive - Constitutional rules, democracy and the institutional spread of power

Creative destruction allows for economic change/development; only tends to be possible in inclusive economies

‘The countries that did not take advantage of new technologies did not benefit from the other engines of prosperity…This failure was due to their extractive institutions, either a consequence of the persistence of their absolutist regimes or because they lacked centralised states’

Extractive political + inclusive economic may equal short-term prosperity

Comparison 1:

North vs South Korea:

- Shared cultural history until very recently

- Minimal geographic differences

- North Korea heavily agrarian society; 8x the infant mortality rate

Comparison 2:

United States vs Mexico; Nagales

- United States’ high living standards due to its continued reliance on democracy; Mexico’s relationship with it far more complicated

Comparison 3:

Europe vs China

- Everything changes in the 16th century

- China by far the most advanced, until it banned foreign trade and shipbuilding at the same time as the European Age of Exploration

- 1661: Removal of the population of Southern China

Comparison 4:

England vs Spain

- Henry VII creates a centralised English state, around the same time that Castile and Aragon united

- Spanish crown enriched by colonial riches; England is as well, but the benefits are spread more widely amongst merchants

- 1688-89 - English Parliament deposes James II, limits monarchical power and encourages economic pluralism

- 1520s - Spanish Parliament begins a failed revolt

- England industrialises; Spain goes into an extensive period of economic decline

- Links to America as all the benefits of English prosperity translate there; opposite is the case for South America

Comparison 5:

Africa vs the world

- 16th century; Saharan slave trade most significant

- 18th century; Atlantic slave trade around 10x more significant

Dispute - was the 16th century truly a success for Europe?

- Rise of the Ottomans; so must be refined to Western Europe

- In 1775, the Mughal Empire was the largest manufacturing empire in the world

- China had a far larger share of world GDP in the 18th century

- 16th century silver trade was the first truly world economy, and China was the centre of it all

1689 Declaration of Right: ‘All and singular the rights and liberties asserted and claimed in the said declaration, are the true, ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom’

Suggests reclamation rather than a novel revolution

100 years from the Glorious Revolution to the industrial revolution; why the long wait?

Geographical abundance of coal?

Then a maritime extractive empire?

China has recently combined authoritarian political institutions and rapid economic growth driven initially by maritime trade

**Democracy and Violence and Democracy and Peace**

## Lecture notes:

To understand the Democratic Peace came to be in popular consciousness, it must be linked to the context it is created - understood in a Cold War Theory.

- The "club of democracies"
- The effects of US hegemony over allies
- The self-justifying story of democracy's superiority

It is an account of a group of states that identify each other as a term of democracy, understood in a context of it's so-called opponent - Communism. That there are the democratic states, and that there are the Communist states. Those that are democracies understand and identify themselves in those terms.

The idea that the democratic peace has an empirical evidence but not causal evidence is brought out within the literature, existing in the context of a certain group of states that identify with the character of democracy in a series of political alliances,

This affirms the idea of democracy's superiority within the cold war context, the idea that the democratic peace approach is a self-fulfilling story told by Western powers that laud the power of democratic forms of government over other forms of government.

It is also a post-Cold War theory of democracy: the process of democratisation, the End of History arguments ([[Fukuyama]]) and the spreading of 'ethnic war'.

States seem to have engaged in a process of democratisation and state collapse, simultaneously or not where authoritarian leaders are replaced and gave and had limited control over the territories they were controlling, leading to the proliferation of criminal organisations around the world. 

The process of democratisation is often followed by violence - new democracies, countries in which democratic processes are starting up are prone to external and internal violence both in the periods.

See: the Yugoslav Wars (Croat-Bosniak war) and the Nagorno-Karabakh war (Armenia-Aazerbaijan))

In that context at least, there is a context that democracy and democratisation has become part of spreading the conflict. In the context groups outside of the territory of the state become important players, either to exclude or include them in processes of defining the people. If democracy is centred around the idea of the people, the context of who people are become the\central struggle.

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s articles:

1. Citizens bear the costs of war
2. Citizens recognise other free peoples do not want war either
3. The preference of citizens direct state policy.

Politicians, seeking to avoid unpopularity, seek to avoid conflict from occurring. Perhaps the most quoted paragraph in Kant's text:

```ad-quote
title: Kant, Political Writings, p.100
"If ... the consent of citizens is requried to decide whether or not war is to be declared, it is very natural that they will have great hesitation in embarking on so dangerous an enterprise. For ths would mean calling down on themselves all the miseries of war, such as doing the fighting themselves, supplying the costs of the war from their own resources, painfully making good the ensuing devastation."
```

Assumption: politicians pay attention to public opinion.

There are several problems with this argument: most obviously, with step 3, that popular opinion directs state policy. Generally, most criticism follows on the first two explanations and it follows on the nature of law.

Contemporary war also follows different wars:
1. The prevalence of proxy wars and indirect commitment to war

War has become asymmetric which has led to a different scale of burdens. The financial burden of war fighting is minimal. The argument then that populations are driven by the fear of costs and the fear of such is a more speculative argument that didn't happen - there is no consequences for NATO states (see Serbia).

The indirectness of the war becomes how war is fought.  (See US support for Pakistan in the 1971 war with India)

This is the first go at the argument, but where Kant takes the argument later (picked up by Doyle later) is his separate argument for why democracies are peaceful.

His second explanation:
1. Political right: representative government
2. International right: a rules-based order
3. Cosmopolitan right: interdependence.

This is where laws are established. This is how representative governments function compared to despotic governments. Representative government sets out rights and sets out understandings of what those rights shall be, with a legislature that defines those laws and holds them in executive account.

That's the idea of the separation of power: a law-making body retains the power to chain the executive and keep the executive bound within its scope for action.

Kant's second step - international rights. This is based around a federation of states that serve to increase the conflict of states within each other. States can function because they trust one another to abide by those rules.

Also, the Cosmopolitan rights: the fact that there are opportunities for people to know each other. People still living in nation-states live with awareness that other people are not like themselves: they have trade with them, commerce, at least forms of interdependence that other people rely on each other.

A set of independent constraints that overlap with each other and dependent on each other. Interdependence creates a guarantee of perpetual peace. When people explain Kant's arguments, they do so in that order. In this way the best explanation is a reverse of that: start 3, move to two. This is why this argument is the way for global democracy.

Interdependence for Kant can only be established in a rules-based order: one can only develop Cosmopolitan linkages if there's a rule based order to back up those leaders. Interdependence must be articulated at the level of federation.

The central argument Kant is making is the character of liberal democracy - that a liberal democracy is in some ways has the features associated with it, the idea of representation and a separation of powers.

Problems about the ideas of liberal democracy:
Well, it makes the executive accountable to the legislative body but... in matters of war? It is an idea that in some sense helps us understand the republic, in terms of what we call a liberal democracy.

There are many things that are outside the control of the legislative that do not have checks on it at an executive level. A liberal democracy cannot guarantee control over a state's foreign policy: it does not match up to a common feature of modern democracy. In that way, democracies have unbound executives where centralised powers cannot be checked through domestic legislation.

See, the Kargil war, May-July 1999 (India-Pakistan). Two states fighting for a relatively isolated spot in the two countries, a war that lasted three months between the two states. India by any accounts is an established democracy. Pakistan had democratic elements that ended in the 1980s. Those institutions had limited control over the military.

In that sense, one could argue that there are many contexts in which military or other leaders could 'act' without the oversight of the legislation.

Additionally, republican constitution as combining popular rule with individual rights. This comes out with the concept of liberal democracies: the idea of multiple individual rights can sit alongside each other. It is a compromise for two different ways of thinking, the ideas about popular rule inherited from the Ancient Greece, and the ideas that the Mass have the authority to make decisions, combined with the idea of liberal rights in the sense that individual have rights that separate themselves from the community. Rights that have to be protected even if the population at large don't recognise it.

The ambiguity is underlined in Serbia or Pakistan in our 1999 examples: unstable, political acts. Serbia becomes more authoritarian and persecutes governments.

Further:
1. Violent democracies (politics of exclusion)
2. Coexistence of peace and violence
3. Democratic identity through war-making?
