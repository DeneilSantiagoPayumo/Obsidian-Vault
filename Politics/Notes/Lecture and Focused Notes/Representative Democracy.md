High living standards and representative democracy

Acemoglu and Robinson - Inequalities can be explained principally through economic and political institutions, not geography or culture

Extractive institutions vs Inclusive institutions; proposed as a binary

Extractive - A small elite controls the resources of a state or prevents the development of a centralised state

Inclusive - Constitutional rules, democracy and the institutional spread of power

Creative destruction allows for economic change/development; only tends to be possible in inclusive economies

‘The countries that did not take advantage of new technologies did not benefit from the other engines of prosperity…This failure was due to their extractive institutions, either a consequence of the persistence of their absolutist regimes or because they lacked centralised states’

Extractive political + inclusive economic may equal short-term prosperity

Comparison 1:

North vs South Korea:

- Shared cultural history until very recently

- Minimal geographic differences

- North Korea heavily agrarian society; 8x the infant mortality rate

Comparison 2:

United States vs Mexico; Nagales

- United States’ high living standards due to its continued reliance on democracy; Mexico’s relationship with it far more complicated

Comparison 3:

Europe vs China

- Everything changes in the 16th century

- China by far the most advanced, until it banned foreign trade and shipbuilding at the same time as the European Age of Exploration

- 1661: Removal of the population of Southern China

Comparison 4:

England vs Spain

- Henry VII creates a centralised English state, around the same time that Castile and Aragon united

- Spanish crown enriched by colonial riches; England is as well, but the benefits are spread more widely amongst merchants

- 1688-89 - English Parliament deposes James II, limits monarchical power and encourages economic pluralism

- 1520s - Spanish Parliament begins a failed revolt

- England industrialises; Spain goes into an extensive period of economic decline

- Links to America as all the benefits of English prosperity translate there; opposite is the case for South America

Comparison 5:

Africa vs the world

- 16th century; Saharan slave trade most significant

- 18th century; Atlantic slave trade around 10x more significant

Dispute - was the 16th century truly a success for Europe?

- Rise of the Ottomans; so must be refined to Western Europe

- In 1775, the Mughal Empire was the largest manufacturing empire in the world

- China had a far larger share of world GDP in the 18th century

- 16th century silver trade was the first truly world economy, and China was the centre of it all

1689 Declaration of Right: ‘All and singular the rights and liberties asserted and claimed in the said declaration, are the true, ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom’

Suggests reclamation rather than a novel revolution

100 years from the Glorious Revolution to the industrial revolution; why the long wait?

Geographical abundance of coal?

Then a maritime extractive empire?

China has recently combined authoritarian political institutions and rapid economic growth driven initially by maritime trade
