## Lecture notes:

## A short biography

She experienced a very tumultuous life as a German woman, is a Zionist, and is best known for her books after the war.

## *The Origins of Totalitarianism* (1951, 1958)

It is presented in three parts: Antisemitism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism.
She wanted to show that Antisemitism isn't a German phenomenon - this could have happened in France. In the section in Imperialism, she discusses how Europeans when they're engaging in Imperialism, they begin to do things that are unconsciousable - for example, concentration camps so they can put whole populations into camp. What the totalitarians are doing, in terms of the suspension of human rights, have already done by the Europeans overseas. They're willing and able to do the atrocities in the world that Europeans were afraid of doing.

This is the big book she publishes in 1951. She removes the previous conclusion and adds two chapters - one on terror and one on Hungarian uprising in 1958.

## *The Human Condition* (1958)

Three central concepts:
- Labour
- Work
- Action

Three major parts: Natality and plurality, the public and private, the rise of the social.

In plurality she means the lives we lead. She is interested in morality - that everybody and everything is going to die and part of what she's interested in is how human beings can do things that endure, make a difference that endures our morality. She is also interested in natality - we don't know how human lives will lead, what will happen, that we cannot conceive of it. Every life is open-ended and every life has possibility of bringing new things into the world.

She's interested in the distinction between the public and private. We will talk later about this.

She is mainly interested in talking about these three central concepts. These were the three concepts that drive the assumption and discussion of the book and drives 'the human condition.' 


```ad-quote
title: Labour
"**Labor is the activity that corresponds to the biological process of the human body**, whose spontaneous growth, metabolism, and eventual decay are bound to the vital life necessities produced and fed into the life process by labor. **The human condition of labor is life itself.**"
```

She is thinking about our fundamental needs of our lives - buying groceries, going outside and so on. What has been associated with the idea of women's work, we're not thinking in the wrong direction - labour is typically what goes on in households, what goes on in private, the world of washing, cooking, cleaning, child-bearing.

```ad-quote
title: Work
**"Work is the activity which corresponds to the unnaturalness of human existence,** which is not imbedded in, and whose mortality is not compensated by, the species ever-recurring life-cycle. **Work provides an "artificial" world of human things,** distinctly different from all natural surroundings. Within its borders each individual life is housed, while this world itself is meant to outlast and transcend them all. **The human condition of work is worldliness.**
```

The human condition to work: people consciously making alterations, making objects that will endure through time. This is the way people express themselves in the production of objects.

```ad-quote
title: Action
"**Action**, the only activity that goes on directly between man without the intermediary of things or matter, **corresponds to the human condition of pluraltiy,** to the fact that men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world. While all aspects of the human condition are somehow related to politics, **this plurality is specifically the condition ... of all political life....** Plurality is the condition of human action because we are all the same, that is, human, in such a way that nobody will be the same as anyone else who lived, lives, or will live." 
```

Actions - doing things that will make you last. We are all the same and yet all unique.

We can think of them as [[Max Weber]]'s ideal-types: not an exclusive and exhaustive categorization of human activity.

```ad-example
title: The Trifecta
We can think of baking a cake as labour. We can deorating it with skill and imagination so it is art as work, and presenting it as a present to my beloved? Action.
```

We can also think of her as a critic of [[Karl Marx]].
The ide that in his anthropology, Marx conflates work and labour and doesn't see them distinctive kinds of activity. When he writes "Labour is life's prime want", Arendt would argue that this is completely implausible even if we substitute labour for work.

This is true for the world of work, but Arendt argues that this is not plausible for the world of human activity: this is the work of drudgery and necessity.

## Arendt on Politics

Arendt wants us to think about ancient Athenian democratic politics. She believes that the ancients understood something important about politics that has been smothered over - this has to do with politics as a space of human action, involving deliberation among equals in public, with an eye in generating power.

Power is people coming together to do things *together*. Politics is this nature of doing action. We have the rise of the social - the world of private, production, concentration camps, domestic camps but work of the holocaust allows the citizens to be an equal among equal among political relations. Arendt worries that people are increasingly preoccupied in the world of trade unions and food, regulation and what goes wrong if we pay too much attention to the social we forget that politics is about freedom, deliberation, human beings collectively writing their own script together, too concerned about business and biological. This is important work to be sure but it's not politics and if we think politics can be reduced to the activity of welfare, GDP, economic activity, something has gone wrong: laudable goals, better to have food than not, but if we confine our imagination to this we lose sight of what politics is and can be. The realm of human freedom is gone.

## Arendt and [[Judith Shklar]] on Revolution

She thinks that there's this force after state power has been cracked, there is this moment where revolutionaries must decide what to do through deliberation. They are writing the script and its not clear how the story will end. That's the moment of genuine political freedom. She is interested in the dynamics of revolution.

The American Revolution is better than the French - the Americans changed their political regimes, but the structure of society stays the same. In those spaces, free public deliberation comes to end.
