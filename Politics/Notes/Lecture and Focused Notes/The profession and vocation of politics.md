## Lecture notes:

He was invited by a group of students at Munich university.
He did not fall easily on any political camps - sympathetic to socialism but critical of it.
This lecture will focus on Weber's account of the state and modern politics.
Next lecture will focus on Weber's context to understand his argument about ethics.

What does the name suggest: "Politik als Beruf" - a spiritual calling, commitment (vocation) job, trade, occupation (profession)

## The state

Weber defines the state as:
```ad-quote
title: Weber, pp.310-11 of Weber: Political Writings

"A state is that human community which (successfully) lays claim to the monopoly of legitimate physical violence within a certain territory."


```

The structure of the lecture comes from defining politics and types of legitimacy (309-313), then talks about the emergence of the modern state (313-352), the life of the politician and then ethics (352-369).

Politics is the politics of the state

```ad-quote
title: The definition of the state
"**Nowadays, by contrast** we have to say that a state is that **human community** which lays claim to the monopoly of legitimate physical violence within a certain territory, this 'territory' being another of the defining characteristic of the state."

...

"The state is a relationship of rule by human being over human beings, and one that rests on the legitimate use of violence ... those who are ruled must submit to authority"
```

A relationship of the state between the ruler and the ruled.
A state is a state if even the form of government changes - if federalisation comes about, then we have the same state just a different relationship of government.

One that differentiates between Weber and Hobbes is that the use of violence is authorized by something that represents the state. It is the only form of violence that is seen as legitimate is authorized by the state - the exclusivity of violence.

If it is commonly said that violence is legitimate if authorized by the state, and adherence to that.

How is legitimacy acquired:
1. Custom - traditional rule
2. Rational Legality - rationality devised rules
3. Charisma - personal devotion to the qualities of a leadership of an individual.

Weber uses a historical account of the state - the state as a creation of a particular period in time, as it is now but not as it was in the past or the future. Hobbes says people 'must' submit to the state whereas Weber says people *do* submit to the state.

'Disenchantment' - a theme taken by Weber is to account for the unique nature of modernity: bureaucratisation, the modern law. We encounter knowledge that we can't justify, what happens when we engage, we see how agreeable it is to our own solutions.

Bureaucracy is developed by political apparatus, the process of disenchantment creates bureaucracy - a central organizer, forces. It is a resilient force that organizes our social life.

He describes it as a 'steel-hard casing', indicating a level of fixity and structure and tact.

The professionalisation of politics: living for and living from politics, but not officialdom - advocates journalists and demagogues.

There are only a certain *type* of politician in the modern world and no one else.
There is a distinction between those who live for Politics, and those who live from Politics - those who want to rise and do higher levels of Politics, and those who want to retreat into their private lives.

They aren't positive or bad, this is a world in which people have to gain an income and salary to live from Politics but they must have political goals to gain improvement in the world.

This distinguishes the political politician from the official - one who has their own values and one who works for the government.

This form of bureaucratization and otherwise is the 'organizing force of contemporary political life.' For Weber, political parties are the central organizing principle for political life.

Centrally, how that state will be run is what's incredibly important: who is running the state, what sort of training will those people have, and so on.

```ad-quote
title: Weber on charismatic leaders (351)
The only choice lies between a leadership democracy with a machine and a democracy without a ruler, which means rule by the 'professional politician' who lacks precisely those inner charismatic qualities that make a leader.

```

```ad-quote
title: Weber on violence:
collapse: closed
"The specific means of legitimate violence per se in the hands of human associations is what gives all the ethical problems of politics their particular character."
```
