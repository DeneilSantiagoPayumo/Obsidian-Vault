## Otto Neurath
- Vienna Circle; positivism
- With his wife, they end up in exile in Britain when fleeing from the Nazis
- System of visual representation known as isotypes; precursor to emojis - visual communication very important
- Becomes economics minister in Bavaria, trying to turn it into a communist economy
- Leaders of the revolution put on trial; Neurath escaped prison
- Max Weber gave him a character reference which allowed him to escape serious punishment
- In economics, as in every area of life, we always make value-laden incremental decisions
- The economist’s desire to make everything abstract and quantitative is deeply wrong
- We build schools simply because of a desire to learn, rather than simply because we have a certain number of ‘education units’
- *Through War Economy to Economy in Kind*
- [[Von Mises]] - responds with Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth
- [[Max Weber]] - responds with what he believes Neurath is getting wrong in E*conomy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology*
- ‘It is only with the greatest caution that the results and methods of war economy can be used as a basis for criticising the substantive rationality of forms of economic organisation’
- Wartime and peacetime economy simply cannot be equated
- Almost an abstract debate, concerning worldwide socialism

## Origins of Socialist Calculation Debate:

- Reasons we cannot plan an economy on socialist lines because there was not the computing power

Classical Political Economy (1776-1848)
Critique of Political Economy (Marx)
Neo-Classical Economics (late 19th century; far more mathematics based)

Austrian Tradition of Economics:
- Survives to the present; heterodox economics
- Distinctive in its huge support for the free market
- Resisted mathematisation
- Weber is plausibly an ‘Austrian economist’

Socialist Economics:
- **Taylor, Lange, Dobb and Lerner**
- Focus on efficiency

Hayek’s Contributions:
- *Collectivist Economic Planning*
- Many critical articles
- Pre-empted the publication of economic models
- Economists are not entitled to believe that their models are sound; the market is a gigantic information processing system. We go wrong when we think of it as something else.
- We cannot plan an economy:

1. Because it would be inefficient to collate necessary information
2. Literally impossible to know everything we need to know to understand a discipline as broad as economics

The interwar period of the 1930s, Capitalism didn't seem to do so well and there was a sort of confidence around socialists.

German hyperinflation 1922-23

There was a widespread loss of confidence in the ability of Capitalism to deliver. Whereas, the Soviet Union was going strong! Lenin and Trotsky steered the Bolshevik regime.

Keynes and Hayek believed each other had a wacky view on economics. That said, Keynes believed in Hayek's argument - that 'morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it.'

The dedication - To The Socialists of All Parties. He wanted to push back against currents of thoughts.

This is not an argument against Marxism. Chief in Hayek's line of thought is the French 19th century Socialist tradition (Henri de Saint-Simon who). Hayek's argument doesn't speak for Marxists. Marxists just believed communism was historically apt. Hayek rather speaks to the modern Marxists, left-liberals, those who *do* want to make arguments on freedom, equality, justice and so on. In some ways, Hayek and the Marxists are talking past the other.

## Hayek as a troll....?

He likes to stir up discourse:
1. Government subsidies and bail-outs (Say NO to affirmative action!)
2. Social Justice (Say NO to ... moral pluralism. We don't know what social justice truly means.)
3. The power of the most junior official in the planning ministry (Say NO to those that have disproportionate power over industries... if we don't like monopoly, we shouldn't like planning!)
4. International economies and the global poor (Say NO to the conclusions that follow from what they speak of ... I wasn't paying attention)

## Hayek is sometimes who is not what people think he is

Hayek was an international federalist. It is worth remembering that it was straightforward: committing to free markets means binding yourself to international positions that could bring you to international markets.

Lots of people who defend free markets is because they reward hard work and reward enterprise and it's an important point that Hayek never reasons with that: for Hayek, the market is a giant information system that gathers information and distributes it through the price system. If one were to think the job of the market to give people what they deserve that's a different conception: the market simply does what it does.

Hayek isn't a critic of the welfare state. He isn't opposed. He writes favourably in schemes that favour households that settle a minimum income. From a Hayekian point, it's got to be a welfare policy delivered through a system of rules. A welfare policy that does that is acceptable. He doesn't want a policy of discretionary power. Emphasise passage to liberalism: don't ever overstate the role of the state... the central thought is that if we leave the market to its own devices, things will go wrong.
