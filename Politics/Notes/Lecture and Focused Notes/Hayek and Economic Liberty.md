## Lecture - [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek and Economic Liberty]]

Logic of commerce and logic of war; these are not mutually exclusive e.g. Opiate Wars

Lenin - in Munich during WW1; Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism

29 September 1918: German supreme army tell the Kaiser the situation is helpless
29 October: Naval mutiny begins; start of the German Revolution
7 November: Ludwig of Bavaria abdicated; the next day, Kurt Eisner becomes Minister-President of the People’s State of Bavaria
9 November: Wilhelm II abdicates, being replaced by Ebert as Chancellor
11 November: Armistice takes effect at 11am
21 November: Hitler arrived in Munich after being discharged from hospital; Nazis a very Bavarian product

## Otto Neurath
- Vienna Circle; positivism
- With his wife, they end up in exile in Britain when fleeing from the Nazis
- System of visual representation known as isotypes; precursor to emojis - visual communication very important
- Becomes economics minister in Bavaria, trying to turn it into a communist economy
- Leaders of the revolution put on trial; Neurath escaped prison
- Max Weber gave him a character reference which allowed him to escape serious punishment
- In economics, as in every area of life, we always make value-laden incremental decisions
- The economist’s desire to make everything abstract and quantitative is deeply wrong
- We build schools simply because of a desire to learn, rather than simply because we have a certain number of ‘education units’
- *Through War Economy to Economy in Kind*
- [[Von Mises]] - responds with Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth
- [[Weber]] - responds with what he believes Neurath is getting wrong in E*conomy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology*
- ‘It is only with the greatest caution that the results and methods of war economy can be used as a basis for criticising the substantive rationality of forms of economic organisation’
- Wartime and peacetime economy simply cannot be equated
- Almost an abstract debate, concerning worldwide socialism

## Origins of Socialist Calculation Debate:

- Reasons we cannot plan an economy on socialist lines because there was not the computing power

Classical Political Economy (1776-1848)
Critique of Political Economy (Marx)
Neo-Classical Economics (late 19th century; far more mathematics based)

Austrian Tradition of Economics:
- Survives to the present; heterodox economics
- Distinctive in its huge support for the free market
- Resisted mathematisation
- Weber is plausibly an ‘Austrian economist’

Socialist Economics:
- **Taylor, Lange, Dobb and Lerner**
- Focus on efficiency

Hayek’s Contributions:
- *Collectivist Economic Planning*
- Many critical articles
- Pre-empted the publication of economic models
- Economists are not entitled to believe that their models are sound; the market is a gigantic information processing system. We go wrong when we think of it as something else.
- We cannot plan an economy:

1. Because it would be inefficient to collate necessary information

2. Literally impossible to know everything we need to know to understand a discipline as broad as economics
