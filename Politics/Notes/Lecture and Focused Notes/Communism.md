Lecture Notes

When deploying the language of sovereignty, people are creating an illusion of unity that does not really exist

Alienation - how are human beings different from animals

Especially beavers as they are:

1. Rational

2. Sociable

3. Industrious

So, what is humanityâ€™s differentiating trait?

Constant - Humans have a natural interest in the divine; beavers are secular

Marx: religion as an opiate of the masses; nothing natural about religion, we are religious because we have created a hell on earth

Humans do not build by instinct; they reflect

Equality and justice?

Not a moralising argument; communism is inevitable

## Bourgeois and Proletarians

Begins:
"The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles."

Ends:
"What the Bourgeoisie, therefore produces, above all, is its own grave diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."

## Communism I

```ad-quote
title: Marx and Enges, The German Ideology
In communist society, **where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity** but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, **without ever becomining hunter, fisherman, herdsman, or critic.**
```

There are tons of words used on Capitalism or 'capitalist mode of production' but never once brings up Communism.

Communism is envisioned as the transcendence of social of division.
This is an extremely complex manuscript to analyse. *The German Ideology* was unpublished. Who write it? Marx or Engels? Half the book was written in one, and one another. They scrawl over each other adding contracts. Some people argue that this passage is supposed to be a joke - Engels constructed an idea of a world in which we can transcend it, and Marx criticises criticising without being a critic.

One of the few things Marx said about Communism are difficult to interpret

## Communism II

```ad-quote
title: Marx, *The Critique of the Gotha Programme*
"In a higher phase of communist society,** after the enslaving subordination of the individiual to the division of labour, **and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labour, **has vanished, after kabour has become not only a means of life but life's prime want**; adter the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and **all the springs of cooperative wealth flow more abundantly**- only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be rossed in its entirety and soceity inscribe on its banners:

**From each according to his ability,**
**To each according to his needs!"**
```

Why didn't he want to outline how the society works? He just didn't. That was for the work of those working in utopian literature. Why did he have that allergy? In one of the afterword, he denounced his contemporaries as the work of revolutionaries and the work of building new social order has to be the free activity of the working class that is making revolution.

## Revolution I:

The great bulk of what he had to say about revolution belonged to the revolution of the past versus the present. From a young age, he was gripped by the French revolution and Marx was not at all uncommon in that life.

Revolution is contagious. It spreads.

Address to Communist league: criticising the line he was running in the Communist Manifesto, for class cooperation for example. Another issue is here he's writing about Bourgeoisie revolutions - part of the power held by aristocrats and emerging to behind held by the representatives of the capitalist, industrialist class.

Marx is an extraordinary writer - he writes of Louis Bonaparte.

```ad-quote
title: The Eigteenth Brumaire ofn Louis Bonaparte
"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. Caussidiere for Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the Montagne of 1848 to 1851 for the Montagne of 1793 to 1795, the nephew for the uncle. And the same caricature occurs in the circumstances of the second edition of the Eighteenth Brumaire.

Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please, they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living."
```

History gives us ideas of acting, making a point that there's something 'backwards' in looking.

Communist revolution won't be like that - social revolution will draw its poetry from the future. Not a performance from before, but we can't say something concrete about what it will be like, as if so the social revolution will be a performance of that from the past.

What lies ahead - the Bourgeoise revolutions themselves pose a bit of a problem. Marx and Marxists see the English Revolution or the French Revolution ([[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Benjamin Constant]]) are Bourgeoisie revolutions. The problem - who are the Bourgeoisie, who bear a certain type of ideology - those explanations have generally failed.

If we take a step back, we can take Marxist's fundamental claim:
"The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole Bourgeoisie."

It's obvious to understand that the British and French state are Bourgeoisie states.

Liz Truss vs Bank of England: a pro-confidence capitalist government lost the influence of the capitalists.

Greek crisis of ten years ago: left-wing government, holds a referendum to reject austerity programme. Then the government signed the austerity measures and signed the euro. The government preserves the status quo, is in the pocket of the Capitalist.

"The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole Bourgeoisie."

What does it mean to be a Jacobin? It means someone who is focused on the use of extreme violence against their enemies. Even more common was the accusation that Lenin was a 'bronkie': revolutions are not made, they come. They come from deep structural factors from modern capitalism and a revolution isn't a matter of organising a coup, an insurrection. Lenin was in the business of this.

... Was a bit sleepy ... They hated the Paris Commune. 

We also have an interesting remark on Marx whether a socialist revolution will be violent:
"We do not deny that there are countries America, England (and if I knew your institutions better, I would add Holland), where the workers can achieve revolution by peaceful means" ... But sometimes force is necessary.

"If the unavoidable evolution turns into a revolution, it would not only be the fault of the ruling classes, but also of the working classes ... If the latter has more and more weakened it is only because the English working class know not how to wield their power and use their liberties, both of which they possess legally ... In Germany, the working class were fully aware from the beginning of their movement that you cannot get rid of a military despotism but by a Revolution." (Karl Marx, Letter to Henry Hyndman, 8 December 1880, in McLeilan, KMSW, pp. 642-643),

Domestic class struggle subsidized by he super-profits of imperials, competing appeal of alternative identities, preservation of racial privilege, insufficient democratisation of political institutions, false consciousness, the culture industry ([[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimmer]]: Hollywood, pop music, television, sexual repression, working class desire for representation, persistence of large rural populations, historic function of the labour movement to rescue and restabilise capitalist relations of production.
