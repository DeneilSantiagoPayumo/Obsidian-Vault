## Lecture notes:

There is an idea of crisis in global democracy that emerges from what's happening in the United States - for example, Trump.

The Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziglatt text, and the Runciman text represent ways in which people establish their surprise.

As most texts are developing themes that the authors worked on before. The circumstances on which the argument is making makes the argument more direct.

The two books are very different and same: this is how we *used* to think about democracy, and how I held democracy to be. These are the ways in which we thought of democracy, but this is how what has changed.

Both trace their origins of their arguments to a speech given by trump seven years ago today - the inauguration speech.

Totally different texts and that's worth bringing out. The Levitsky text is taken in a catalogue of events in the third year that reflects the sustainability of democracy, uses 'we' to refer to Americans. Runciamn is detached.

Runciman uses the metaphor of democracy having a 'mid-life crisis' to explain the argument.

The dangers of democracy has changed too - if the character of democracy has changed, so has the dangers.

Democracy won't die from seizures of power like a military coup, or the military threat of non-democracies. Despite that... military coup in Africa, 2023 coup in Niger and Gabon.

It is also not an end to national elections.

Rather, the central issue is the erosion of democratic norms - focus on executive aggrandisement (Runciman), eroding norms of **mutual toleration** and **institutional forbearance** (Levitsky and Ziblatt).

"The tragic paradox of the electoral route to authoritarianism is that democracy's assassinations use the very institutions of democracy - gradually, subtly, and even legally - to kill it." (Levitsky and Ziblatt, p. 8)

Both authors see the threat as fundamental to one's way of life. That's a consequence from both author's perspectives of greater polarization of politics.

Defeated, if possible, completely. 

Nepotism of the state can be used for a variety of purposes - to crush one's opponents. What happens in healthy democracies is that each government successfully accepts that one opponent is in power.

All of this happens in normal democracies as well - trying to criticise one's opponents, trying to make them seem silly and wrong and motivated by illegitimate issues. Rather, it's threatening the peaceful transfer of power to make the process of transferring elections difficult.

This analysis of democracy is contingent on the false notion that democracy has always been behaving in a meaningful and active way.

Both see a ways in which democratic erosion has not yet completed - for both authors, this is a guard rail for democracy eroded by Trump but still in line. The ideas of losing consent is a norm of which has been challenged - willing to accept the outcome of an election and move on is not something that has been done.

Both Runciman and Levitsky start with the US context and move to comparative judgements. The central purpose, US experience, using that as a starting point for democracies around the world. They see the future of the rest of the world happening in the small towns of America. The US is not a good place to start when examining changes in democracy.

The second part of Runciman's text: whilst Levitsky sees the erosion of democracy norms spreading around the world, Runciman recognises the end of democracy in particular place.

Representative democracy in the 18th century is **not** to be replicated. We should reinvent what we think about the institutions of democracy. What are the alternatives to that model we can think of in that context?

The rise of alternative:
1. Technocracy in response to catastrophe. A challenge: who is able to make those choices? Economic crisis? Public health crisis? Something else? Environmental catastrophe? We can't decide those decisions with the technocracy. (Not lecturer, can we consider Weber)
2. The infiltration of the tech company into all aspects of our lives; the possibility of 'instant democracy' or 'epistocracy'. What he calls epistocracy: the idea that it's not people who know our best to manage political problems but its those who know how the machine works. It's those who know how tech companies work and can provide a regulatory framework for companies. For example, there was a mismatch between the institutions of representative government and the major corporations of big tech 31 January 2024, asking irrelevant questions.
3. Liberated technology - possibilities we have yet to understand.

```ad-quote
title: Phillip N. Howard, Pax TEchnica: How the Internet of Things May Set Us Free or Lock Us Up (2015), p.224 - quoted in Runciman.
"We have to fundamentally change the way we think of political units and order. Digital media have changed the way we use our social networks and allowed us to be political actors when we choose to be. We use technology to connect to one another and to share stories. The state, teh political party, the civic group, the citizen: these are all old categories from a pre-digital world ... the agency of the individual is being enhanced by the device networks in the internet of things."
