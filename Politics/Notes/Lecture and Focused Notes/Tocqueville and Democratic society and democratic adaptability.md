## Lecture notes:

Lived 1805-1859 - a French Aristocrat went to the US in the middle of the 19th century finding what he believes was the future for Europe.

## Understanding politics:
"What is meant by "republic" in the US is the slow and quiet action of **society upon itself**. It is an orderly state really founded on the enlightened will of the people."

Madison argues that the nature of our constitution is to strip power, whereas here the state is founded on the 'enlightened will'.

If it's social conditions that matter, it is social conditions not constitutions that tell us the nature of democracy. For example:
1. The local prevailed: local community was organised before the county, the county before the state, and the state before the Union
2. The inheritance of English common law
3. Abundance of land: territorial expansion
4. Protestant ethos for the first 'Anglo-American' settlers
5. Abolition of primogeniture after 1776
6. Widespread primary education and scarce higher education

Essentially, if you want to look at what American democracy is really like, you must go to a small town in Massachusetts. 

The thing that is peculiar to the US is the English common law - everyone is subject to the law and the law is built up through experiences, not imposed through the top (like France that had the legacy of Roman law).

There is an abundance of land - we've looked here in how the U.S went from the 13 states and in 1783 it has expanded all the way west to the Mississippi river - he says that the Americans have an abundance of land and this is different from the position of any other country.

There is an ethos that the settlers brought from Europe to the United States that is fundamentally Protestant - it is not Catholic. It brought a heavy emphasis on the individual, and the conscience and that made it different socially from other Catholic areas of the world.

The abolition of primogeniture - inheritance to the eldest male - is still quite important. This led an opportunity to many more people to own land where the laws of primogeniture still apply.

Finally, what goes on in education is different at this point: many people are educated at primary school level but not university level. This widespread primary education helped have a social significance - it meant that there is not much commonality of educational experience than there is in European countries.

These conditions allowed the **possibility to experiment:**

```ad-quote
title: V1, P1, C1
"In that land the great experiment was to be made, by civilized man, of the attempt to construct society upon a new basis; and it was there, for the first time, that theories hitherto unknown, or deemed impracticable, were to exhibit a spectacle for which the world had not been prepared by the history of the past."

```

It was a way of recreating political possibilities for collective life. This experiment of democracy, the great democratic revolution, was coming back to Europe.

```ad-quote
title: Introduction to V1
"A great democratic revolution is taking place in our midst ... Wherever one looks, one finds the same revolution taking place throughout the Christian world."
```

In time, Europe will be democratic in the same way the U.S is democratic. IN the world where this at least any sense of Christianity, there would be democracy.

Democracy in America equals the sovereignty of the people - "Society acts by and for itself. The people take part in the making of the law by choosing the lawgivers, and they share in their application by electing the agents of executive power; one might say they govern themselves ... the people reign over the American political world as God rules over the universe."

This is a long way from Constant about political possibility and Hobbes about sovereignty.
This is something that is getting attention in Tocqueville's argument: a complication of how far we can think about him giving an account of democracy or *American* democracy.

American isn't just a democratic republic, Europe would have democracy it would not have federalism..

The reason why the Americans can have federalism is because they don't have rival states or geopolitical opponents - "I refuse to believe that with equal force on either side, a confederated nation can long fight against a nation with centralised power."

What he suggests is that for European states, if they were to have federalism it just doesn't work.

## Democracy's weaknesses: banality

Democracy will "send the citizens to sleep in a state of happiness." At the centre of the concerns in the second volume is a concern about what democracy, if a passion for equality, will understand themselves in relations to each other. They will come and understand how individuals live their life.

```ad-quote

[Democracy risked] 'being too unalterably fixed with the same institutions, prejudices, and mores, so that mankind will stop progressing ... I fear that the mind may keep folding itself up ... without producing new ideaes, that men will wwear themselves out in trivial, lonely, futile activity, and that for all its constant agitation humanity will make no advance.'
```

Creating an emphasis on individual happiness, there will be lost of something in human greatness. And there's something else...

## Democracy's weaknesses: tyranny against the soul

A relation between the individuals and their soul - the issue of the tyranny.

This is in Madison's language - coercive power placed in human's hands. We understand what democracy is at the level of society, at where tyranny comes from in the level of society and the social. What tyrannizes us in democracy is having to live with each other, in the conditions of what we consider to be equal.

He draws a distinction in what tyranny we have in aristocracy with no equality and a clear social hierarchy, and in a democratic society. So, in the aristocratic society - "Think like me or you die." In the Democratic society, "You are free to not think like me ... but you remain a stranger among us ... if you solicit your fellow citizens' votes, they will not give them to you ... you will remain among men, but you will lose your rights to count as one ... Go in peace, I have given you your life, but it is a life worse than death."

So here for Tocqueville we've got democracy itself, the very thing that makes democracy good, also being the thing that generates the central problem for democracy - the tyranny of the majority. Conceptually, this problem hasn't been dealt with.

## To check the tyranny of the majority, democracy needs judicial aristocracy

You need a surge of aristocracy against democracy that comes from the legal side of politics - "I doubt society can rule society very long without a mixture of the legal and democratic minds."

Issues in democracy is Western countries: we get to the point that this thing that we say is the future must be checked by something, must be the law upheld by judges.

## Democracy as an ideal

Tocqueville recognised slaves and Native American were subject to tyranny.
He was pessimistic about American democracy in relation to slavery.
But he insisted that there was a transcendent Anglo-American ideal of democracy: a 'nation' united by political beliefs.

Central to the common political belief is this passion for equality.

He suggests that "Anyone ... who studies what happened in the United States will readily discover that its inhabitants... nevertheless constitute a single nation ... all have a lively faith in human perfectibility; they think that the spread of enlightenment must produce useful results and that ignorance must have a fateful effects; all think of society as a body progressing."

Human beings must progress through time. When we think and talk about democracy, this is the level that we should do.

## Contrasting with Charles Dickens

He had the opposite experience to Tocqueville! Dickens went to the US, loved it at first and then realized how much he hated it. He came as a political idealist.

Dickens is a realist - (see the book of Martin Chuzzlewit), looking at the city the day they celebrate American independence. "At the name of Freedom ... al the Sympathisers roared aloud ... for the surplus, it was agreed that it should be devoted to aiding the enforcement of those free and equal laws, which render it incalculably more criminal and dangerous to teach an African American to read and write, than to roast him alive." Shine the light, they see what you pretend to be - it is not what you are. "You're a gay flag in the distance ... you are but a sorry fustian."

Slavery is evil and Dickens abhorred it.

"I do fear that the heaviest blow ever dealt at liberty will be dealt by this country in the failure of this example."

## The force of the ideal: Tocqueville

The ideal is there, it doesn't matter how much we fall. "American's conception of a republic is singularly easy to apply and has lasting consequences ...  the theory is always good and in the end people's actions always conform to it."

The contradiction: we move to the ideal and the real.

## Four arguments from Tocqueville to consider:

1. Democracy as fate / God's work
2. Democracy as an ideal / theory versus the real
3. Democracies are better in the long term than the short term
4. Democracies progress in time

These four sections overlap with each other in some respect. We start by describing Tocqueville's language in calling democracy 'fate' or 'god's providence', the tension between the 'ideal' and the 'real'. the issue of democracy strengths and weaknesses in relation with time and tie it to what Tocqueville says about democracy as progress, and the tension between that and how the [[The Federalist papers|federalists]] saw the tension between the people and the public.

## Democracy as fate

```ad-quote
"The gradual progress of equality is something fated ... it is universal and permanent, it is daily passing beyond human control, and every event and every man helps it along."
```

It is fated - it is universal, it will and always happen. What we see in America will be extended all over the world and stay.

He argues that this is because of God's work: "This whole book has been written under the impulse of a king of religious dread ... effort to halt democracy appears as a fight against God Himself..."

In a way we can see Tocqueville influenced by this conclusion by the language of the federalist used. Through that we can see an ideal of what America as a place, and the constitutional republic came about.
## American democracy as faith in an ideal: the Declaration of Independence

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal" and if I see Thomas Jefferson I'mma tell him to put women in the sequel - work!

There were many critics that slaves would be encouraged to free themselves and become free.

What we can see by the time of Abraham Lincoln, in the middle of the American civil war, in the middle of his speech - he reaches back to the past "the unfinished work" and "our fathers brought ... liberty ... proposition that all men are created equal" but wants to make this ideal real, talking of "the great task remaining before us ... a new birth of freedom."

We can also see this with Martin Luther King: "... this note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights" ... "it is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note" ... "We've come to cash this cheque - a cheque that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice."

The ideal has such significance we must live up to it.

The same thing will happen with Obama. "The beginning of our journey ... our American journey ... lay claim to a destiny ... for a set of ideals that continue to light the world."

Obama pursued legal action to get rid of competitors in the ballot. Yet the ideal is much more important than the real.

## Tocqueville: Democracies are not good in the short term

```ad-quote
"All democratic communities are agitated by an ill-defined excitement and by a kind of feverish impatience, that engender a multitude of innovations, almost all of which are attended with expense."
```

All democratic communities are excitable, urgent, loud. This was the basis of the criticism of democracy that democratic governments spend too much since they have to buy off voters.

That said, democracies adapt over the long term. Look over decades and you'll see that democracy will succeed. They will succeed in ways that other forms of government won't. This is particularly true in relation to war.

Contrast this with [[Benjamin Constant]] who drew that distinction between the ancient war where war predominated and the modern world. In a way, Constant starting in the same place claiming that it is 'like peace' allowing people to do what they want to do. Constant's account does not allow democracy to turn to war.

Tocqueville argues that democracies will, even if they like peace, gather all of that democratic energy and pour it into war, making it more successful than non-democratic societies that encourage passivity in its citizens.

For example, we can look at WW2: France invested its entire defence in the Maginot line. Instead... the Germans went around the line. By summer of 1940 France had completely fallen. We could stop the clock and say that this blows: Britain had to retreat and France had fallen. Yet, we know that France and Britain had succeeded later. The democratic energies around Britain and France had perhaps contributed to their success: democracies are slow to war but in the end they become stronger.

## Can democracies now adapt to short or long term crisis?

1. Pandemic - was there a techno-authoritarian premium or do China's present problems vindicate Tocqueville.

There was a lot of talk in the first half of 2020. There was large protests on the street in Shanghai. Technological innovation may have provided a benefit that helped China leave the lockdown.

2. Climate change: needs short-term and long-term adaptability.

Not enough information on the near future, more decided on the long term. 

3. Energy crisis


Let's bring Tocqueville back in: the ways in which we've been talking about Tocqueville have kind of attached from material conditions. If we think about it, we would expect that ageing societies would have the most difficulties with a virus like COVID. That's obvious but not always the case - take the Spanish flu that would've hurt young people more than old people. In order to think about what kind of government is doing best when the factors facing countries are not the same.

Was Tocqueville's faith in democracy's adaptability a faith in democracy or a faith in America?
1. *The great privilege of the Americans is the ability to make repairable mistakes*
2. Was this because they were democratic citizens who are in 'a privileged position in the grand scheme of things'? (Runciman)
3. Or was this a function of geography of their republic, including its resources, that eventually provided external security and made federalism possible.

Democratic citizens can adapt to what's going on by adapting to the situations as need be. Are democratic citizens just in a privileged position in the grand scheme of things - politically, it's better to live in a democracy. In facing existential questions or the future, it's better to do this than being subjected to any form of government.

Even Tocqueville qualifies his own argument here - "the most extraordinary thing is the land that supports them." The US was advantaged by navigable rivers, minerals, fertile soil and more.

How much of this is about a form of government and how much of it is material resources?

## But this assumption was not there are the beginning of the modern republic

For Madison:
1. The American republic was an improvement and not a guarantee
2. The republic was at risk in time from changes in material and social conditions: republics were agrarian republics
3. The virtue of those who governed was always at risk

What happens in the republic for Madison depends on the quality of people's character whereas Tocqueville believed in the idea of democracy as progress. 

## Is what makes democracies work historically (very) contingent?

![[Tocqueville and Democratic society and democratic adaptability#Understanding politics]]

Can democracies function in the same way? Loads of people are entering higher education for instance.

What are the prospects for democracies under present conditions?
- All face resource depletion and the constraints of the biosphere
- Must function with significant conflicts in religious and political beliefs not underlying unity - making losers' consent hard
- Answers depend on geopolitical competition, including for the United States, not just internal questions
