[[Friedrich Hayek]]

Let's address the argument:

Hayek believes state planning was the road to serfdom as...
State planning is based on intellectual error.
Linked to his belief in liberty (negative liberty)
Link to the idea that we cannot agree on a specific belief.
Point out that the state of the economy is nigh-impossible to understand clearly.

Socialism undermines morality as it has an inadequate conception of the individualist basis of this civilisation, failing to understand the necessity for the sphere of the individual to be protected. Only if coercion is reduced, can civilisation progress through the best rules.

They must be responsible for their own welfare, their families, their own choices - if there was no freedom there would be no moral esteem.

Socialism creates dependency and undermines self-reliance.

First argument, outline his belief into the incomplete nature of central planning

His theory develops two insights: that knowledge is imperfect on human societies and that the cost of any economic activity is subjective. The character of knowledge in a market economy is dispersed, fragmented, and decentralized, and thus this allows the market to work as is intended - each agent has knowledge and resources and the market helps to coordinate this together.

For Hayek, the key problem is whether a socialist economy could provide the incentive required to allow dispersed information to be utilized in producing goods and services - only the market, competition and private property are inextricably linked. Only capitalist institutions can ensure market co-ordination will deliver an efficient economy.

Central planning is doomed to function as the knowledge to make it work could never be collected.

How does this lead to serfdom?
This is because as such: there are only two ways of coordinating a modern industrial society - administration and markets. The first involves central direction, coercion and the imposition of uniformity. Equality is achieved at the expense of liberty. The second method involves markets, individual exchange, maximum liberty and variety. There is no middle way, just fools.

He identifies socialism with central direction and liberalism with markets, making his argument binary. He never confronts the objection that a combination of methods is needed.

He aimed to show that there was no resting-place for socialists short of complete central direction of the economy and society. The utopia of democratic socialism was built around ideals of social justice, and socialists wanted to abolish private property. But if they did so, they would destroy the basis of prosperity.
The central claim of Hayek's philosophy is that knowledge is at its base at once practical and abstract - abstract inasmuch as even sensory perception gives us a model of our environment which is highly selective and picks out only certain classes of events, and is practical as most knowledge is stored in rules of action and perception.

Hayek explains in soviet-style economies of attempts to stimulate market processes in computer modelling - these models are bound to fail because they neglect the knowledge-gathering role of market pricing. Knowledge is embodied in habits and dispositions of countless men and women, dispersed throughout society. The knowledge yielded by market pricing is knowledge which all men can use, but which none of them would possess in the absence of the market process - the knowledge embodied is systemic or holistic and unknown to any elements of the system.

The rule of law must in treating citizens anonymously and be indifferent to the inequalities in men's initial endowments and material fortunes - aiming to equalize these latter would involve treating men differently and unequally and would not provide many serious inequities.

The third strand - socialism leads to totalitarianism. A central purpose of his later works was to demonstrate that political co-ordination of societies through bureaucracies was inherently inferior to economic co-ordination through markets. He wished then to minimize the role of politics and government.

The reason is because human societies go into serfdom is because of they are ignorant of the implications of thought.

What about minorities? What factor will this take place in? Way too liberal.

Disadvantages:
What about competition? Hayek never solves this problem - he argues that enterprise monopoly is a minor problem in the contemporary economy and that anti-trust and anti-monopoly policies are unnecessary as competition will constrain everything. He argues that large companies do not pose the same problems as trade unions and there's no coercion to be found.

There is a difference between creating a system in which competition will work as beneficially as possible, and one that accepts institutions as they are. We cannot argue on the principle of laissez-faire - he contradicts himself

Introduction - talk about the question, and how we're going to address the question.
Look at three examples - X,Y,Z
Conclude this

If we want to be complicated, we can do a theoretical framework - operationalization of concepts.

Two remaining examples - the first, the hardest, critical analysis - interrogating it, questioning its validity, explaining what other thinkers have said. Hobbes wrote in the 1600s, lets push different authors against each authors.


Introduction - what is meant by the road to serfdom?
What is serfdom?
What is state planning?
For this, I take this: I will outline Hayek's main arguments.

1. Introduction - my main argument:

I will bring up my three main points:
Firstly, I will outline Hayek's belief in the power of Capitalism. 
Then, I will outline Hayek's belief in totalitarianism and how this will lead to totalitarianism. 
After that, I will discuss his ideas on liberty.

I will counterbalance with criticisms: his over-eagerness for the free market that overwhelms reason.

He doesn't discuss minorities which is stupid. What if some people are inherently disadvantaged?

What if we need the power of the state to protect us?

I will conclude by arguing that it is unclear what the lines between the two are. We need the state to protect us from things we don't understand. To believe in the power of the free market is irresponsible. It is simply too irresponsible to believe that the free market is as omnipotent.
