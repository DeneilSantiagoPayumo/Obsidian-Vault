This is your first supervision, so don't worry about getting things wrong.

You'll want to write it by the end of this week.
Today, you *have* to finish reading Hobbes and David Runciman's article.
No way around it.
You want to finish this essay at around the 15th.

[[Hobbes, the Leviathan]]

How will you structure this essay?

*Why, for Hobbes, should subjects obey the sovereign?*

Is this truly right?

No, to what extent? Can this be applied to the modern society?

The points I want to bring in:

1. Outline Hobbes' theory of human nature, civil war - nasty brutish short
2. Explain Hobbes's liberal leanings
3. Explain Hobbes' belief of reason, and the geometric proof
4. Explain the role of the sovereign
5. context - civil war
6. Explain the right of institution / acquisition / authorization
8. How applicable is this today? -  [[John Dunn, The history of political theory, and other essays]]
10. What is classified as legitimate?
11. Conclusion, summing it all together - brutal theory.
