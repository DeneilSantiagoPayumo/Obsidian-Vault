This is your first supervision, so don't worry about getting things wrong.

You'll want to write it by the end of this week.
Today, you *have* to finish reading Hobbes and David Runciman's article.
No way around it.
You want to finish this essay at around the 15th.

*Why, for Hobbes, should subjects obey the sovereign?*

Is this truly right?
