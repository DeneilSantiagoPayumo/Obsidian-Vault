>This chapter explains Hobbes' idea around the Sovereign, explaining that there are no limitations on who or what sovereigns can do, and suggests these ideas are radical

This passage links to [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]]

---

The true radicalism of Hobbes's conception of Politics has two basic elements to this account: 
1. There are no meaningful limitations on who can be sovereign
2. There are no meaningful limitations on *what* sovereigns are entitled to do - sovereign power is unconstrained by rules external to the sovereign's own will.

A similar comment among Hobbes' critics is that an instance on absolute power should go along with non-discrimination of who should wield it.

Some commentators have highlighted Hobbes' insistence that the sovereign has to abide by the laws of nature: that the sovereign are subject to some sort of external constraint in the form of moral rules. Some have tried to find democracy in his writings, that Hobbes could differentiate between different holders of it. This argument however rests on the idea that Hobbes saw democracy as the default condition of politics, and everything else as a consequence of politics. To do this, we must delve into the essence of hist theory in his earlier writings like *De Cive*.

However, there is no evidence that he felt the need to modify his account - the final thing he ever wrote was his note on *Questions Relative to Hereditary Right*, giving an unequivocal restatement of the two principles that: no one can force the current sovereign to choose a successor and that the sovereign can choose anyone. 

He knew the idea of giving anyone power is difficult to accept, so thus Hobbes reminds everyone that not giving people power opens the door to chaos in the form of civil war.

His views did change over time - with a shift in what Hobbes sought to accommodate within his theory without dismissing it.

## The Elements of Law

Here, Hobbes makes it clear that sovereigns have 'duties' as well as 'rights' but he never suggests that the duties limit the rights at all - they simply follow. If you have that power, there are ways you *should* behave but your right (should you choose to disobey) will not be affected: sovereigns who act in such a way will lose their power.

Hobbes provides two ways of understanding how the idea of duty might apply to sovereigns - the first that sovereigns must obey the rule of nature (dictate peace) and may be answerable to God (and only by God so no one can use these rules to limit what sovereigns can do). Of course, Hobbes leads it up to the sovereigns to interpret what counts as divine intervention.

The fact that the sovereign remains subject to the laws of nature emphasizes the fundamental political inequality of the civil state - that the sovereign is subject to laws by 'conscience' - that they must obey these laws regardless of consent.

That said, Hobbes notes that the duty for sovereigns coincides with 'their profit' - what is good for the people is good for the sovereign. He later describes a series of areas of which it will be the advantage of the sovereign to achieve this: 'commodity of living', 'peace', 'defence against a common power.'

That said, one interesting aspect of this list is to do with promiscuity, that the sovereign must forbid copulation against nature or polygamy, ensuring the healthy reproduction of the species.

Hobbes emphasizes that the sovereign must control their subject in particular ways (and is specific about how this should be done) - ensuring that people obey the law and refrain from activities that encourage sedition.

But why sex? Hobbes concedes it when he says that:

>[!quote] Hobbes, about sex in The Elements of Law
>"A private man living under the law of natural reason only" does not break the law of nature by performing these sexual tasks.

The laws of nature is silent on these matters: Hobbes says nothing about them in his list. It is only in civil society where the improvement of a 'portion' has become the imperative that they hold.

So essentially, some rules apply to sovereigns after they have exited the state of nature ... applying because the good of collective entities sometimes trumps the goods of individuals.

This passage suggests that there are some areas in which sovereigns have strict obligations that are not directly derivable from the laws of nature but the requirements to improve civil existence.

If the sovereign is in a position to guide their own behaviour, they might not need external constraint. That said, individuals in the state of nature won't be able to turn them into guides for conduct because the condition of mutual fear that exists between individuals makes it possible to justify any sort of behaviour in the name of personal safety. All individuals in the state of  nature can agree to is that they would be better off leaving it, and thus they must abide by the convenient.

> [!tip] 
> Why would a sovereign not do their duty?

The power that the sovereign possess means that they don't need to be afraid, only just against the threat of violence from disgruntled subjects. 

Why doesn't Hobbes make the case explicitly of how sovereign right coincides with sovereign duty?

Firstly, this answer is not entirely consistent with the wider project: he does not want to imply that being reasonable is necessary as sovereigns really need a will.

Secondly, Hobbes never explicitly states that there are any good reasons to breach the laws of nature. The only problem is that people in the state of nature is free to interpret those laws as they see fit. They decide what is injustice which may create chaos. The argument that sovereigns have good reasons to obey the laws of nature does not fit with Hobbes' insistence that uncertainty is the cause of war against all as Sovereigns can decide what counts as a breach of the laws of nature. This means that the distinguishing characteristic of sovereigns is their ability to interpret the laws of nature as they see fit.

What is clear however is that Hobbes does not modify his claim about sovereignty at all: he creates a space for the dutiful sovereign but provides no means of confining a sovereign to that space: these differences are temporal. Hobbes insists that democracy is 'prior' to the other forms of government because no sovereign can be chosen except by the consent of the majority.

If you want more - the rationality, the 'right decision' - you are simply asking for far too much. Democracies can be sovereign but in practice as Hobbes suggests, democracies will turn into a form of aristocracy. 

>[!attention]
>Not to say that Hobbes cares how the Sovereign takes place, the only meaningful distinction is how many people there are in the sovereign.

Later in the book, Hobbes sets out what he calls '**the incommodities of several sorts of government compared**', implying that he does not discriminate between better or worse types of sovereign. Where he does distinguish between the different forms of sovereign power is through what can go wrong in a monarchy (avarice, nepotism, caprice) and arguing that these things are worse under an aristocracy or democracy as there is more scope with them.

There is nothing you can do about the things that might go wrong, so it is better to think in terms of the worst case scenario.

*Elements of Law* does not make the case that democracy is prior to the other forms in anything but a formal and nonnormative sensed. It makes the case that monarchy is better than the alternative because of the degree of things that can go wrong.

## De Cive

>[!quote] Hobbes, On the Duties of Those Who Exercise Sovereign Power
>When _right_ and _exercise_ are separated, the government of the commonwealth is like the ordinary government of the world, in which God the first mover of all things, produces natural effects through the order of secondary causes. But when he who has the right to reign wishes to participate himself in all judgments, consultations and public actions, it is a way of running things comparable to Godâ€™s attending directly to every thing himself, contrary to the order of nature.

This passage implies two things:
1. It is more ordinary for the right and exercise of sovereignty to be separated
2. In those circumstances the sovereign is 'God the first mover of all things' - that God is essentially non-interventionist. But the assumption is in both cases that power will not be exceeded in the normal run of things.

Richard Tuck has taken this passage to be evidence of the 'democratic side' of Hobbes' argument, highlighting a possibility of a 'sleeping sovereign' - a democratic assembly that meets rarely and delegates its powers in the interim. Hobbes says that 'the intervals between meetings of the citizens would be compared to the times when a Monarch is asleep.'

This would imply that a democracy assembly handling the administration of the state over to a nondemocratic body while retaining its sovereign right. Perhaps this is the preferable kind of democracy?

There is something to be said that Hobbes allows for this possibility but what is principly striking about this chapter is that it discusses duties only in the context of those who exercise the sovereign power. As Hobbes puts it, he is only interested in *'...who exercise sovereign power whether in their own right or by someone else's'*. Hobbes says nothing about the duties of those who exercise sovereign power *towards* those who have the right - which may confuse things.

That said, everything depends on the idea that 'the safety of the people is the supreme law' and nothing to the idea that sovereigns are answerable to their actions to their god. Ultimately, there is no distinction - if sovereign right is separated from those who exercise the power, those who have the right will resume when it will apply to them.

In *De Cive*, Hobbes goes into some detail about what sovereigns will do to maintain the public benefit: 'multitude' is dropped and 'commodity of living' is separated out into two categories, 'acquisition of wealth' and 'full enjoyment of innocent liberty' - sovereigns must not make too many laws or control too much. Where possible, subjects must use their initiative and the sovereign must decide what counts as too many.

Hobbes gives more details in *De Cive* about what is involved in securing 'defence from external enemies': first, Sovereigns must be 'forewarned' and 'forearmed'. The former requires being alert to any danger whereas the second requires having resources to meet any threat. In this passage, he uses it to mean that the sovereign responds to motion as the soul responds to light - that those who exercise sovereign power is to respond to the littlest of things and judge their significance. Sovereigns must be hyper-sensitive and also reserved: alert too to many dangers but careful not to make too many demands of their subject. 

## [[Hobbes, the Leviathan|Leviathan]]

Hobbes drops the language of duty in the chapter, "*Of the Office of the Sovereign Representative*". At certain points, the argument of this chapter is couched in terms of 'office' and 'right' - that who has the right of sovereign power holds a particular office. Whoever the right of sovereign power is required to play a role consistent with the possessions of that right. The most significant change is that sovereignty is reduced to the 'office' rather than a range of 'offices': 

The idea that sovereignty is a kind of role that must be played consistently is the shift into the Leviathan. In the prior two books, sovereigns acquire their rights by an alienation of rights whereas in the Leviathan, Hobbes makes an argument that individuals agree to be the author of the actions of sovereigns, so they will treat the sovereign's will as though it were their own. The Sovereign therein speaks for all individuals who have authorized them.

In formal terms, there is only one radical interpretation of this account: not only can anyone be a sovereign but it is possible for one to be a sovereign without knowing it. In cases of sovereignty by acquisition, this is irrelevant as being a sovereign compel people to authorize them. When it is by institution, Hobbes's account in Leviathan is formally consistent with the sovereign being ignorant of what is going on - they just need to take another's will as their own. 

Here, it depends on what individuals communicate to each other in the act of authorization - the transfer with each other, 'authority without stint'' (I will authorize that person if you will).

Putting it like this emphasizes two things: that first it does not matter who is sovereign, but that it sounds absurd when expressed like this - having to act in such a way to make the idea of his having been authorized, reminding them that his actions are their actions. He was two resources for doing this: one is the power he now to compel people to accept his actions as their actions (using his fear of power as a weapon), the other by playing his part that he must speak for them.

Hobbes's theory of representation thus opens up a venue for the sovereign to make his interpretation the interpretation of his subjects, opening a full range of idioms for conceiving of representation to describe the ways in which sovereigns may be said to speak and act for others.

In chapter XXIII entitled '*Of the Publique Ministers of the Sovereign Power*', Hobbes describes the relationship between the sovereign and those who are charged with 'the administration of the Public business' - a public minister being someone employed by the sovereign in any affairs, with authority representing in that affair.

One of Hobbes's purpose in this chapter is to distinguish those who serve the state and those who serve the sovereign in a private capacity - making a distinction between those who are given the 'general administration' and those who have 'a special administration', charges of some special business. The former are comparable to those who have the exercise of sovereign power, whereas the latter are more like special officers (their primary duty being to stay within the terms of their remit)

With this definition in mind, this becomes vastly more flexible and open-ended. Public ministers are authorized by the sovereign and thus represent the state. there are two ways in which this is understood: as a transitive relationship where the sovereign speaks for the person of the state, the ministers speak for the person of the sovereign and thus the ministers speak for the person of the state. The other way to see this is as a triangular relationship where both sovereign and minister speak for the person of the state.

The reason for preferring a transitive account is that it keeps the lines of authority clear - power come from the sovereign. However, the problem with this account is that it seems to confuse two different kinds of authority: the sovereign does not authorize their minister without stint, yet the sovereign does not authorize his or her ministers without stint even in cases where the minister has been given power to administer the whole state. It's as though sovereigns are not bound by what their ministers do in the same way that subjects are bound by what their sovereigns do. 

On the other hand, the triangular account helps separate the different forms of authorization that underpins the workings of the state.

This is a significant difference as the person who authorizes is not the person that bears responsibility for their actions - the sovereign gives the minister power to act, the minister binds the members of the state to action. 

> [!info]
> So for instance when the sovereign gives someone the power to levy taxes, the people who are bound are the subjects, who have to pay the taxes, making the sovereign effectively unbound.

Hobbes needs this structure to make it possible to act on behalf of the sovereign without limiting their own freedom of action. This is a dynamic setup as now the sovereign and their ministers can exercise power consistently. There is no suggestion either that sovereigns must be asleep, instead it is explicit that sovereigns have a double personality: the natural person whose will gives life to the state, and the public persona of the state.

## Conclusion (not to be confused with summary)

The biggest differences between the three books don't change their argument. What does change is the way Hobbes opens up the argument to allow for different ways of conceiving the role of sovereigns.

The biggest difference is that in the Leviathan the sovereign must play a part and do an element of public performance. Additionally, the language of authorization and representation leaves little room for contrasting authority. Finally, Hobbes provides a way of thinking about the divided character of the sovereign without diminishing their unified authority. 

These differences suggest an alternative route from Hobbes to modern democracy. Tuck places Hobbes in a tradition that runs through radical modern conceptions of democracy. In this account the distinction between the right and exercise of sovereignty is crucial as it is what allows people to retain their rights even when they're not involved in administration.

The only problem is that in Hobbes's version, the retention of that right is meaningless - yet without it there is no difference between monarchy and democracy since monarchs, if only exercising rights on behalf of people, can do whatever they want. This may have been his point in *De Cive*, not to argue that all states are democratic but that it makes no difference to the exercise of power in a state.

Leviathan's tradition rests on the idea that a person of the state never acts in its own right, only represented either by the sovereign power. Hobbes still wants to insist on a distinction between the sovereign power and other political representatives. No one can act for the state except on the sovereign's say-so but when they do so, they act in ways beyond merely acting for the sovereign.

The view that *De Cive* gives us of the 'democratic' Hobbes rests on the idea of democracy that sees the people as sovereign in right but having given others the exercise of the power. The Hobbesian version of this idea seems too awkward to be a plausible basis for any modern conception of democracy. *Leviathan* suggests a different possibility: if every agent of the state is able to represent the state in their own way. 

Hobbes would insist that the line between the sovereign representative and others should never be blurred, but in modern democracy we have passed that point: sovereign states have multiple different representatives who derive their power form the authority of the people. Sovereignty here is not asleep in contemporary democracies, often never there: instead we have political representatives who exercise power, sovereign states in whose name they exercise it, and democratic people who judge how they're doing.

There's no possibility of a separation of powers in his account. The sovereign representative is still the final judge. Nonetheless, Hobbes is insistent that the sovereign should face no competition but nonetheless his theory marks ways where sovereign power can open up
