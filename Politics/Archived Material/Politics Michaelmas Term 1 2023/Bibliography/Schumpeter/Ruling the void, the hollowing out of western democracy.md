## The passing of popular involvement

>[!summary]
>In this chapter I focus on the evidence of popular withdrawal and disengagement from conventional politics and discuss the emptying of the space in which citizen interaction with political representatives might be expected to be at its closest and most active.
>
>I assume that withdrawal and disengagement are symptomatic of indifference to politics ... I am concerned to emphasize the evidence of indifference on the past of both the citizenry and the political class: they are withdrawing and disengaging from one another, and it is in this sense that there is an emptying of the space in which citizens and their representatives interact.
>
>Elections and the electoral process become little more than dignified parts of the dignified part of the modern democratic constitution - elections have less practical effect because the working part of the constitution is being steadily relocated elsewhere.
>
>Firstly, the widening gap between rulers and ruled has facilitated the populist challenge of many advanced European democracies. Secondly, the withdrawal has lead to a growing significant of so-called 'non-majoritarian institutions', the growing importance of the European Union as a decision-making form and greater weight accorded to international agencies, and tendency for citizen's and politicians to seek redress through the judicial system. The modern state is assumed to be regulatory in character and limited in its capacities.

```ad-tldr
The most obvious conclusion is that it has now become more than evident that citizens are withdrawing and disengaging from the arena of conventional politics. Even when they vote ... their preferences emerge closer and closer to the moment of voting itself, and are now less easily guided by cohesive partisan cues. (45)
```

In reality, there are fewer citizens who think about politics, and fewer then for people to think in the long term. Electorates are becoming destructured, thus giving more scope to the media to play the role of the agenda-setter, requiring a greater campaign effort.

[[Anthony Giddens]] in an interview with Dutch social science magazine *Facta* drew attention to changes wrought in mass media through reality TV show. Television has become a medium in which you can participate, and now "conventional politics has become part of an external world which people view from outside." (46)

We are witnessing the transformation of party democracy into 'audience democracy' (46-47).

Both the emergence of this new form of democratic politics and encouraging voter withdrawal and disengagement feeds into one another, inevitably weakening the major actors who survive there. 'Video politics' is stronger when parties are weak and weaker when parties are strong.

"Strong parties are difficult to sustain when politics turns into a spectator sport, and that it should turn into a spectator sport is hardly surprising given the fading of real differences that divided the parties in the first place." (47)

## The challenge to party government

>[!summary]
>The conflicts that divide political parties in the older democracies of western Europe have attenuated substantially in the past thirty years, occurring at two different levels. Firstly, there is a reduction in the intensity of ideological polarization - parties that challenge the fundamental principles on which democratic regimes are founded and espouse an alternative political settlement. On the right, anti-system alternatives have been replaced by far-right parties. On the left, communist parties have transformed themselves into widely acceptable social democratic alternatives.
>
>This represents a fundamental shift from the patterns that prevailed even as late as the 1970s.
>
>While times have changed for parties trying to survive outside the mainstream, they have also changed for those inside the boundaries of conventional politics. Political scientist S.E. Finer (1975) mounted an assault on 'adversary politics' in Britain - characterized by a competitive pattern of two-party politics. There was polarization and conflict, and a policy see-saw of governments undoing the policies of the former.
>
>With New Labour's 'Third Way' being promoted as way of superseding ideology, there came what [[Burnham]] calls the 'politics of depoliticization' - a governing strategy in which decision-making authority is passed down to non-partisan bodies and in which binding rules are adopted which deny discretion to the government of the day. This centrist consensus mean that parties share the same broad commitments.
>
>In contemporary politics, in other words, it has become less and less easy for any one party or bloc of parties to monopolize power, with the result that shared government has become more common. As all parties become coalition able, more or less, coalition-making has become more promiscuous. This, together with the need for balance across separated domestic and European institutions, has inevitably led policy-making to become less partisan.

```ad-tldr
Conditions for the maintenance of party governments are becoming severely undermined. A list of reasons why follows:
```

There is one condition that remains secure - the process by which a party or parties win control of the executive as a result of competitive elections. This has always been the case in two-party systems. However, this condition is less likely to be obtained in traditional continental European systems in which fragmented party groupings compete against one another in shifting multi-party coalitions and a boundary between government and opposition have been difficult to identify.

Over time, the balance of European polities have shifted in favour of the bipolar mode. This has come about in two ways: bipolarity has become the norm in the new democracies in southern Europe. Secondly, bipolar competition is characteristic of many of the older multi-party systems - in those systems that are marked by the pronounced party fragmentation, political competition is now more likely to mimic the two-party pattern through the creation of rival pre-electoral coalitions.

Although political leaders continue to be recruited through parties, they are less likely to be recruited *through* parties. This means that the choice of leader is less determined by the strength of candidate support within the party and more often by the candidate's capacity to appeal to the media and thence to the wider electorate.

Parties are less able to offer clear policy alternative to voters - unable to identify any clear constituency within the electorate sufficiently large enough, or limited by global or European constraints, parties tend to increasingly tend to echo one another and blur clear policy choices. There is a choice between competing teams of leaders, but less choice in policy terms, suggesting that "political competition is drifting towards an opposition of form rather than of content. Competition in these circumstances can be intense and hard-fought ... but lacking in substantiative meaning." (62)

Public policy is no longer decided by the party. With the rise of the regulatory state, decisions are increasingly passed to non-partisan bodies that operate at arms length from party leaders - non-majoritarian or guardian institutions. "Faced with increasing environmental constraints and complex legislation and policy-making, there is a greater resort to delegation and depoliticization." (62) Also, the officials who work within these delegated bodies are less recruited through the party organization and increasingly held accountable by means of judicial and regulatory controls. The very notion of accountability being exercised through parties and to voters become problematic - party loses much of its representatives and purposive identity.

There is one other condition: briefly put, the left-right divide, even in its simplest form, is now finally losing coherence. Voters in contemporary Europe may be willing to locate themselves in left-right terms but the meanings associated with these distinctions are becoming diverse and confused due to policy convergence and contradictory signals.

[[Russell Hardin]] argues that two changes in the way political issues have been understood: there has been an end on the focus of economic distribution as governments are no longer capable of managing the economy with view to redistributing resources and this has settled the debate between planning and market to markets. Also, problem-solving and decision-making in public policy have become more complex and less able to control - voters can not understand the issues at stake.

## The withdrawal of the elites

>[!summary]
>Given how difficult it is becoming to engage citizens in the conventional political arena, we may expect party and political leaders to devote energy to keeping politics alive and meaningful, at least in theatrical terms. At a certain level, this has occurred - almost every European democracy has been touched by these discussions.
>
>However, there exists in the practice of organized democracy a clear tendency to match citizen withdrawal with elite withdrawal - citizens will retreat to their own spheres of interests, and political and party leaders will retreat into their own version of their sphere.


## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The golden age of party

The golden age of party has passed. The changes in the forms of party politics can be underlined under two changes: the *political identity* of parties and their *location*, and by which *re-locations*.

First, party organisations, however defined are now less well rooted within society and second, they are more strongly oriented towards government and the state. If we conceive of parties are standing somewhere between society and the state, then they have shifted along the continuum from one to another.

Electoral identification with political parties is not almost universally in decline, and attachment has eroded - levels of party membership are now markedly lower than was the case even twenty years ago.

A tendency to dissipation and fragmentation also marks the broader organizational environment within which the classic mass parties used to nest.

Party networks have also weakened as a result of a sharpening divison of labour, with the parties themselves often seeking to loosen their ties to associated groups and to downgrade the privileged access formerly accorded to affiliated organisations.

A number of key developments have marked most western democracies in the last decades of the twentieth century:
1. Parties in most democracies have moved from a position in which they were principally dependent for their survival to one where they rely on public funds. This operates in two ways: the state may classify private contributions to parties as tax-deductible but in most cases state support take the form of direct subventions for the work of parties. Direct public funding is also provided for party central offices in order to help staff and maintain organizational work between elections - sometimes couched in terms designed to depoliticize its intent. In practice, this has become means by which public resources are provided outside parliament.
2. Parties are now increasingly subject to new state laws and regulations that determine the ways in which their internal organizations may function - from having party access to public broadcasting media and more
3. Parties have also cemented their linkage to the state and to the public institutions by increasingly prioritizing their role as governing rather than representative agencies - parties have become office-speaking with winning a place in government an end in itself. There is less a sense of enduring opposition and instead temporary displacement from office.

This has had major implications for the functions that parties perform. One of the first functions of parties is to integrate and mobilize the citizenry in the polity. The second is as the articulator and aggregator of social and political interests present within the wider society, giving voice to citizens and creating packages of policies in which conflict sin popular interests can compete.

Parties are less now necessary to processes of interest representation, aggregation or intermediation. The articulation of popular interests and demands occur outside the party world, with the preferred role of parties being that of the receiver of signals that emanate from the media or wider society.

They also have a procedural role - recruiting political leaders, ensuring that parties will have a socialization of potential party leaders. Additionally, political patronage. As the number of elected offices have increases, this function may have become more important. Also, the organisation of parliament and government - in systems of parliamentary government, the necessity for parties is self-evident.

"In other words, the function that parties do perform, are seen to perform, and are expected to perform, have changed from combining representative and governing roles to relying almost exclusively on a governing role." (79)
