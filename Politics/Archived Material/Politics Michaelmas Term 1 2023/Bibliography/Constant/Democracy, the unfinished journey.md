## CHAPTER 13 - Conclusion

239 Nothing quite like in History has exerted an influence on human authority than democracy - but why? The completeness of its triumph is remarkably recent.

240 Things (politics) look very different: we are advised to consider this so. But why?

Democracy was the name of a political regime established in the Greek city-state of Athens by the aristocrat Kleisthenes.

The socio-political relations had been modified a year prior by the reforms of Solon - the only role model for the aforementioned aristocrat was his maternal grandfather.

He adopted this circumstance in the even of personal political defeat in factional struggle with his aristocrats - he took the people at large into his own faction, and to fit this regime, reorganized the social units of Athenian society.

241 Democracy was a system of self-rule. The balance of power shifted at intervals, and institutions changed immensely.

Really, it was true that the citizens of Athens ruled themselves - any citizen was likely to find themselves acting for a day as head of the official executive body of the Athenian state, the council, preparing the agenda and so on.

Every citizen of Athens was entitled to attend, vote and speak at meetings of the assembly. Every citizen who reached 30 years of age was eligible to staff one of these positions.

Athens did have political leaders - in aristocratic backgrounds and so on but in contrast to today they couldn't rely on a political party to secure their ascension.

242 In the end, they recognised the idea that election was an aristocratic method, and went to lengths to ensure that Athenian public roles emerged through random selection and lots.

What was the point? It allowed citizens of Athens to live in freedom, to live as they chose for themselves, to protect that personal opportunity against any forces.

Every citizen of Athens had a harsh and vivid contrast in mind - slavery. Very few of them had slaved, and if not, treated their wives and children as slaves.

Kleisthenes turned this political majority into an entity capable of systematic political agency - proving itself of capable of protecting its own freedom for well over a century. For Athens, the citizen of Athens constituted a single community of free men - the public political life served as guarantee for their freedom, exemplifying their individual freedom and collective solidarity.

243 Aristotle believed that the system is a repudiation of the authority of human beings - a denial of the importance of excellences. The political processes of democracy were intrinsically equivocal - the political processes of democracy were intrinsically corrupting.

Benjamin Constant believed that the freedom which ancient democracies sought was the solidarity in public agency of the citizenry as a body - having nothing to do with 'the liberty of the moderns.'

In the revolutionary metropolis of Paris, he insisted on the impossibility of creating such a same society.

For its Greek participants, ancient liberty was rewarding in what it provided and less punitive in what it took away than any attempts to revive it would prove. In the modern societies, Western Europe - the contribution of ancient democratic institutions - was not needed, and less effective.

244

What ended democracy was the military power of the kingdom of Macedon. For a century and three-quarters, the democratic citizenry of Athens proved itself capable of taking care of themselves in land and naval warfare.

245 

To understand why democracy today won, we need to separate two components which had come together - the first is the imaginative appeal and the sheer force of democracy as an idea. The second was the severely practical viability of a particular compound of economic, social and political arrangements.

246

What was new (and needed for democracy's resurgence) was its relative fragility of the system of subjugation: the same economic and social factors which made the system of subjugation fragile had created conditions in which the democratic republican rule was not vividly appealing in comparison with dynastic monarchy but was sturdily viable ... its only significant surviving cosmopolitan competitor as a theory of legitimate rule, the legacy of Russia's Bolshevik Revolution.

Today, only one model of rule exists - the modern secular constitutional representative democracy ... founded on an essentially market economy. How should we understand the nature of that state and the circumstances that brought it to this dizzy pre-eminence?

247 Well, the democracy of Athens was only made possible by the creation of the Athenian *demos* - it was preserved by their efficacy of the demos in arms and its day-to-day political life displayed the intimacy and intensity of its common commitments.

Modern states are not at all like this - it saw the political core of a given society's life as lying in a common structure of authority which incorporated all the rightful denizens of a given territory.

It is important (as seen with [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]]) to realise that the idea of the modern state was constructed for the express purpose of denying that any given population had either the capacity to act together for themselves: denying the possibility that any demos could be a genuine political agent.

For Hobbes, the imaginative legacy of the ancient world is anarchic as the legacy of an activist Christianity.

248 The idea of the modern state was invented precisely to repudiate the possible coherence of democratic claims to rule or even take genuinely political action.

It is not palpable at all that people are in fact ruling - democracy has been evidently representative rather than participatory.

But since the middle of the sixteenth century, it is the character of the state that has set terms for institutional candidates for legitimate political authority - it is its authority which is to be judged legitimate or to be denied legitimacy.

Representative democracy is democracy made safe for the modern state: democracy converted from unruly and incoherent master to docile and dependable servant.

249 Modern democracy has secured three political goods: moderate government, a system of rule that minimizes the direct risks which government power poses to the security of individual subjects and groups of subjects. As the Bill of Rights argue ... modern democracy guarantees the citizens the protection of their human rights.

It has also protected a modest measure of governmental responsibility to be governed - it is obvious when the service is crisply and arrogantly withheld - its ability to intrude into and devastate the lives of its citizens. It cannot guarantee contentment but it can guarantee a collective security against a notably disagreeable common risk - the risk of permanent subjection to a resented apparatus of rule ... the permanent basis for challenge to the existing territorial integrity of most of even the advanced states in the world.

The third is less explicit - this good makes democracy safe for a modern capitalist economy; but it also makes a modern state distinctly safer for a modern capitalist economy.

Those like Aristotle saw democracy as the direct rule of the poor over the wealthy - the political war cry of the democratic party demanded division of land and abolition of debts. This is not the case in the long run.

251 That said, it is easy to exaggerate the completeness of this reconciliation - if the modern state and standard of democratic legitimacy are compatible with the economic order.

252 Why has it protected private property? It is a mixture of appeal and viability - what has made it viable (its protection of a market economy) is not the same as what made it imaginatively appealing (resting the legitimate power of the state) in the free choices of its citizens.

If the power of the state rests on the free choices of its citizens, it is appealing enough to help consolidate its viability - an effective mechanism for securing the progress of opulence.

It has done so because of the comparative democratic credibility of the political thesis that an essentially market economy is a genuine collective good.

It would be easy to exaggerate the clarity of its political implications - it implies that there is no specifiable and categorical alternative to modern capitalism with an appeal that combines the charms of humanity and justice with the directness of personal political agency.

The recent history of social democratic governments or parties does not suggest that much will be resuscitated. History has been strongly marked by the sheer scale and pace of imaginative collapse in socialism's presumption of a privileged relation to modern social and economic life.

As the disadvantages of its opponents become blatant, the imaginative balance will tip in the other direction ... the view that socialists had the least idea how to handle an international system more benignly than our capitalist competitors is a woeful delusion.

254 The relationship between a constitutional representative democracy and capitalism is deeply untransparent - the historical services which each has rendered to the other over the last two centuries have been profound, but can't be at ease of each other.

The imaginative aim of political choice (which really is just the enforcement of public law) is the collective good of the set of human beings directly concerned.

If economics is just the product of individual decisions to buy and sell, no account of this economy can be needed to explain why any system of public decision-making can be trusted to identify the public goods required to enable it to work effectively.

255 All modern states provide physical security as they furnish for their subject - a civil police force, standing army, with their ramifying modern supplements - and choose how and when to use these instruments for the purpose. Constitutional representative democracy accepts the modern state without inhibition, offering itself as the most civilized and politically just format.

Athenian democracy ... is an improvised practical response to an immediate political problem.

256 No practical component of ancient democracy has survived intact into the war in which we now live.

What we are left with is the hope that human life may come to be more a matter of committed personal choice and less a matter of enforced compliance.

Athenian politics was extraordinarily dangerous - defeat could come at any time, meaning exile, ruin or death.
Political life was less hazardous and had a unique historical role, their acts allowing them to be the citizens with their own acts.

257 This opportunity was gone - nothing in principle can or could be done to enable modern citizens to know that or choose coherently the vast bulk of the factors that shape their lives.

Understanding the world requires a complicated understanding of the division of labour, We must see, as [[Emile Durkheim]] claimed, the state as society's brain - cognitive incapacity.

258

Constitutional representative democracies have claim to political legitimacy - the physical security, the personal liberty, a measure of real responsibility of governors to be governed and partial protection of a capitalist economy.

259 Democracy, as its core, is enduring.

Three questions then -
How do modern economies really work and what constrains their workings really place on how governments can act effectively.
How narrowly does any government have to choose been protecting the rich against the poor and contributing to improving the living conditions open to the poor.
How often and for how long do modern populations have to accept millions of misemployed and neglected for higher living standards?
How further must modern governments confine themselves to fostering the market as a pseudo-egalitarian arena? How can they produce equality.

The first question should really be answered by the modern economists.

The second question should be those of citizens of democracy.

What [[Schumpeter]] claimed, is that the demos of modern representative democracy allows themselves to choose between an organized team of candidates to govern - not morally untrustworthily. Plato pressed the idea that it reflected the rule of the unknowing over the knowing. It cannot be said that any merit of any system for co-ordinating human action is that it routinely implements the decisions of those who have no idea: Schumpeter argues that representative democracy places barriers between the two but it does little to suggest that it is well-equipped enough to meet Plato's questions.

261 To see the modern state as society's brain is to assign it the task of this too crisply. This in no way diminishes the human urgency of effective cognitive coordination and does nothing to enhance the claims of any version of democratic choice to provide such coordination.

262 The third question - how far is it sane to hope that representative democracy can ever realize for all its vastly expanded citizen-body the demanding value which Greek democrats claimed for their own far narrower demos: the goal of living in freedom for pessimism?

263 The equality of status is not a trivial. Refer back to Adam Smith, (softening of the personal dependence of society), to Socialism and so on. What must be accepted is that participation in modern economic life involves an alienation of personal control over the use of our own powers.

All we must do is defend and extend our powers.

265 The most pressing demand is that of equality between genders - no one can have a clear sense of what the relations between men and women would be like if subjugation was removed.

The challenge is disconcerting but interesting: it is not a challenge to democracy, but a challenge for democracy - it is a challenge to judge what forms of community across gender are at present responsible.

Athenian democracy began in fear. It also ended in fear. But it gave us hope.
The power of democracy is not tied to these achievements, it is less harmonious - many interpreters equate it with ideology or utopia... but it should really be both.
