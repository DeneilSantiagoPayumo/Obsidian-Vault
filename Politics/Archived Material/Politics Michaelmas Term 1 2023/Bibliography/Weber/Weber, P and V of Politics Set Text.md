The lecture which I am to give at your request will necessarily disappoint you in various ways. You are bound to expect a talk on the profession of politics to take a stand on the topical questions of the day. Yet that will only happen at the end of my lecture in a purely formal way and in response to particular questions concerning the significance of political action within our conduct of life as a whole. What must be completely excluded from today's lecture, on the other hand, are all questions concerning the brand of politics one ought to practise, which is to say the content one ought to give to one's political activity. For this has nothing to do with the general question of what the profession of politics is and what it can mean. Let us get straight down to things.


## A summary of the book:

This is Weber's lecture on politics and what qualities would be needed to be the perfect politician. From an ethic of conviction and responsibility, to an analysis of the different kinds of leadership, Weber outlines his arguments towards what the perfect politician is.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Different types of leadership (Charismatic leadership)

Weber makes a distinction between a 'professional politician' and an 'occasional politician.' For him, we are all occasional politicians when we post our ballot slips or express our will - local political agents. These people, especially in the past, used their power for the purpose of extracting profit and rent, not namely devoting their lives to the service of politics.

So what is a 'full-time' politician?
There are two ways - people either live 'for' or live 'from' politics - not an exclusive term, as people are known to do both.

Living for politics means to make it your life's cause, giving it meaning and purpose. A person living from politics seeks to make it an enduring source of income. 

"If a state or party is led by people who ... live exclusively for politics ... necessarily means that the leading political strata are recruited on a 'plutocratic' basis." (319) For Weber, this means that professional politicians are not obliged to seek recompense for their political work. Perhaps this lends to revolutionary ideas.

What kinds of inner joy does politics have to offer, or what professional qualifications does it presuppose in turning someone to a career?
Firstly, It confers a feeling of power - a sense of rising above everyday existence knowing he exercises influence on people.

"Passion in the sense of *concern for the thing itself*" (352-353) but simply to feel passion is not sufficient to make a politician until responsibility becomes the decisive lode-star of all action, requiring judgement. Weber defines judgement as "the ability to maintain one's inner composure and calm while being receptive to realities, in other words *distance* from things and people." (352)

Really, politicians must overcome a trivial enemy - *vanity*. There are ultimately two deadly sins in politics - a lack of objectivity and a lack of responsibility that leads us to committing one or other of these sins. Vanity allows the politician to thrust themselves into doing these things.

"His lack of objectivity tempts him to strive for the glittering appearance of power rather than its reality, while his irresponsibility tempts him to enjoy power for its own sake, without any substantive purpose." (354)

Weber warns of a war, when the victor will assert with self-righteousness that they won because they were in the right, or if a man suffers a breakdown he justifies his weariness by saying "it was for a bad cause". A nation will forgive damage to its interests but not injury to its honour - a matter of fact approach is needed instead.

"We have to understand that ethically oriented activity can follow two fundamentally different, irreconcilably opposed maxims. It can follow the ethic of principled conviction or the ethic of responsibility." (359).

Weber acknowledges that no ethics in the worlds can get around the fact that to acquire good ends is tied to morally suspect means. The decisive means of politics thereof is the use of violence. With this in mind, an ethic of conviction means to founder hopelessly on how the ends is to sanctify the means.

Some argue - good can only flow from good, only evil from evil. This doesn't make sense. The development of all the religions in the world rests on the opposite being true - how could an all powerful power create an irrational world of suffering?

Whoever makes a pact with force is at mercy with its consequences. Thus, you need a human apparatus - promising people inner and outwards prizes, rewards in heaven or Earth. The success of a leader is dependent on the functioning of his apparatus, dependent on its motives, not his own - the possibility of providing those prizes permanently.

Anyone wishing to be involved in politics must be conscious of these paradoxes. Else, "if the soul's salvation is pursued in a war of faith fought purely out of an ethic of conviction, it may be damaged and discredited for generations to come, because responsibility for the consequences is lacking." (366)

### Violence and legitimacy

```ad-quote
"A state is that human community which (successfully) lays claim to the *monopoly of legitimate physical violence* within a certain territory, this territory being another of the defining characteristics of the state." (312-313)
```

```ad-quote
"The modern state is an institutional association of rule which has successfully established the monopoly of physical violence as a means of rule within a territory, for which purpose it unites in the hands of its leaders the material means of operation, having expropriated all those functionaries of 'estates' who previously had command over these things in their own right, and has put itself, in the person of its highest embodiment, in their place." (317)
```

There are three grounds that legitimise any rule:
1. The authority of 'the eternal past', custom - traditional 
2. The exceptional, personal 'gift of grace' - charisma
3. Rule by virtue of 'legality' and the appropriate judicial competence founded on rationally devised rules - legal
