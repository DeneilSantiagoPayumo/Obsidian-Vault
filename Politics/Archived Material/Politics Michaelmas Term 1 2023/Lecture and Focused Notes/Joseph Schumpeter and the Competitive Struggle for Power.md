## The Modern State: monarchies, republics

[[Thomas Hobbes]] knew a lot about ancient Greek democracy, and believed that democracy was a perfectly valid form of sovereignty but that there were strong reasons to prefer monarchy.

Then, the Founders in the US created a republic, something they understood to be different from a democracy. [[Benjamin Constant]] gave a lecture on liberty when France returned to monarchical government. Constant doesn't seem to be incredibly democratic.

We examined what is on the other side of the federalist topic: Tocqueville takes us to the years after Constant dies, and we examine the American constitution of people who state themselves as creating a republic, not a democracy.

We want institutions that will give some expression to public opinion through frequent elections on the house of representatives, any number of constitutional features that will resist the democratic impulse: the senate was selected by the government of the different states. There is a powerful supreme court that could help in this regards. A powerful executive presidency. Then as now, the president would be elected by the electoral college: a fundamental undemocratic system.

Those institutions that these American founders have applied attracted the label of democracy. This is what we call the constitutional regime in America: Tocqueville certainly helped in this regard. Tocqueville is not chiefly interested in the constitutional practices, but was interested in the social character of America.

Over time, the language of democracy is increasingly used to characterize the American regime.

By the time of the 1848 revolution, the great year of European revolution, those revolutions flourished in 1848 and was shut down by the forces of reaction. God, I want to go to sleep.

Nevertheless, there is a process of ongoing democratization that underlies everything. After a civil war, the anarchic regime severely restricted the franchise. In 1832, this begins the process of broadening such a franchise. Still, there is a minority of Englishmen who had the votes.

In 1867 format, characterized as tory politics, there is now universal franchise, a mass electoral college. We have huge parties, nation-wide organizations.

That's an outline of the democratizing process in England. We can also tell stories in France.

## Two concepts of 19th-century democracy?

The committee observer observed two types of democracy: instead of having a strong and broad executive, but perhaps a Napoleonic model of charismatic authoritarian leaders.

From the perspective of the 19th century, the implication of what democracy might appear like in the future is massively different. National ideas become the vehicle for democratization. There are multi national states but they don't get to be very democratic. Democracy flourishes in homogenous communities not broader multinational regimes.

After the first world war, this is the moment that the national democratic state becomes a normal unit in European politics: most of the states in Europe aren't naturally governing the countries anymore and the national republic, the national representative democracy became a unit to do economics and shit, I don't fucking know. There's something normal about parliamentary democracy. If I'm sending these notes to someone, I apologize in advance.

National states become the vehicle for democratic politics.

What about the rise of socialism? How industrialisation is transforming society. Socialism is not becoming an individual regime, but a democratic one: Marx here constructed the communist manifesto. It speaks to a world of increasing urbanisation.

Look at that face. So punch-able. You can almost taste the smugness. What a snake.
There are so many forces in Austria. Too many.
## *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*

Marxists are right to think that socialism will replace Capitalism, the question is how. Capitalism is a system of creative destruction - entrepreneurs look for innovation, introduce new technologies, workers lose their jobs and people, they will vote for social democrats who promise social security.

As education level rises, we need more schools and universities, more intellectuals. Intellectuals whose jobs owe their creation to the success of the capitalist economy but aren't making a living from the economy becomes disaffected, spreading anti-capitalist ideas among the students.

This argument parallels Hayek. The Road to Serfdom: the democratic political engine is the transformation for road for socialism. Essentially, Socialism is more inefficient than Capitalism: less dynamism, less creative destruction, more heavily administered societies. 

Schumpeter argues that socialists have an instrumentalist attitude: they use democracy only when it suits them. But this isn't just socialism, this is for every political ideology.

He also argues, do we really align with processes as long as they're democratic? Democracy is only as good as the results that it produces.

book - capitalism, socialism and democracy

ch 21-22 [set text]

consequentialist - democracy is only as good as the outcomes it produces

- “Let us transport ourselves into a hypothetical country that, in a democratic way, practices the persecution of Christians, the burning of witches, and the slaughtering of Jews. **We should certainly not approve of these practices on the ground that they have been decided on according to the rules of democratic procedure**. But the crucial question is: would we approve of the democratic constitution that produced such results in preference to a non-democratic one that would avoid them?” (p. 217)
- For Schumpeter, **democracy is only as good as the results that it produces**

Schumpeter’s definition of democracy

- “Democracy is a political _method_, that is to say, a certain type of institutional arrangement for arriving at a political…decision and hence incapable of being an end in itself, irrespective of what decisions it will produce under given historical conditions.” (p. 217)
- the classical theory of democracy - “That institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions which realises the common good by making the people itself decide issues through the elections of individuals who are to assemble in order to carry out its will.” (p. 225)

- representative account
- does anybody really hold the classical theory of democracy? Schumpeter seems to draw on at least traditions

- Ancient Greek democracy
- Rousseau’s ‘general will’
- enlightenment ideas
- Utilitarianism

- test for right action - greatest happiness of the greatest number
- politics should be about this

## Is Schumpeter attacking Carl Schmitt?
**JanaLee** **Cherneski** has suggested that Schumpeter’s target here may be the Nazi theorist **Carl Schmitt** (see POL1, Section C), whose colleague Schumpeter briefly was at the University of Bonn.
Carl Schmitt - authoritarian, right wing lawyer, opportunistic - flips to Nazis at the time of the siege of power
- understands democracy in the way Schumpeter is critiquing
“Once one makes this connection, Schumpeter must be read as a defender of liberalism and its modern manifestation as mass party democracy, rather than as an advocate of authoritarian leadership, as is so often suggested by his critics.”

JanaLee Cherneski, “An unacknowledged adversary: Carl Schmitt, Joseph Schumpeter, and the classical doctrine of democracy”, _Critical Review_, vol. 29, no. 4 (2017), pp. 447-72.

## Schumpeter’s criticism of the ‘classical theory of democracy’

Schumpeter criticises the notion of “the common good”. There’s not really any such thing. Cf. Hobbes, etc.
- weber - modern world is a world of ethical pluralism - challenge of modern politics

Nor is there a “will of the people”. Even if a large majority votes for something, different people will have voted for different reasons.
- Hobbes didn’t like the language of the will or of free will - our passions working on us
- e.g. Brexit - people voted for different reasons, lots of arguments as to why the referendum was done incorrectly

He draws on “crowd psychology” (Gustave Le Bon) to argue that when people do things together there’s “a reduced sense of responsibility, a lower level of energy of thought and greater sensitiveness to non-logical influences” (p. 231).
- is this how voters in a democracy work?

And in a mass democracy politics doesn’t even rise to the level of a “hobby”, but is rather “the subject of irresponsible conversation”.
- most of the time people do not pay much attention to politics - only when a vote comes around and even then may not pay much attention to what/who they are voting for
- Hobbies require attention, focus, being taken seriously - politics is not like that for most people

The ordinary voter in a democracy “is a member of an unworkable committee, the committee of the wholenation, and this is why he expends less disciplined effort on mastering a political problem than he expends on a game of bridge.” (p. 234).
- lots of discourse on how voters make decisions
- people have strategies by getting a lot from a little

And one way politicians respond to this “unworkable committee” is by trying to “fashion”, “create”,or “manufacture” the will of the people (p. 235), in the manner of commercial advertising.

- politicians appeal to the will of the people as part of their sales effort
- manufactured idea by politicians - trying to sell alternative accounts of what the will of the people might
- like commercial advertising - persuading you that you want something

## **If the “classical theory of democracy” is nonsense, why does it persist?**

It persists because democracy is a kind of religious faith in the modern world, embedded in the mythological histories of our nations
- national histories are full of lies because they have to be

And it persists also because it allows politicians to shrug off responsibility for their actions, because they are carried out in the name of the people, even as they “crush…their opponents in the name of the people”, which is psychologically satisfying to them (p. 240).

- discharging the mandate
- language of democracy allows politicians to distance themselves from the responsibility of their own actions
- modern democratic politics is all about making people not responsible for their actions

- Hobbes - sovereign not responsible, people are not responsible

(Cf. Osar Wilde, _The Soul of Man under Socialism_: “High hopes were once formed of democracy, but democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.”)

## **Schumpeter’s “leadership model” of democracy**

According to Schumpeter, the right way to think about democracy is that it is **the rule of professional politicians**.

“The democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of **a competitive struggle for people’s vote**.” (p. 241)

Professional politicians are grouped together in parties, though “a party is not, as classical doctrine would have us believe, a group of men who intend to promote public welfare ‘upon some principle on which they are all agreed’… **A party is a group whose members propose to act in concert in the competitive struggle for political power**” (p. 251: cf. Weber).

The centrality of elections to the lives of professional politicians means that everything—including the merits of public policy—is considered in terms of electoral competition. Politicians try to win elections, and then they try to win re-election. (Politics, like war, is about beating your opponents.)

## **Under what circumstances is this a reasonably effective system of government?**

The professional politicians need to have energy and ability, best secured through “**the existence of a social stratum, itself a product of a severely selective process, that takes to politics as a matter of course**” (p. 258). (Schumpeter thinks that this is true of Britain, but not of Weimar Germany. Cf. Weber.)

The “**effective range of political decision should not be extended too far**” (pp. 258-9), i.e. democratic politics shouldn’t intrude on technical matters, judicial independence is a good thing, etc.

- independence of central bank
- politics needs to be self-limiting

There is “**a well-trained bureaucracy** of good standing and tradition” (p. 260).

“Democratic Self-control” (p. 261). **Participants in the system accept the rules of the political game**, i.e., to accept as legitimate laws that are passed by legislative majorities, and the authority of the executive; to leave office when defeated, and to seek to return via the electoral mechanism, etc. (Cf. Donald Trump.)

- There is a struggle going on but there is a set of rules that people abide by

## **What should we make of Schumpeter’s argument?**

Notice how this is different from earlier arguments that we’ve encountered in POL1.

Although **[[Max Weber]]’s** politicians organise in parties, compete in Parliament, divide up spoils, etc., those with a true “vocation” for politics are trying to impose their ethical vision on society, not just to win elections (and then get re-elected). (Weber might say that Schumpeterian politicians were living off politics, rather than living for politics.)

[[James Madison]] argued that representative institutions meant that those with **virtue** could aspire to govern, and that this would be a check on tyranny. Schumpeter doesn’t talk about virtue.


## **Schumpeterian “realism”**

Theories like Schumpeter’s are praised for being “realistic”: they don’t indulge in fantasies about ideal democracy, or encourage **wishful thinking** about our political condition—when we mistake our desires about how the world ought to be for how the world actually is.

But how realistic is Schumpeter’s view, as a view about real-world politics?

- Various countries have systems of Proportional Representative, in which the realities of coalition politics mean that it’s difficult for electorates to refuse to elect certain politicians to office.
- Even in classic “Westminster” two-party systems, like the UK, aspects of electoral competition don’t quite fit the Schumpeterian model: think back to the 2010 general election in particular.
- Is it really the case that all ordinary voters do is choose one set of professional politicians rather than another to rule?
