**The end of representative democracy**

What is the most plausible scenario about the death of representative democracy, and how plausible is it?

This essay will primarily run through Runciman and Levitsky's arguments. What can we learn from their books?

[[The end of representative democracy]]

[[How democracy ends]] - David Runciman
[[How democracies die]] / [[Is This Really How it Ends,]] 
[[On democratic backsliding]] - types of coups
[[Disorder, Hard Times in 21st Century]] - explores the role of finance in democracy
[[What's gone wrong with democracy]] - explains current crisis in democracy

My argument? Technology and social media.

Democracy won't end with a bang, but with a whimper. It won't be any singular event that ends democracy, but the gradual breakdown of norms related to democracy.

David Runciman: coup, catastrophe, technological takeover.

All of these can feed into each other. At the core of these ideas is the basis of 'legitimacy'. Democracies rest on the premise that its core institutional structures are considered legitimate and worthy to believe in. Current literature predominantly look at Trump - will he end the notion of representative democracy? It seems to the observer that our democratic time is full of chaos and fury: we hear about climate change, the invasion of Ukraine, political incompetence all from our phones.

Signposting: let's consider why it is that democracy won't end with a bang, but with a whimper. 

Let us discuss each of these three examples, then round off what is the most important one.

Coup - what are the dangers of coup? Bring in on Democratic Backsliding.

Catastrophe -

[[Is Global Capitalism Compatible with Democracy]]

Technological Takeover - effects of social media - surveillance capitalism, disenfranchisement with goals and jobs. Alienation? (Marxist angle here?) Social media can have an effect of not only distorting the 'truth' in political elections, but it can exacerbate echo chambers. Can we consider the role of alienation in causing the death of representative democracies? Let's consider the role of Bullshit Jobs - alienation, social anthropology.

What does Disorder, Hard Times in the 20th century tell us about representative democracy?
Instability through coup and nationhood – criteria for inclusion and exclusion, representative democracies need a political means to procure loser’s consent. Imperative for nationhood led to states’ using their own coercive capacities against their citizens.
Passage of time destabilizes all claim to nationhood – undermine the language of nationhood. What is considered the _premise_ of democracy was unable – material inequality. Did not become a full democracy – inequality was still fundamental (link with the article). David Runciman, bring him in here – catastrophe. Can a disruption in environment result in an attack in nationhood. - the Pandemic has been both a catalyst for substantial change, energy age, escape from the world of oil – fiscal stimulus.
257-258 – lack of nationhood.
Catastrophe – interconnection, all or nothing ideas. Can a catastrophe be quiet? Can disorder really truly be eased? Look into Eurozone Creditor-Debtor politics, the effects of the 2008 financial crisis could easily build up and explode into something new. A lack of consensus might exacerbate the issues of democracies. Catastrophes aren’t easily doable, and “In Britain democratically expressed discontent prevailed only to produce more instability in the UK’s multinational union.”. Street protest. Can we look at the Pandemic? Legitimacy and authority at the centre was eroded: legacy of slavery, little constitutional rights. Washington – military zone.
Interconnection, economic conflict – geopolitics may fuel economic difficulties.
Implication of difficulties with acquiring oil.
Technological advancement: deep-fake, simulacra, post-modernist conception of the world. Surveillance Capitalism might play a good role in here. Can we bring in Althusser’s conception of ideology?
Is this the death of democracy? Or simply a reality of it? Let's look at democratic politics - Alexis de Tocqueville. His idea however is a far cry from politics: politics isn't filled with equality

Structure of this essay:

Start off by outlining the themes of this question. Why are we considering the death of democracy? Bring in Trump.

Then, outline that I will argue that outline the section in three areas, and how they could attack democracy. Then I will argue that the most plausible scenario is social media. I will argue that all three areas can contribute to one another, there is not a 'distinct' cause of the death of representative democracy, but redefine the question as 'the most largest contributing factor.' I will say that a common pattern underlining is not a sudden catastrophe but in fact a decrease in its legitimacy. 

Coup: bring in Runciman, bring in Nancy, bring in inherent instabilities that may cause a coup (here, bring in Helen Thompson). 

Catastrophe: bring in Runciman again, bring in ideas of connectivity. Bring in global democracy - ideas of globalisation, interconnection that may affect the legitimacy of government. The alternative idea may be to bring in idea of climate change and catastrophe. Can this undermine democracy? Summarise with "not big enough of an impact", need something HUGE to destroy democracy. Climate change simply does not have an immediate grip on people's mind that nuclear weapons did. The only thing that climate change may attack democracy, is the death of civilisation. Is this true? Movements, commodity fetishization.

In an age of populism, while some anxious defenders of democracy are invoking the banality of evil, others are busy railing against the evil of banality. For many populists, mindless bureaucracy is not at risk of being invaded by a truly terrible idea it is powerless to resist. Instead, mindless bureaucracy is the truly terrible idea and the correct democratic response is to resist it. Both sides in populist politics – the populists and the anti-populists – believe they are fighting the good fight to save democracy from itself. The central division of our time is not democracy v. conspiracy theory. It is conspiracy theory v. conspiracy theory in the name of democracy. This is not the 1930 s all over again. It is the 1890 s, without the prospect of resolution.

Technological change: Fake news, bring in contemporary examples. Drake's nudes. Taylor Swift's deepfakes. Can Taylor Swift swing the 2024 elections? There's evidence to suggest that she has a definite impact on voter turnout. Given that young voters are pre-dominantly labour or left-wing, this may actually cause some impact. Additionally, challenge conception of truth - bring in ideas of surveillance capitalism. Bring in ideas of bullshit jobs - alienation.

What would I say is most important? Well, naturally these elements are interlinked: movements towards climate change may reinforce the premise that government institutions are not legitimate enough. At the same time, trump supporters see themselves as the last vanguard of an election. Will that showcase the impact of norms?

To be definitive, I would suggest that social media provides the strongest impact. It's impact on norms is increasing, and would only grow stronger. This is the most plausible death of democracy. There is already fear surrounding the advent of jobs created by AI, growing mechanisms. The growing masses of images makes challenging any particular version of the truth incredibly difficult. What is really going on?

Counterbalance: maybe? Maybe not? Alexis de Tocqueville - equality as an ideal. Let's look at BLM or other working class movements. At the same time, is there evidence to suggest that this forces people *into* politics, or that this disillusions people from looking at politics?

For example of the powerful effects of social media, we can look at poverty propaganda - Grenfall Tower for instance. How can the working class feel legitimate in the wake of politics if they don't even have a say? How can they vote if they're disillusioned with the stigma that is applied on them?

In conclusion, retrace.
