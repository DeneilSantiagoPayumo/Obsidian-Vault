This is a supervised review of [[The end of representative democracy]]

Ideas! (Liberal Peace Theory):
BRICs expanded - Brazil, Iran, India so on... why do they choose not to go to war despite not democracies? Is that a result of them being democratic nations?
Liberal democracy - let's push in peace. Morality is pernicious (new word!) - J.
Great powers to engage in warfare and use it as a moral standing, that is not useful theory - J.

Easier for Americans for place dictatorial nations than liberal democracy (see Arab Spring).
Combatants, not combatants - where democratic peace theory breaks down is when you talk about non-state actors. It's so abundant that the way that states conduct themselves compared to non-state actors is that there's no difference in that.

NATO charter. Rules of NATO - America gives an immense amount to NATO (2 percent), but under UN membership, 2 percent of GDP on defence. A state pays an excess of that, some not. Europe lies on the cloak of protection of the US. Some countries pay their due, some countries don't.

Citizens of the UK going down by British military, yet there are people not retained justice and should receive. Holding people accountable for war crimes - Afghanistan. When it's closer to home, a lot of it is harder. 

Ideas! (my one!):
Question implied, not very explicit.
Peter Mare: Ruling the void of American democracy.
Cartel Party thesis - governing, or at least not governing, but are all in office.
Dalai-lama governance (applicable to democracy)
Manufacture of consent.
