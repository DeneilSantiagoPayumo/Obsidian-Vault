[[The Modern State and Women]]

Main plan:

What are the challenges?

Firstly the challenge of trying to construct a theory based on Marxist or Liberal thinking.

Then, the challenge of the concept of liberal thinking - pornography.

Then, the challenge of trying to construct a version of the state divorced from those two ideals - how do they impact women? Why does it make it hard? The central project is also trying to do raise-consciousness as a tool for women, but that is also difficult within a liberal conception of equality.

How correct is this? Outline developments that does not support this, or does support it but needs to be added on - Kimberle Crenshaw. With the social construction of women, provide an example with [[Judith Butler]]

However, examine criticisms: 

Too postmodern - Drucilla Cornell
Too liberal - Denise Schaeffer

This isn't correct: bring in transnational studies, bring in judith butler.
