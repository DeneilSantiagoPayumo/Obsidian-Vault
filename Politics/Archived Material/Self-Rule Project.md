If ‘self-rule’ is impossible in the modern world, what is the price paid?

What do we define as self-rule?
One might think of a right to self determination as a self-rule - the right to decide one's institutions. One theorist who delved into this concept of self-rule is [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. What is self-rule? The ability to behave in one's capacity without the need for governance, imposition, coercion. What happens when our 'free selves' are imposed upon? Gandhi's critical insights into the nature of ideology and human behaviour - the normal features of Western (British) society that we take for granted. Anything that imposes on self-rule: education, lawyers, doctors, machinery, government pays a toll price. The most offensive mechanism is satyghara (passive resistance) and it entails a loss of cultural identity, pain and suffering. We lose our morality, our sense of self, what makes us human.

What is self-rule? What is Swaraj? What is Gandhi's ideal society? We can find Gandhi's explicit explanation of what is his society in [[Hind swaraj]].

![[Hind swaraj#^20e42a]]

In essence, for Gandhi, this means following several aspects in order to further self-rule: equality, small community - organic cohesion ([[Emile Durkheim]]). Society must not be anything more than a small community. A total removal of lawyers and doctors and government - we will take care of each other.  This society will be kind. Political realism through non-violence - see: Gandhi, the Hindus and Mahomedans.

If not, then we will be ruled by vice, inferiority, we will create our own enmity. See: Gandhi and the condition of England, Civilisation - no morality, no debate of anything, means creates ends. We create our own domination - we keep the English for their self-interest. 

We can examine the impact of railways, machinery, we can examine the impact of doctors, we can examine the impact of lawyers. In reality this creates the cycle of violence.

What does this create in total? (See: [[On the significance of Gandhi today]]  A cycle of violence, violence and nonviolent, means do not justify ends as it creates a violent world. We lose the ability to create nonviolent communities of power, cyclical, ecosocial self-reliance etc... Gandhian agnostics is about the ways in which one should govern themselves. Integration, learning and persuasion. This is the sublimination of the energy is wasted but it is still immensely wasteful, enervating, exhausting - the second is that it requires a love. This is a manifestation of a nonviolent form of life. It creates escalation - 'see [[Another realism, the politics of Gandhian non-violence]] '

This take might be presumed as idealist - can we really assume that people will get along? The idea towards self-rule is inherently linked with the idea of satyghara. Action must be taken to create a nonviolent His answer however can be understood in realist terms. If we understand the core concepts of violence and political actions, then we can understand the realist understanding of Gandhi's actions towards purging this society - to be pure, selfless, give the same right of independence and liberty.

Is this argument not idealistic?

George Orwell - is self-rule strong enough to combat totalitarian government? The Jews should've killed themselves - "it is difficult to see how Gandhi's methods could be applied in a country where opponents "

Is it applicable against one's own government? George Orwell argument.

Obviously railways, movement.

Gandhi's argument stands in complete polar opposite to those made of Hobbes and Weber. Weber - the ethic of conviction? Weber, the mass towards bureaucracy that wipes out other forms of rule.

Constant - we can't have the inner and the outer, Gandhi represents a complete dismantling of as such.

Indeed, it's hard to understand how Gandhi plans on tackling challenges in an inter-connected world. 

Emile Durkheim may argue that there is a distinction between organic and mechanical solidarity - how can we find solidarity in a shifting world.

Movement toward utilitarian calculus - however, Gandhi did illustrate some important critiques for self-rule. The independence of India is not enough - he keys this to an important effect of colonialism, the work of ideology. [[W, E. B. Du Bois]] . If the system of private profit was to be maintained, the democratic process must be limited, socialism.

Of course, what about global capitalism? Baudrillard, increasing economic inequality.

Readings of ideology, Franz Fanon (colour line), Althusser, idea that colonialism underlies ideology. The idea that India makes way for their own slavery.

To engage in self-rule, you must engage in that. The consequences for self-rule are not as dire: solidarity still exists, peaceful resolution.
