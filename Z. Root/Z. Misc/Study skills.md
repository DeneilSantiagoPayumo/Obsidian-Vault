A lot of students in pre-university (hello me!) were taught to 'say what you say' - B. O. R. I. N. G! 

Instead, for the introduction:
Why is it an interesting question, why is it not a straightforward question, what things would I need to set up, what is my argument.

BAM - and then you argue it.

Wiggly bo bo bam bam bo creativity, use funny sentences that flow cohesively and sensibly.

Let there be direction.

So what? Why is there an interesting idea? Interrogate yourself to decide the order, what you need to put first, and what is the 'so what' of putting that first.

The conclusion - do not put new info in! But, bring your material in new ways. This is the biggest so what.

So what... if it is a stupid question. Tell the examiner that the REAL question is this! But that's the subject of another essay.

You can spend time in the introduction deconstructing the question.

For *whom* would this question be relevant for.

Essentially, be fluid, creative and thought-provoking.

Read abstract, introduction or conclusion and then skim read it.

SOCIOLOGY and POLITICS means that a big evaluative mark is the expectations of the essay are for each discipline.
SAN - having read this... I (make a distinction between what you're all arguing)
POL - you have to use the passive, it can be argued that (do not use personal)

It is not the ultimate truth.

Essays in Politics & International Relations are usually answers to questions, and answers to all but the most flatly factual questions are arguments. Once you make your starting point clear, you are free to pursue whatever line you find persuasive. A good essay will indicate what is at issue in the question that it’s addressing, the important positions that have been taken on it by others, and contain a defence of the writer’s own. Some essays will be more conceptual or theoretical, some more empirical; many will be a mixture of the two. Convey what you want to say as clearly and persuasively as you can, and avoid unnecessary jargon. In particular, do not unthinkingly adopt the terms of the authors you read. For some essays, it will be these terms that are at issue: you should ask yourself whether they are the most appropriate and effective. If you believe they are not, do not be afraid to point this out, to break them apart, or to propose alternatives. It is essential to read the texts of the thinkers and analysts you are writing about. Do not be tempted by other people’s summaries. It is important also to engage with them: do not be content merely to report what the authors of primary texts or commentators have said. You will usually be asked to read authors who take different points of view. You should understand what these differences are, be able to expound and explain them, and if you can, decide between them.

Essay styles in Social Anthropology vary depending on the question asked and the approach you choose to take in answering it. Some essays will be more conceptual, or theoretical, some more ethnographic, but most will be a mixture of the two. At any event, in Social Anthropology, the answer to a question is an argument. A good essay will almost always be a defence of your own position or positions,while indicating those that have been taken by others and the range of considerations at issue. It will make clear what you think is at stake in the question, and may give your reasons for answering it in one way rather than another. It works towards a definite conclusion, even if that conclusion identifies an area of still unresolved debate. Along the way, you should seek to demonstrate a command of relevant ideas, texts, and sources: identify the kinds of arguments you are discussing and/or advancing in terms of theoretical school or style; make reference to specific authors and works; give ethnographic examples of specific peoples and places. A supervision essay is not the final word on a subject and you should feel free to argue for an unorthodox or controversial position (making clear that you know it to be so) if you think you can make a good case that it is warranted by evidence and argument. You should regard it as an exercise in the process of thinking and arguing, and as a work in progress, to be revised or extended during supervision discussion as well as in your further work. Social Anthropology has produced an essay writing guide for students writing anthropology essays for the first time. It can be found here: https://www.socanth.cam.ac.uk/raven-protected-documents/teaching-resources/ug-teaching-resources/ug-essay-writing-guide.pdf

In the first instance, this will be the books and articles the paper organiser has indicated you should read in the paper guide. Pay careful attention to the language a particular author uses and attempt to situate the work in the social and intellectual context of the period in which it was written. A good essay will provide an introduction that explains your interpretation of the question and how you intend to answer it, namely your essay’s structure and argument. As part of the process of building the argument, the body of the essay will outline, and critically evaluate, the different positions you’ve considered on the topic of the question (e.g. a question on class may discuss Marx, Weber and Durkheim’s differing understanding of the structural organisation of class, intersectional approaches to understanding class in a broader context and/or the subjective experience of class). This critical evaluation may includehow well arguments are supported with empirical examples of events(including contemporary events not yet analysed in the literature), studies or statistical data; in other words, you can use the theory to help expand our understanding of the empirical world, and then use the empirical world to help expand our understanding of the theory. You can show further knowledge by referring to material beyond the reading list, as long as you demonstrate its relevance. The essay should conclude by summarising your argument and the justifications you have offered for it, as well as indicating the relevance of your argument in the broader theoretical and/or empirical context. Always try to justify your arguments by reference to concrete examples, studies, research or new work. Reference all your sources consistently and systematically. Finally give yourself time to re-read, edit and re-edit your essay. Often the process of re-reading and editing will improve an essay immensely. This process will, of course, be aided through discussions in supervisions and the further reflections they inspire for you.

Think in sub-sections.
If I had to sub-divide it, how would I.
Arguments - what do I want to say (what are they saying), so I can have those two things coming together.
Thirdly - what questions are being raised now, I've got content, a critical analysis, register it
Useful things - keeping a voice recorder, reading itself - hides the formality of the argument.
Something you can broadly cover but not get overwhelmed.
Bring sources I have used to ground my arguments... and why.
