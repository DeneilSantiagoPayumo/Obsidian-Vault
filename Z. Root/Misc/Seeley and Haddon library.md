## Notes:

POL1 and POL2 are hand-written and invigilated exams... unfortunately.

They are complementary courses.
The difference between these two courses is that POL1 is led by political ideas whereas POL2 is an attempt that gives you historical depth and international nuance (ideas of change in the international change). 

SOC1 and SAN1 are open-book exams... fortunately!
Three set of lectures this term: *How Anthropologists Think*, *Kinship of Love and Care* and *Symbolism.*



An overview of the Cambridge libraries:
The **Seeley library** will give me *Sociology* and *POLIS* books. This library is open on the weekends.
Don't have to return anything unless they become recalled.
The **Haddon library** is older, with over 90k books there specialising in *social anthropology*. There are acoustic pods there. They lend ten books for a time for a week.

There are classes here: finding literature, reading and note making, referencing and Zotero.

Emails (if I want to contact them):
* seeley@hist.cam.ac.uk
* haddon@lib.cam.ac.uk

There will be a workshop on the 18th and 25th (of October).
