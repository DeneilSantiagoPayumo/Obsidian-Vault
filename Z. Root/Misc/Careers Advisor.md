Whether I want to do extracurriculars that do leadership roles - that is one possibility, committee position. Some societies in Cambridge are employment focused - politics society and colleges across the whole university, consulting, Wilber Force society (society run think tank - political), student journalism articles, lots of colleges have politics societies as well.

**WILBER FORCE SOCIETY NEEDS REPRESENTATION - WHAT ABOUT YOU.**

Virtual Internship - The Forage, took off during the pandemic, partner with companies, organisations to put together short internships, case studies to do. The other one is Bright network, a slightly more involved network. We'll have talks with people in work, a group project to have with people.

In terms of Summer, getting an internship or some other work experience. Helping political parties (lib, dem, campaigns) and other organisations might be interested in campaigning and interesting the government. ... They shouldn't discriminate but there are a number of things: obscure in your CV (volunteered for political party).

W4MP - (member of parliament) U.K based site where policy and politics jobs are advertised. It is not specific for students and graduates. Intern or internship. 

The Bright Network - Internship Calendar.

CHOP - Cambridge Homeless Outreach Project.

NatSen - national census, doing social research in the UK - interesting for the future.
