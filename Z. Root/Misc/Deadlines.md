Whenever you clear your subjects:
1. Due to time constraints (and a lack of need ... for now), I will skip Weber's main theory.
2. I will also skip Constant's theory because it's not important to me right now.
3. John Dunn - Liberty as a substantive political value

What books I have not read:
1. I could not find a critical introduction to Capitalism [[Social Media, a critical introduction]]
2. I have skipped John Dunn, ‘Liberty as a substantive political value’, in Interpreting political responsibility (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1996), 61-84 as my supo for it is already done
3. I have skipped Hobbes, an introduction... but I wasn't reading that anyway.
