Supervision questions:
Next week, you're going to write International Relations.
Supervision 2 POL1 will be on Hayek: why for Hayek was state planning the road to serfdom?
Or... To what extent does advanced technology transform politics?


Supervision 2 POL2 will be on Exam Q. 1. Should International Relations theories be able to explain international politics at all times and all places?

If you can, read into Constructivism early... but that will be difficult.
