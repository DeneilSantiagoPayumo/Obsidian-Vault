## Pubs and Bars
- **ADC Bar**: Housed in **Cambridge's ADC Theatre**: Very cheap and does a cocktail of the week deal, with bizarrely late opening hours (often past 1am). Popular with budding thespians.

- **The Alma**: Traditional **sports** pub near Bateman Street. Best venue to watch live sport. 

- **The Anchor, Silver Street**: Now with a **fairly expensive** restaurant on the first floor, the ground floor pub always has a good atmosphere, with a nice patio overlooking the river in summer.

- T**he Bath House**, **Benet Street**.

- **The Eagle, Benet Street**: Famous as Watson and Crick's DNA pub. Often crowded, but it's a great place to book for dinner if your family are paying!

- **The Granta**: Lovely patio view onto the river. A summertime favourite

- **The Pickerel**: Across Magdalene Bridge, nice atmosphere but **expensive**. 

- **Revolution (Revs), Downing Street**: Whilst hosting club nights (including popular Wednesday Rumboogie), the bar is also a good place for **pres** and often has good **two for one happy hour deals on weekdays**

- **The Free Press, Prospect Row**. A hidden gem a bit further away from college. 

- **La Raza, Rose Street**: Fairly **expensive** **cocktail** bar (tapas by day). Plays live music on certain nights.

- **Town and Gown**, Market Passage: Also **fairly** **expensive**, but they also have **delicious** **cocktails** and a sophisticated atmosphere. It also has a theatre upstairs which puts on some good shows, with some student shows held there too. And the bathrooms are lovely.

- **The Regal Wetherspoons, Regent Street**: Otherwise known as Spoons. It's enormous and busy, especially on weekends. **Far cheaper** than any other pub in Cambridge.
