Okay, essay plan!

What is ethnography?
First, a standard definition - the 'scientific description of people and their cultures'
Explores culture, human behaviour. Too broad question, branch out: what is anthropology for? How broad? Uncover marginalized identities, divert past the human condition and penetrate into culture. 

Perhaps implicit question is mandated here - what is ethnography *for*. To this, I borrow [[Clifford Geertz]] - ethnography is a necessity, the tool of the ethnographer to uncover identity. If anthropology is to uncover X and Y, an interpretivist approach may be necessary.

Essay:

EXPLAIN

Set out Geertz' theory of 'thick description' - what is anthropology for? How does he view culture. Describe briefly his notes on the Balinese cockfight, explore how he integrates himself into the culture and really tries to understand like them - and what conclusions he draws. Finish with the final point.

ANALYZE

Even getting integrated can't stop European influence from getting in.
Outdated term - culture? Can we really view 'culture' - Think Like An Anthropologist, bring back to the central core themes: ethnography is limited in its usefulness, link to writing culture.

Explore new kinds of ethnographies - Nightwork, Chisungu - are we overanalysing, perhaps Geertz wrote in a different time? (Respondent validation), elucidated. Do they improve upon old standards?

What elements? Reflexivity - factual account, take account of dynamics of power. Girls, women, pressure by authority (Nightwork). Male-gaze too much? Eurocentric gaze too much?

Functionalist - too ehh?

Link to study on feminine-ness. Find a way to bring in 'goth mommy.' It is absurd to assume this. Can we really escape?

Link to differences in research methods and presentation - respondent validation, interviews, way of drawing culture in.

Need to move from Chisungu to Nightwork.

But then... how do we escape our own imposition? If research imposition can't help, then what is the use of anthropology as a comparative science?

In this regard, ethnography evolves - ethnography helps to dismantle preconceptions. It will change - benefit of ethnography, changes in commentary, not a refinement of policy.

CONCLUSION

Ethnography unearths minority communities.

Read, think like an anthropologist.
