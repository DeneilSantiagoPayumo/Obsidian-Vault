He will talk about evolutionism and Functionalism.

We're not reading this because it is true .. and it is *wrong*, but almost all of anthropologies have been built on a rejection of evolution. Once we understand why we don't do that stuff anymore, we'll understand the anthropological thoughts presently.

Everything since then is a rejection of evolution.

Evolutionism is also surprisingly still with us in popular culture in how we see history - understanding the history of anthropology will help us understand the history of popular culture concept about progress and otherwise.

Thinking self-critically is very important, hence why we're learning about this!

## Evolution

Social evolutionist is broadly speaking emerged in the 19th century in the UK, US, France, and Germany and the fundamental question that we're asking is how can we explain the diversity of social arrangements around the world.

Recent anthropologists used fieldworks whereas these people use comparative surveys, they sat at home and read reports from travellers and missionaries.

They fundamentally believe that one can generalize human culture as a thing that progresses through various stages. No one would do that today. The whole research program of social evolutionism (SE) believes that culture progresses and gets better.

Every one of these stages have a characteristic social institution attached to it: that politics, family and otherwise 'looked a certain way' at a certain stage.

Different human groups passed through these stages at a different speed. In a way, you can reconstruct their history by looking through their living in 'different times.' By looking at cultural differences, you can reconstruct different cultures in time.

The idea that 'some cultures are before in time' and 'primitive' is the heart of the programme (and still is within the collective unconsciousness). Remember: there is no such thing as a **primitive** society.

So, there's a huge amount to be said about it. The lecturer skimmed it.

This is a western and European project that was steeped in a history of western visions and puzzles about the 'others', they were heirs to a long sense of roman antiquity about the self and the other. 

For example, romans used distinctions between people, an us versus them - barbarians, savages and so on.

Post-1942, a lot of western intellectuals suddenly had to deal with the emergence in their everyday knowledge of people who were not subscribed to the bible. They could not explain them by any means. So how do we fit them in the history of humanity?

For example, Montaigne viewed them as 'cannibals', Dryden - 'noble savages', Hobbes a 'state of nature'. When Hobbes describes the state of nature, he was writing at a time where people where people were comparing each other to others of a system of living where everything was a lot simpler.

In a way that clinched the rise of Anthropology was a set of shifts in the 18th and 19th century where in one hand, there was a concern around modernity where people wondered what it meant to be modern and what modern life was really all about.

The 19th century was a century of revolution, and the idea that political systems *can* be transformed, and things can be taken apart and brought together and to create progress. The rise of the social and human sciences arise in that moment where people ask how modernity distinguishes it from other periods of history.

How do other people live? 

It was also a time of empire and colonial suppression which enabled European and Americans researches to travel and gather information on people who were repressed.

The fact that Europe and America is the centre of the world is built a lot into media and thinking.

The rise of Darwinism and evolution challenged the biblical timelines and also increased debates around the rise of racial inequality, science, the critique of ideologies, and so on.

There was going to be a conversation about human differences.

One of the ways of thinking about evolution is through an old idea, taken by Adam Smith: that in his book 1776 the Wealth Of Nations, there was a division of labour, and different stages of economic and political organization:
1. Savage hunters
2. Barbarian herders
3. Civilised farmers
4. The age of commerce

We can also see where Adam Smith puts himself - he puts himself at the age of commerce, and everyone else is 'less' than him and his society. Anthropologists took this comparative programme and turned it into something scientific.

For example, you can look at their technology - what if each technological stage represents another stage in civilisation.

"By comparing the various stages ... it seems possible to judge in a rough way of an early general condition of man ... this hypothetical condition corresponds ..." to a degree of man.

This is a **mistake**.

Kuper (2005:5) says that "The whole conception of primitve society is fundamentally unsound. There is not even a sensible way in which one can specify what a primitive society is ... human societies cannot be traced back to a single point of origin. Nor is there any way of reconstituting prehistoric social forms, classifying them, and aligning them in a time series. There are no fossils of social organisations."


```ad-important
title: Distinguishing between these evolutionist and social evolutionists:
**Evolution** is random, adapting to changing conditions with no predictable stages.

Whereas, **development** is goal-directed, progressive and has predictable stages. This is the model that SE anthropologists compared other cultures to.
```

This is an assumption that the modern world is the best ideal, as though it was some universal truth.

Social evolutionist, to summarise, believed in a constant, that all humans across the world have one single kind of mind - "the psychic unity of Mankind". They believed that this mind gets more civilized through time.

### An example

```ad-example
title: Lewis Henry Morgan:
collapse: open

He was an American lawyer.
He became in providing legal help about people of land, and tenure things.

He became interested in learning about comparative law, and started a comparative program about the ways of the Iroquois

He thought that these people inherited property through their mothers, not fathers (like primogeniture).

He found that you used the same term to talk about your mother, aunt and your father, uncle.

He believed that they classified their mothers *and* sisters as the same: as the mother, a classificatory system. Whereas, in English we differentiated between them and described the relationships.

This doesn't make sense.

In Welsh there are different terms to differentiate between father, and your father's brother. In Romania, the term used to describe niece or nephew is the same as your granddaughter.

When Morgan differentiates between English and so, we realise that this is a eurocentric position as each culture classifies kinship differently.

But, he made a point that when a language make a distinction between people perhaps there's something interesting about that: are you supposed to treat father's brothers, and mother's sisters differently? Why *is* there a distinction.

He designed a questionaire and starts to spread it around everyone across the world. Wherever you meet someone, please describe your kinship terms.

He took this, collated it and then produced a story about the evolution of the family, the nuclear family, arguing that there are fifteen stages of family types: the first being of 'promiscuous intercourse', the second being 'cohabitation of brothers and sisters' then in stage 5 the 'malaysian form' and then in the 15, we get to the modern times.

Which doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
```

### Critiques

Obviously, it has links to European racial, moral superiority.
It tells a story of how other people were the 'route' to the modern era. Obviously, most of these people did not imagine other people as culturally inferior.
They were incredibly patronising to these other cultures.

Morgan tried to save these non-European lives against people who claimed that the natives were fundamentally inferior, but were fundamentally Eurocentric in this manner.

It fed a vision of colonialism as being 'aligned' with progress.

```ad-important
title: Not all of these evolutionists thought that the modern state was great:

For example, Friedrich Engels and Marx argues that there are stages of capitalism and the origin of families. Engels even goes to talk about the different stages of family, a primitive communism then to the current world. He was directly inspired by Morgan.  
```

The main start of when SE was attacked was through Anthropologists who did fieldwork of their own: Boas, for example, birthed Cultural Anthropology.

He was a German anthropologist. He was an explicit critique of scientific racism. How do cultural traits diffuse through time? He launched a strong element of American anthropologists through the concept of relativity. Boas believed that cultural traits get integrated through particular contexts.

He gives it a strong example of the notion of murder - and you try to do a comparison of how different people do murder, you've got it wrong as murder is illegal. The murder thereof of an enemy for revenge, a youth who kills his father, a father who kills his child as a sacrifice come form completely different motives and thus cannot be comparable.

### Continuing relevance.

This is a good background for understanding contemporary anthropology and where it fits.

Much of the history of anthropology has been a critique of the racist Victorian age.

It is a background for critically recognising evolutionist assumptions today. The idea that history has a direction is flawed, creating tension between the understanding of the ideas of progress and so on.

Look at people who call themselves modern - modern... to whom? 

Take a look at the (taken down) Guardian article: Can we, together, lift one village out of the Middle Ages?

Remember: the lecturer is not saying evolutionism is wrong, but to think of concepts like 'modernity' and so on critically.

Functionalism, as a school, is dead - and anthropology became a reaction to and a critique of Functionalism.

Many of its questions and answers persist, so it's important to understand critically the relationship between Functionalism and so on.

### Basics:

Malinowski set off in the early 20th century to do some fieldwork and as he was in the field, WW1 was declared and was forced to stay in one place - spending two years with the Trobriand islanders.

He wrote The Kula - involving the exchange of these rings.
For him, these shells were exchanged in a multitude of directions, and was interested in this exchange.

He wanted to understand people's religion and rituals - understand power and chieftainship: not just what it means to see from their perspective, but as how the individuals perceive this exchange.

He was one of the first ethnographic monographs - and took to understand the Kula Ring in relation to every part of their lives:
1. Each culture is a complex, functionally integrated whole
2. Attempting to "grasp the native's point of view"

### Durkheim

1. Splitting sociology from history

For Durkheim, there is a huge difference between causes and functions: separating the historical account for what it means to be the cause of a social fact, but also the function of it.

[[Radcliffe-Brown]] took a look on the Classificatory Kinship system and found the function of the system and arguing that it is a framework on how to manage relationships.


2. Splitting sociology from psychology and biology

```ad-quote
title: Splitting Sociology from psychology and biology
"The determining cause of a social fact must be sought amongst antecedent social facts and not among the states of the individual consciousness ... its function can only be social, which means that it consists in the production of socially useful effects ... the function of a social fact must always be sought in the relationship it bears to some social end."

```

Like an organism, a society:
1. Is structured and thus amenable to scientific study
2. Tends to persist in its being
3. Is more than the sum of its parts
4. Belongs to 'kinds' which can be compared

There are two different kinds of Functionalism:
Malinowksi Functionalism is focused on people's culture - perceptions, individuals - is holistic and asks about the natives point of view. This function can be social, psychological or biologica,
Structural Functionalism is focused on studying social function, social structure (not culture), comparing institutions across societies, asking about how societies remain in equilibrium

### [[Evans-Pritchard]] on Neur Fending

His first book on the Neur looks at kinship, political organisations and such.

Feuding is both a legal and a political institution - not just being violent, but it has a latent function in society.

Feuding as an institution replaces the policing, and has certain rules: there are certain people and certain targets. It's also an institution, and its role thereof that if you kill someone their family will have a duty to kill you back, it is important.

It is like arbitration - when someone kills someone else, they understand the killer is 'contaminated' with the blood of the killed, and sanctify and decontaminate them, holding them as a mediator until the new family comes about for negotiation.

This is a social system which is not random, and has meaning.

How does it act as a political institution?

Evans-Pritchard describes the kinship system of the Neur as in a lineage, another lineage to another.

A kinship experience is how people understand themselves to be related. The political system is based on groups and tribes, which are divided into primary, secondary, tertiary systems - villages with elite lineages inside them. These villages are understood not be self-contained but within a bigger network. It's far from being disorganised.

When you enter a feud, it is not the family you're feuding with, but also of the village. Along the way, if another person attacks the village of another one out, then multiple villages come out to attack the person. 

What the feud does is undergo a process of 'fission and fusion' - not unified to a single group, but doesn't completely fall apart. It keeps a society in movement without completely breaking apart.

For his argument to work, feuds can never really start. The mere fact of people feuding with each other is very, very important.

The Neur are a 'stateless society' living in 'ordered anarchy.'

## Critiques

Is society really like an organism?

But there are some things missing:
* What about history?
* What about the individuals? (Forgetting about their individual perspectives)
* Are societies bounded?
* What about power and inequality?
* What about meaning?

The final set of critiques is linked to colonialism:

Anthropology and the colonialising encounter:

```ad-quote
title: Tasal Asad (1973)
"It is not a matter of dispute that social anthropology emerged as a distinctive discipline at the beginning of the colonial era, that it became a flourishing academic profession towards its close, or that throughout this period its efforts were devoted to a description and analysis - carried out by Europeans, for a European audience - of non-European societies dominated by European power."

...

But if the role of anthropology for colonialism was relatively unimportant, the reverse proposition does not hold.
```

Colonialism shaped:
* Who got to write about whom
* Who got to be published, to have an academic career
* Whose knowledge counted as authoritative
* How societies were imagined
* What was perceived as 'normal' and 'problematic' (what needed explaining)

The fundamental point, in taking the complex politics of theory, is that the political implications are very, very complex:

"The fundamental reactionary character of functionalism is exposed since it focuses on why things do not change, rather than why they do." (Faris 1973) vs "Functionalist anthropologists ... produced representations of colonized peoples perfectly able to govern themselves." (Foks 2018)
