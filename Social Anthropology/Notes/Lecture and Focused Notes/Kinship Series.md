# Lecture notes: Kinship

Kinship is to anthropology what logic is to philosophy - it is the basic discipline 
of the subject.

Families should not be weighted with geological defined relationships - there are many different ways families characterize and address kinship: one ground rule of anthropology is that we don't consider geological relations as the only way of making relations.

## Weston

Americans "tend to imagine kinship as a discrete and private domain, [but] many ostensibly non-familial arenas are infused with heterosexist presumptions and regulated by kinship" (1991: 6)

The cultural framework that comes to configure kinship serves as a template in which people interpret the world around them. The monkey cage draws attention (see later) show how kinship ideology is absolutely naturalised. In the US, the nuclear family is a privileged construct - people tend to imagine kinship as a discrete and private domain even if these are filled with kinship assumptions. No matter how kin connections can be imagined, they hold an important place in anthropological theory.

```ad-todo
title: Kinship exercise:
How do you define kinship?
How do you sketch it out?
Do you depict it graphically or material objects?

Begin reflecting on what you think for yourself count as kinship or your kinship relations.
```

Is it a family of choice? Birth? Blood? This should remind you the ways that kinship as a concept ranges into relations of humans and non-human. Material and immaterial words capture the core of our being.

Kinship is an amorphous polythetic concept.
There is no singular definition of kinship of any group of anthropologists

Three approaches:
1. A system of categories and classifications
2. A legal means to designate rights and responsibilities
3. A practice of collective or individual behaviour

## The Marriage Law

The Delhi court coerced women into getting married. The law under which the civil court worked was the 1870s law of the Special Marriage Act of 1782. This law qualified that people could marriage across caste and religious boundaries. If a young person wanted to get married to someone their families didn't approve it, the state could witness their union.

In practice, this didn't work - the puzzle (of the lecturer's fieldwork) found that nobody really used this marriage law.

Henry Sumner Maine argues that the basis of the basis of the family in Rome were artificial, not based on blood - men held dominance over the family. There were people who were incorporated into the matriarchal household through adoption, misplaced foreigners and more. They regarded this unit as being held over by the power of the patriarchal figure.

He saw parallels between in the India of his time (1860s) and ancient Rome where this type of family still existed in India. The complex societies he argued, such as 1970s Britain, people weren't constrained by the patriarch and could exercise agency and freedom. This was his key contribution

Societies were moving from 'simple' to 'complex' family forms and that in turns mapped onto a shift from relationships based on 'status' to those based on 'contract'.

Young people were trying to find new ways of expressing their religious identities that didn't fit into different categories. He saw this as a breaking away of tradition - a show of new traditional belief. Maine was undoubtedly evolutionist but looked for relationships defined by free will to contracts. 

```ad-quote
title: Maine about evolution:
"THe movement of the progressive societies has been uniform in one respect. Through all its course, it has been distinguished by the gradual dissolution of family dependency and the growth of individual obligations in its place. The individual is steadily substituted for the Family, as the unit of which civil laws take account."

```

Thus, Maine popularised the notion that the so-called 'primitive societies' were organised on the basis of kinship whereas 'modern' ones were based on 'contract.'

## Susie McKinnon

"modern" society has happened through the enduring trope of **"the subordination and transcendence of kinship"** - has produced models of modern politics and economics that render invisible the meanings, functions and structural force of kinship in these processes. Kinship is made to de-encompass politics and economics.

## [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]

Classificatory versus descriptive kinship systems.

He argues that simple societies progressed through a series of stages from primitive promiscuity where anyone could be your father to a system based on monogamy wherein biological paternity could be certain.

Collating these terms for kinship antiquity, some societies had ways of classifying kin that had remarkable similarities.

[[Karl Marx]] read this book and annotated Morgan's book extensively. Engels even used this in his own work. Morgan has received disproportionate prominence in the world because 'that stuff went on.'

He found that the Iroquois distributed among the clans father and child so that they regarded each other as brothers - memberships of the clans was described as "having one blood" and the clan remembers to marry outside of the clan, with specific ones.

Morgan argued that the Iroquois confederacy organized all into one political family - they recognised the senator of the wolf tribe as their brother.

This introduced to anthropology an uncomfortable dialect about primitive versus modern society. Alongside these development comes Darwin's *The Origin of the Species*. 

### David Schneider:

He argued that American kinship was based on the idea of the order of nature (by blood or biology) and the order of law (by marriage or social norms).

### Kate Weston

She argues that in any relational definition, the juxtaposition of the two terms gives meanings to both - gay or chosen families cannot be understood aside form the families that gay and lesbians call biological blood or straight. She uses kinship as the principle means as of how gays in San Francisco area give meanings - non-appropriated sexual identities and non-appropriated sexual relations can claim family ties. Gay families are not a variation of American kinship, but seeks to undermine it.

# Lecture notes: Gender and Bodies

This lecture will cover kinship anthropology of the 1940's-1960's: Structural Functionalism and Structuralist Claude Levi-Strauss, the anthropology of women and the emergence of gender, and an ethnographic case: Boddy -**female circumcision in Sudan.**

## [[Radcliffe-Brown]] - Types of Descent and Kinship Systems

Anthropologists doing work on kinship saw themselves as seeing the means of which pre-industrial societies organized themselves. For them like Morgan, kinship seemed to encompass politics, religion and economics, ensuring that what was relevant to kinship was relevant for the discipline as a whole.

The presumption was that by studying kinship you could unearth the core principles of any society.

The early anthropologists left River's genealogy method - proclaiming that kinship was not related to blood and genealogy, but descent and lineage. There was two dominant methods at the time on how to study kinship: the relations between parents and children, and between marriage partners.

Radcliffe-Brown finds:
Unilineal descent - descent reckoned through a **single line** - male or female
	Patrilineal or agnatic - descent traced from an ancestor through unbroken chain of male links
	Matrilineal or uterine - descent traced from an ancestress through unbroken chain of female links

Cognatic descent - descent traced from ancestor or ancestress down through a series of links **both male or female or any combination of the two.**

The two British kinship theorists - [[Evans-Pritchard]] and more studied Radcliffe-Brown. [[Evans-Pritchard]] looked at the Nuer and argued that the lineage of the Nuer tied to its political descent - making claim to the Nuer Segmentary Lineage System.

![[mosconafig1.png]]

The argument goes that if person who represents Family I is in conflict with Family II then members of that Segment A will band together against major segment B.

This work gets picked up by [[Barth]] who makes an argument that "I against my brothers, my brothers and I against my cousins; my cousins, my brothers and I against the world."

Some of the things that Pritchard doesn't focus on is colonialisation... strangely enough.

*Skipped some...*

It's not as though people in the 40s and 50s recognised the complexity of kinship: who is doing that reproductive work, who does the work of care to ensure that babies grow into adults.

## [[Meyer Fortes]]

```ad-quote
title: Good on Fortes, 1996: 313
"Whether he is worshipping ancestors, arranging marriages, allocating work, or exerting judicial authority, a Tallensi man's rights and responsibilities are determined by his position in his partilineage. So, although lineage membership is determined by kinship criteria, its functions are economic and political."
```


## [[Claude Levi-Strauss]] - Structuralism (also Alliance Theory)

In *Elementary Structures of Kinship* he argued that marriage is what formed kinship relations. In every society, there was an incest taboo: it is the first moment of culture that defines whom you may or may not marry.

Thus, we must avoid sexual intercourse with mothers and sisters but instead to enjoin sexual intercourse and marriage outside the social group.

It is a primary act of classification that determines who we need to marriage. For Levi-Strauss this kinship is the basis of sociality: he made the claim that "War is engage gone wrong." In small scale societies we can see this vividly. Levi-Strauss argues that "Incest is socially absurd before it is morally culpable." These societies have recognised that for groups to survive we must be social and the boundaries we draw of our sociality are the boundaries that mark social relations.

What we got out of an outcome of structuralism is the analysis of society through binaries: 

Symmetric or direct exchange: women from group A marry men from group B, and women from B marry men from A.

All marriage involve first cross-cousin (cross cousins are the children of brothers and sisters.)

Generalised or indirect exchange: A's women marry B's men but B's women must marry C's men and C's women marry D's men and so on... so that group A are the "wife-givers" to Group B.

Marriage in this form generates enduring patters from one generation to the next.

## [[Gayle Rubin]]

In seeing the essence of kinship systems to lie in the exchange of women between men, Levi-Strauss constructs an implicit theory of sex oppression: places the oppression of women in social systems rather than biology.

For Rubin, the exchange of women is a deeply problematic concept. Levi-Strauss argues that this exchange is the natural difference between men and women is best and what we see instead is an oppression of natural similarities. 

Of course men and women are different from they are not "as different as day and night, earth and sky, yin and yang, life and death."

Women were prominent in anthropological account ([[Michelle Rosaldo]]) and so the problem was not that there was insufficient data about women, just that it was built on the natural basis of kinship that was constructed by men, women are which seen as a part but their contribution as to how a society functions never extended beyond the domestic context.

What we need to know then is "what kind of questions we learn to ask."

## [[Anthony Good]]

He argues that a lot of writing on kinship was written by men and damn right chauvinistic, assuming a male point of view. Men did exchange women and marriage, but what was striking was that the male vantage was replicated by presenting one point of view.

## [[Rayna Better]]

A major goal was to establish an anthropology of women - born of the feminist movement that wanted to understand why women seemed to occupy a lesser place in so many different societies.

Feminist anthropologists found themselves at loggerheads with western feminism for its disregard of the culturally varied ways in which to e a woman, or to exercise power or agency.

Look at the more famous anthropologists: [[Margaret Mead]], [[Audrey Richards]] and more.

## 1970s - 3 debates on the universal subordination of women

1. Domestic / public politics (Rosaldo, 1974))
2. Nature / Culture (Ortner, 1974)

Ortner asked if what is the subordination of women was natural to their role in child bearing, child rearing and those associated with nature, widely regarded as simple, unelaborated, pristine. Women's naturally roles were culturally elaborated the word over as such - in other words, women's association with nature was a cultural phenomenon that needed an explanation. In transforming babies who are called close to nature to adults, women were tasked with the transformation of the role of the natural child to adult, through it - associating it with a devalued natural and instead the value of cultural sphere.

3. Reproduction / production (Endholm et al 1977)

Women's reproductive roles in peasant societies were underlined, and their role in production was obscured.

Francis Pine argued that in each of these approaches, each saw the oppression of women in these social structures and culture, not biology.

Michelle Rosaldo:
"We would do well to think of biological sex, like biological race, as an excuse rather than a cause for any sexism we observe."

Last few thoughts:
Sex is seen as anatomical way - lay in the givenness of male bodies and gender was its cultural forms. In the 1960s the concept of gender is used in anthropology, the term was that it addressed male and female.

## Gender

Gender "referred to the **symbols, behaviours, roles, and statuses"** associated with sex.
[[Janice Boddy]] was doing research on circumcision in rural northern Sudan. Western feminists had strong and unyielding views. This recognised the ways that western anthropologists have negotiated their dual influences.

Her sense of shock at the meaninglessness of the custom when she first witnessed it - she arrived in June at the height of the summer when schools are closed. The rights of girls and boys were complementary - girls were circumcises to remove the clitoris to remove their reproductive organs. The action involved a local anaesthetic and infibulation - the vagina being occluded by skin, leaving a small opening of the vulva.

Boys are made to be like men - they are removed of the foreskin of the penis.

Arguably - better sexual relations? The mid-wife is made to deliver the child. What they argue is that circumcision is a symbolic act to generate virginity, taking on a social category - virgins are made not born. The process de-emphasizes a women's sexuality but looks at fertility, looking at future mothers of men.

People say between us is flesh and blood - between us there is women who are married. It is customary, necessary and enigmatically. This characterisation of heat and pain.

# Lecture notes: Love

*The lecturer forgets to put on the slide.*

Our individual theory of emotions were thought to be locked to the mind of the individual, and therefore inaccessible to anthropologists. Thus, for a long time, anthropologists were unable to study love.

"They consider love to be an epiphenomenon of anthropological research ... in other words the problem with love comes to be ideological in that it was circumscribed as an emotion and therefore unimportant to anthropologist ... it was frequently disparaged by local informants, for instance the idea that marriage was arranged by families ... this served as a basis to relegate it to the margins of anthropological inquiry."

Along this concept, the myth of romantic love as the exclusive basis of marriage for Euro Americans was accompanied by a failure to mention that arranged marriage were commonplace in 19th century England. We have this sort of skewing effect of what non-western marriage kinship is about. For example, cousin marriage was common in 19th century England, not something exotic people did. Yet, we have this polarization of narrative as euro Americans were known to have love and this effect.

Even Darwin sought to get his ally, an MP, Charles Nuvok (Nuvock) to introduce a question about close-cousin marriage in the English census in the 1870s. He believed that close cousin marriage was responsible for defects and deformities and illnesses amongst children born of offspring out of cross-cousin marriages. Yet... Darwin married his cousin. Weird.

The tendency to make marriage arrangements gifts of dowry or bride-well were reinforced by historians and anthropologists. Fischer and (Anyak?) argued that the anthropological study of romantic love due to the assumption that romantic love is only common to Western states, elites who had the time to cultivate an appreciation for subjective experiences. This is something that they believe needs to be cultivated. Underlying these views is the assumption that this is directly linked to romantic notions of love.

A scathing critique that romantic love is central to European is wrong: such exclusive (autoship) by the West appropriates love in the 70s and 60s. Phillip Aries made the notion of childhood being developed historically, and argues that the West had defined the notion of romantic love.

This leads to the thesis that love is closely associated with modernization.

This played no mean part in the characterization of non-western cultures as easily ignored or dispatched actions of western or urban elites who were so exceptional they were best ignored. Leaving aside the extraordinary implications of love songs that exist in so many cultures.

*The lecturer turns around and realises that she hasn't put on the slide.*

We've got Punjabi novels about star crossed lovers - the sort made by Waris Shah (1776) about Heer, a person belonging to a high caste and Ranja being a Jat and playing a flute. He is employed by her father to tend his buffalo and she falls in love with him.

These stories exist everywhere. In all these tales you've got sights that are venerated.

It is striking then that anthropologists make the argument that the lack of love in non-western cultures fed into racist discourse about other cultures. Hell, even the US author the declaration of Thomas Jefferson (2002 [1785]) argues "Love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation ... in general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection."

As Cole and Thomas puts it (200(9):
 "By depicting lust as omnipresent and love as absent in Africa, thereby situating blacks as morally and spiritually inadequate, these European perspectives established a set of racialised polemics that would inform subsequent discussions and representations of black intimacy."

Love is "naturalised" and is "made to appear natural, essential and immutable through its representation and reproduction in cultural systems of meaning." (Padilla et al 2007: ix).

Judith Gay (1986) published her research on "Mummies and Babies" and Friends and Lovers in Lesotho (Le-sutu).

She argued that institutionalised friendship called "mummy-baby" relationships between young girls in modern schools provided social and emotional support during adolescence.

They existed alongside heterosexual relationships.

It drew attention to the "ethnocentric polarization between homosexual and heterosexual relations" that defined western societies.

This study would provide a fresh look at affective relations among members of the same sex.

This place is land-locked and Lesotho is an independent kingdom ruled by a king. It is a poorer country than South Africa so there is a massive outflow (when the mines open) that goes to the mines from Lesotho. This outflow of main labour and poverty lead to real conditions of instability in marriages and households. Women are left with large numbers of children and women have to find their on way into the workforce, moving from rural homesteads to homes in Lesotho.

Missionary activity is happening in Lesotho that was highly disrupted.

The anthropologist notices that these initiation ceremonies for girls haven't happened for a good few decades in the area she was working: they are seen as backwards. One of the effects of those practices was to create a collective cohort of young women who would produce relationships for the rest of their life. The lack thereof means they lack a support network.

These women who were mothers would be encouraged to work and their daughters would be struggling. The solution comes be to send these kids away to boarding schools, helping those kids get taught. Here, these relationships really flourish. These 'mummy-baby relationships' come out of care, of mothering and being mothered and without the risk of childbirth and child care since pregnancies are frequent among teenage girls.

Girls describe these friendships has 'ho ratana'  (to like or love one another), lecahko (to visit), sethaka (a relationship between age mates, referred to girls who have been initiated together) and mechaufa (to fall in love or to flatter).

The accepted norms of these unions was that only one baby could have mummies although mummies can have multiple babies. These relationships were conducted through love letters that were sent and spread back and forth. It was also through sweet giving.

As one informants explain, friends may visit, love each other and give gifts: "But between mummies and babies it is like an affair, a romance, and being alone together to hug and kiss each other is always a part of it."

Mummy-baby kinship diagram: the mummy plays a protective role with their babies. These help them navigate their bonds and metrosexual (heterosexual?) relationships.

These systems challenge the polarization of homosexuality and heterosexuality, but also demonstrate how girls loved each other that was separate from relations with their boyfriends.

Let's explain love.

Love as a fulcrum in which the personal and political meet, navigating political systems. It allows us "a glimpse into the complex interconnections between cultural, economic, interpersonal and emotional realms of experience." (Padilla et al., 2007). The political economy of male migrant work in Africa causes instability in home giving us a knowledge of female intimacy that gives us an understanding of female love.

We see personhood, identity, meaning making. From gender and sexuality, communities and political entities such as nation-states.

Let's consider some theoretical ideas about love:

### Andrew Gell "On Love" (2011 [1996])

"Love is the ultimate indiscretion."

Love and knowledge for Gell are intimately connected with every society working as an "informational universe".

The forms that love takes in a given society are based on the forms of "social knowledge" in that society.

Marriages of cross-cousin are arranged when girls are very little. Romantic love doesn't happen through marriage. She argues that men are "waiting for the girls to grow up". Umeda in Sepik, New Guinea: romantic love takes the form of adultery. Affairs generated "lethal knowledge" - the disclosure of which invariably led to allegations of sorcery, leading to death.

In Modern love, modern couples need to create a narrative that transforms the arbitrariness of two people picking each other to the exclusion of so many others, these created courtship histories that serve to embed that relationship within their social world.

He speaks of the "reciprocal exchange of an escalating series of indiscretions through which the courting couple gradually create a lovers pact, not to each on each other, sexually or verbally."

The exchange of information by the couple forms the very basis of the relationship. A person chooses another because of the knowledge they have that all other potential partners were unsuitable - information is controlled and transacted so people could create their romantic selves. This information was exchanged between two persons.

It explains maiden love and love in second life, the virtual world of another anthropologist.

People choose and marriage those who are quite like themselves despite how they choose to define that. They choose to define themselves as "we were so like each other and that is why we fell in love."

In way of contrast... let's look at:

Some Muslim man who had his Hindu wife taken away from him by her family. He climbed a signal tower in protest. The lecturer wrote a book on this.

This is a powerful demonstration of love, interestingly that the law in practice was circumvented (aspects of the law that prevented bigamous marriages were used to stop love marriages). They had to publish the bans and as fast as bans were informed, they would go to their families and talk about this.

Skipping a few slides into intimacy and the economy: so what love means, how it is performed...

Padilla et Al argues that sex is prevalent outside of marriage and money more important within it than the ideology of relationships would have us think. The myth that is about commodification - that myth suggests that true relationships cannot be commodified and intimacy and commodification needs to be kept entirely separate.

Viviana Zelizer (the Purchase of Intimacy) - hostile worlds thesis, nothing but thesis TIME OUT

There was more but I didn't catch it.
