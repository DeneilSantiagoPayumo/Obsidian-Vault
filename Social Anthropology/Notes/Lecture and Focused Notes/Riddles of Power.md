## Topic one: Writing Culture

Writing cultures view Ethnographies as texts, with anthropologists as authors - they're written not in numbers but English - they're written in a language that makes anthropologists authors and have a certain kind of power: explanation and so on.

Why do you believe anthropological texts? How are they written? What do they leave out?

Anthropologists should be reflexive about the way they produce knowledge.

### The Basics

Theories aren't just self-contained schools of thought. Writing culture is a lot more complicated than that - it is up to us to see how we would define theory.

#### Writing Culture (1986) - Clifford, Rabinow, Marcus, Crapanzano, Asad...

This book was written as a reflection and critique of [[Clifford Geertz]]'s project of anthropology ... and Geertz writes a book called *Works and Lives*.

Weber - interpretation is not an objective science. You can't test it.
Geertz - "In short anthropological writings are themselves interpretations, and second and third order ones to boot ... they are thus fictions, fictions in the sense they are 'something made.'""

Anthropology is subjective, but you miss out on stuff that you can predict, that you can understand, that you can analyse.


## Michel Foucault

"Discourse" - knowledge is power.
Foucault coined the term "discourse" - to talk about the relations of knowledge and power, and sustained relations and power.

Discourse with Foucault - knowledge of a culture. They're a sort of context of knowledge that can make certain claims true or false.

In particular, he wrote about the notion of authorship - an author is someone who has authority, and writes himself. He wrote about the 'place of the author' in different kinds of knowledge and texts: there are some texts where you believe it because the author has been there.

Writing culture built on this sense that writing is about power to look at the ways anthropologists look  at this text.

Writing culture can be a critique of [[Evans-Pritchard]] and his writings of the Nuer - it combines the fiction of prose and the "scientific-ness" of an article, imbuing the text with power: "We will understand" ... "I describe" ... "My days at Muot Dit were happy." We are born into a story of anthropology but there are also moments where we believe - we are not there, we don't know the facts.

It sits in a strange place. Anthropology must deal with the oddity of constructing texts that are scientific, finding somewhere to stand on the texts that are intimately you.

We've moved so far from evolutionary things, and we might ask what's the point - but this stuff is happening at a time when other ideas of critical knowledge about text writing and power are being contested.

Writing culture were building on these ideas of the Feminist critiques.

### Feminist Critiques

For example, Feminists would argue most ethnographies were written by men *for* men. 

```ad-quote
title: Lisette Josephides critique of Sillitoe

Sillitoe: "Perhaps I can plead that the concern of this book with men is the result of this separation between the sexes made by the Wola, who rarely permit women to handle wealth except under the guidance of men..."

Lisette Josephides: "Who? Wola Men? What does "Wola" mean? Do the women agree?"
```

### Post-colonial critiques

For example, the [[Evans-Pritchard]] is an alien who took an individual exchange with a man, and took it to generalize for the entire history.

## Topic two: Ethnographies as text

So what do we do about this?
We must read critically, and write otherwise: we *have* to write reflexivity, partially, polyphony, that remarks on what they have or did not do. You admit that your knowledge is partial.

You try to write ethnography as putting the voices of the people you are working with as in the stage. You must get the people to write their visions, or make space for that.

### Crapanzano Chapter on Geertz:

He read Geertz's Balinese Cockfight:
- Use of puns
- Pronouns
- Implicit mind-reading (fusing Balinese perspective with his own)
- Generalizations about the Balinese.

"Who told Geertz? How can a whole people share a single subjectivity?"

Geertz: the culture of a people ... the anthropologist strains to read over the shoulders of those cultures.

Crapanzano: this image is striking, sharing and not sharing a text - it represents a sort of asymmetrical we - relationship with the anthropologist behind and above the native.

"The ethnographer ... marks a boundary: his ethnograpghy declares the  limits of his and his readers culture. It also attests to his ... interpretive power."

## (Topic three): Critiques

1. There is no easy escape from the authority.
2. Are we forgetting about real power - racism, whose got guns, power, money and so on. Whilst people are focusing on texts, it does not uncover *real* power relations
3. Some of this literature reproduces an excessive binarism of 'self' and 'other' - western anthropologists writing about non-western anthropologists. What about anthropologists who write about parties?
4. We are beyond claiming to represent "the natives point of view" - "anthropological knowledge is not the same as culture, knowledge, or 'voice' of the people anthropologists work with." These thoughts interfere with each other. We must keep these distinctions and make space for these people, not framing these people.


## Continuing Relevance

It's not the way we write, but what we represent.
