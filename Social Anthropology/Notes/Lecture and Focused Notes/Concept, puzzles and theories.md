## (Conceptual Tools)

These conceptual tools include evolution, culture, social structure, function, habitus, discourse and their critical history.
Anthropologists work through cases.

title: The Body of Lenin
collapse: closed

For example, there was a serious debate on what to do with the body of Lenin. The anthropologist thought it was just a body, but in fact it's more important to consider *how* the body is preserved - for instance, the body is preserved in a special way, mostly functional (able to move, the joints are able to operate) however none of the content of the body is the same and has been replaced. That said, they kept the 'form' of the body such as his eyebrows. They set up a special laboratory and have 24 other laboraties to test chemicals on, as though they designed a scientific discipline for this special significant case.

Perhaps the problem the Body of Lenin faces was through its historical prospect: when Socialism's first leader died, there was debate on what to do with his body. As thus, they borrowed directly from saints, keeping the form of the body but not the substance. It has a direct parallel to Marxism - they kept the form of Lenin's theory, but they removed most the substance.

From this case, we can understand multiple key concepts about 'big puzzles' - around stability, embodiment, symbolic practices.

This is a key example of anthropology, doing small case studies and connecting them to the bigger picture.

The way that puzzles are framed changes through time. This is the core of what these lectures are about.

Firstly:
1. It is considered history, not progress.
2. Secondly, we must learn to recognise models.
3. Third, we cannot apply the models too rigidly.

What does this mean in practice?
Old theories of Social Anthropology are still used. It is a misconception to assume theories are built upon over and over to become 'better', then it is dead wrong.
We will study bodies of theories instead.

We can view them through [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s theory of 'paradigms', a shift from one paradigm to the next. Neither is wrong and there's validity in both theories.

From where are they making this argument, from another perspective? This is core evaluation. For example, if we look at a Functionalist take we can ask to what degree are they looking at inequality.

These models are a great frame: what counts as an argument, what counts as a proper frame, what are good questions to ask. There's no anthropologists that can answer the question 'how can society grow?' as we understand that society grows in multiple ways, so that means that this question *was* a good question but not good for us now.

```ad-example
title: An example as to how models are often implicit
collapse: closed
Models can have implications that we need to delve deep.
This is a picture of a magazine of a scan of a brain saint:
A picture of a scan has implications and assumptions that brains are the same, that brains have only have one stem or that there is a 'normal' brain.
This is an example of **how** even the most obvious of takes have assumptions and takes.

## Part 2: Two ways with Culture

Structuralism takes the view of the all-knowing anthropologists.
Interpretivism takes the study of a culture on a personal level - seeing what these symbols mean to people.

## Part 3: The Riddles of Power

Practice theory - building on these ideas of knowledge and power, building in materiality and the body: how power is in things and physicality and how we call our bodies.
