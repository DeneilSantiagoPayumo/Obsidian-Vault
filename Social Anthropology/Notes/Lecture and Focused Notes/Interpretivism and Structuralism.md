## Structuralism

Structuralism - 1950s-1970s.
It emerged in France, then UK and also has an effect on US anthropology.
It was a reaction to and critiques of Functionalism.
It is interested in conceptual / mental structures
Culture is like language, having grammar, implicit rules and so on.

We're thinking of structure as having grammar, the logical patterns that underline a system.

Functionalists and Evolutionists believed that anthropology was a science, but Structuralism viewed it as a *different* kind of structure: the thought that language and culture and minds and computers and they operate in ways that are quite similar.
We might have a general science of how systems operate.

These guys believed that we should study culture in that linguistic scientific way.

title: Applying linguistic rules to Christmas dinner.
collapse: closed
What are the simularities between Sarmale and Roast dinner? Why are they both considered Christmas dinner?

Well, they are things that can be subdivided amongst many people, take a lot of labour.
There are may separate elements that enable it for changing.
They're extra rich - having loads of stuffing.

Do they fit these patterns?

It's not just about what they have in common, but also what they *don't.*
For instance, what's the difference between this and everyday food?
Well, everyday food is quick, is simple and has individual portions.
```

The core structuralist insight:
Basic structural patterns underlie messy cultural particulars.

## Examples of Structuralists

There are many, many theorists - but mainly associated with [[Claude Levi-Strauss]].

He was born in Belgium, studied in Paris, enrolled in military service in France, escaped France and then became a professor of Anthropology.

## Basic structure of Structuralism

#### There is an underlying structure of language: 'langue' versus 'parole.'

Take, the professor's speech, parole - incoherent speech, not structurally sound so on and so forth.
Langue - use the basic structure of the English language that makes it follow that we all ascribe to.

These rules don't have to be consciously known. We don't have to study grammar to understand it - we can recognise that it isn't right. Between the messy stuff that we speak, there is an expectation of language.

#### Arbitrary relation between signifier and signified:

Meaning comes from relations to other signs, not relation to the world.
You don't understand the meaning of a word to the object, it's purely because we agree that there are a set of meanings in our language that we learn from.

Imagine learning language from a dictionary - if you wanted to learn the word mammal, you'd have to understand it in relation to other words like: animal, vertebra, cat, fur, bear, whale, water, fish, a connection of words and their meanings.

A mug is a mug because it is not a mug. A glass is a glass because it is not a plate. A plate is a plate because it is not a bowl. Different languages make different distinctions between objects, and this is interesting to Structuralist: a language is a system of arbitrary signs attached together.

#### Phoneme Theory

Language is truly a system of arbitrary oppositions between noises (vowels, consonants) and that corresponds to a system of ideas.

For example, in France, what is the difference between cul and cou - they pronounce very, very similar: so each language is a selection of noises that are put in a system to distinguish things. The noise are assigned arbitrarily, assigned randomly to things, to make the world.

So for civilizations, Structuralist theories are important: we take colours and assign them to a socially meaningful system of signs, the relationship between the colours and these meanings are arbitrary.

Functionalism (UK) has two kinds:
Malinowskian functionalism - function is used loosely, interest in individuals and culture
Structural-functionalism is interested in social structures.

Structuralism (FR)
They are interested in symbolic structures.
```

```ad-example
title: Totemism
collapse: open
19th century Evolutionists were interested in Totemism: when a society is divided into groups, there is a special relation between each group and one or more classes of objects that are usually natural species of animals and plants.

They would say, where does this fit in the grand theory of culture?

Functionalists wanted to see why people chose these particular animals - they argued that these animals represented a society that they chosen. [[Radcliffe-Brown]] thought they had an important practical function - an object or event that has important effects tends to become an object of the ritual attitude, reminding themselves what animals need to be protected, be wary of and so on. [[The Division of Labour in Society|Durkheim]] would point to the social function of religious life that these totems display.

A Functionalist approach grouped animals and wanted to understand why these animals were chosen.

A Structuralist would say that it is not the animal that matters, but relationships between the set of groups and animals - animals are a language for talking about society. People use the world around them to talk about social differences. It isn't certainly about totems, but a broader way in which people use things about the world to think: Functionalists think people have total animals because they are "good to eat" but rather they have animals because they're "good to think".

The broader point>: Totemism is a subset of more general phenomenon. 

The science of the concrete is the use of a concrete phenomenom to talk about another abstract realm, a widespread aspect of human thought ... these devices prove suitbale for such operations because the devices themselves ... can easily be structured and therefore processed efficiently by the human mind or brain.

Another important was this: it is niether the mind of savages nor that of primitive or archaic humanity, but rather mind in its untamed state as distinct from mind cultivated or domesticated for the purpose of yielding a return.

Everyone everywhere is a poet, a scribe, so on - they live lives that have complex and artistic lives.

 If you take a look at British meals, you tend to realise that as time goes it can be quantified: A plus 2B.
> There's a grammar and logic, people recognise that something is *feeling* like a festive or special meal.
> This stuff is compatible with Feminist theory. Why do we assume certain things should look or do certain things? They aren't just about soup or food, but the ways people discover things and organize their lives.
```

## Criticisms

```ad-example
title: Cakes:
Wedding cakes - Charlsey's Wedding Cakes and Cultural History
> There is an association between the colour of the cake and the colour or shape of the dress.
> Wedding cakes get cut and the couple stabs the cake.
> It's not far to argue that what is going on here is a sort of ... sex? I don't understand...?
> This is treating cakes at one moment, but if you look in the past you can see royal icing being tough.
> But! Before this, there was a tradition where you cut a small portion of the cake and push it through the ring.
```

Structuralist don't ask *why* or *what* people think of these things. They treat objects as an object at one point of time, missing its history, potential power and what people think they're doing.

This seems arbitrary - an extraction of polar patterns at the whim of individual structuralist virtuosos (Gellner). But the structuralist *is* treating their data with respect, and is trying to see patterns.

## Relevance

Continuing appeal beneath its core points - order beneath messy reality, with unconscious models structuring our perception and action.
There are very powerful 'mid-level' theoretical analysis.
This can be combined with other theoretical schools - Functionalism and Marxism / Feminism.

Culture is patterned by grammar we are not aware of.

## Interpretivism

This is a theory made in the 60s/70s.
It views culture like texts, or an assemblage of texts - and seeks to interpret these texts. Culture is not a hidden grammar underlying what we are doing, it is a shared set of meanings: it is what we are doing, how we try to make sense of the world, and so on.

```ad-important
title: Culture:
collapse: closed

They are like scripts, written, a giant library, and Interpretivists seek to uncover a giant understanding about the world.

All of the people we've spoken to views anthropology as a social science. Instead, Interpretivists believe anthropology is an interpretative science. Anthropology is literally like history, an interpretative approach.
```

### Clifford Geertz (1926-2006)

He is an anthropologist who wrote *a lot* - the Religion of Java, on Islam and so on.
He also read, most interestingly, 'Thick Description' and 'Notes on the Balinese cockfighting.'
It is known as a culture theory - how cultural aspects shifts people's personalities.

He combines this vision of culture (Diffusionism) with another element of thought - Hermeneutics, Interpretivism like Weber.

This idea that anthropology is a form of interpretation, an idea that comes as far as Weber and William Dilthey - creating 'Verstehen' (empathetic understanding), and a distinction between hermeneutics versus positivism.

```ad-example
title: It's raining here...
Action is movement that is meaningful, an analysis into the subjective actions of people. Why are people not coming to the lecture today? Is it because of the rain? Why is the rain making people less inclined?
```

This came with a notion from British philosopher Gilbert Byle - **Thick Description**.

Thin description - describing an action from the outside. If you attempt to interpret this story, you might try to analyse things.

```ad-example
title: Winking!

A lady is winking in a photo.
A **thin description** is describing that she is merely winking.
A **thick description** tries to understand why.
```

When people do things, they do it in layers of complexity. What does it mean for different people in different actions?

```ad-quote
title: Weber...
"The concept of culture I espouse ... is essentially a semiotic one. Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of siginifance he himself has spun. I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to therefore not an experimental science in search of law, but na interpretive one in search of meaning."

...

"Doing ethnography is like trying to read ... a manuscript - foreign, faded, full of elipses, incoherences. suspicious emendations, and tendentions commentaries, but written not in conventionalized graphs of sound but in transient examples of shaped behaviours."
```

### The Balinese Cockfight

The article starts with a story - one of the things we see is that anthropology is written into a picture of a particular way.

His story: he arrived, everybody ignored him for ages.
Eventually, they were walking around and he joined in watching a cockfight.
Cockfighting is illegal and the police arrive.
They huddle into someone's random kitchen, and they covered for them.
The point of this story is to trust his perspective: someone who's been there, been in their shoes, and then describes aspects of cockfighting.

Cockfighting is symbolic - in Balinese culture, there are lots of jokes about 'cocks', sexual innuendos and puns: people constantly joke about men and their cocks. The reader, as us, can laugh.

But there's an understanding about animality in Bali - animals are considered negative, being animal-like is negative and there's a lot of understanding in how children are raised to not behave like animals.

He then gets to the mechanics of the fights itself: the fights are violent, quick, fast, messy but organized - lots of discussions about the fairness of a fight, the strength of an animal, its weaknesses and so on.

```ad-quote
title: The cockfight:
"This crosswise doubleness of an event which, taken as a fact of nature, is rage untrammeled and taken as a fact of culture, is form perfected, defines teh cockfight as a sociological entity."
```

People bet on these cockfights - there are side bets between audience members, big bets between fighters.

The stakes amongst villages are high, and what is at stake is not about making money, but what is really important is status and drama. This is a 'deep play' (from Jeremy Bentham) where the stakes are so high that gambling is 'irrational.'

It is a social organisation, betting with kin / friends / allies, against enemies.

*"Cockfights make nothing happen."*

You don't change in status
There is no redistribution of money
No psychological function

It seems odd to us and has no real function.

"It's function, if you want to call it that, is interpretive; it is a Balinese reading of Balinese experience, a story they tell themselves about themselves."

It's a function - 'a means of expression; its function is neither to assuage social passions nor to heighten them [...] but in a medium of feathers, blood, crowds and money to display them."

Culture is "an ensemble of texts ... which the anthropologists strain to read over the shoulders of those to whom they properly belong."

So really, the Balinese cockfight does two different things:
* It illustrates **cultural differences** 
* It demonstrates **cultural intelligibility** 

The starting point is cultural relativism, and understanding a culture, before making a moral argument.

```ad-quote
title: Interpretivism versus functionalism
"Culture is not a power, something to which social events, behaviours, institutions, or processes can be casually attributed: it is a context, soemthing within which they can be intelligibly - that is thickly - described."
```

```ad-quote
title: Interpretivism versus structuralism
- "Culture is public because meaning is"
- Culture is messy: "Nothing has done more, I think, to discredit cultural analysis than the construction of impeccable depictions of formal order in whose actual existence no one can actually believe."
- Different 'levels' of explanation: culture as langauge (structuralism), cultures as texts (interpretivism).
```


## Critiques and problems:
Visions of culture - power and tensions, different perspectives
Culture isn't totality: who among the Balinese?
Different perspectives aren't elucidated upon.

```ad-seealso
title: Keesing 1987
"Vies of cultures as collective phenomena, of symbols and meanings as public and shared, need to be qualified by a view of knowledge as distributed and controlled. Even in classless societies, who knows what becomes a serious issue. Cultures as texts, I will argue, are differently read, differently construed, by men and women, young and old, experts and nonexpert, even in the least complex societies ... we need to ask who creates and defines cultural meanings, and to what end.

...

Where feminists and Marxists find oppression, symbolists find meaning."

```

What about relationships between culture - are we overanalysing cultures, or introducing stuff from our culture to theirs.


## Continuing relevance

This vision of culture is the biggest 'export' of anthropology: to history, literary studies, and popular culture.

Cultural interpretation remains pervasive in anthropology.

Interpretivism can be combined with an attention to power, historical change, individual agency.

More generally, as Engelke notes:
- Anthropologists have long since been aware of the complexity of culture: Malinowski views 'human cultural reality is not a consistent logical scheme but a seething mixture of conflicting principles.'
- This complex notion of 'culture' remains useful counterpoint to:
1. Those who give it no role at all (biological determinists, psychologists who generalize society...)
2. Those who treat cultures as essential units (political commentary, some versions of IR theory...)
