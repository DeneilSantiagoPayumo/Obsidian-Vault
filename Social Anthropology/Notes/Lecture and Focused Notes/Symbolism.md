## Houses and Time

Kurowai people:

There's no calendar, no years, no seasonality that meant that the years are a salient unit.

The length of time a house takes to be occupied - a house falling down takes a year or two. People build a house, live in it, eventually it deteriorates.

You must ask them in the series of houses they live in.
Their memory and their own life was marked across by these houses.
It's a memory palace - a time and series of time about where these houses are.

To sum up: people's sense of time are heavily spatialized. 

Look at the ceilings of the houses - the bones of animals. Why do that? They say, it is to see the goodness and prosperity. The ceiling of the house. We can see how long people live there, things people have bee eating over their months and years.

We know what symbolism is and how it is discussed in our everyday lives.

A symbol is, as we understand it, something that stands for something else. A statue of Edward Colsten stands for something that lives in the past: it created who we are, it represents a lot. Taking the statue down and dismantling it. The smiling emoticon stands for happiness.

A signifier - a symbol *means* something and has a meaning. People's lives consist of elaborate networks of symbolic connections. They're ghostly and we constantly live in a ghost world.

The presence of temporality is more subtle and multi-layered than what it is in a dictionary.

The history of meals and social relations are the same thing: the house, and the ceiling, is symbolic of family and the quality of life people are living there. Another level of what houses are socially are is socially: houses have a women's territory and a man's territory. We have two halves of this house.#

It's a mark of 'you don't belong here' and yet you are here. There are no phones so guests are interesting and surprising. People get really quiet and there's no - hey, great to see you! - because that would be rude. Instead, the house owners start preparing food for them. What you do when people enter the house is also signifying meaning about belonging and not belonging and so on.

There are many homes in different places. They have their places of belong. This flows across the physical existence of these houses. Houses signify social relations.

Let's move to abstract things referring to these descriptive things: two points.
1. Things in our life symbolize social relations and that theme has been incredibly important in SAN work about symbolism. Valuable works here include *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1912)*.

A short version of the argument in this book:
- Durkheim's question - what is religion - becomes the meaning of what do people find in totems? Totems symbolize the importance of clan groups. Encountering and meeting your clan groups origin animal, emblem, colours and people actually view is the power of the social collective, not the power of the animal, emblem or colour.
- Society needs symbols - we need collective representations to hold society together and make people know that they're 'in' society. Symbols make that a pretty hard thing. It's why people being together in one place, coordinating their activities around each other that people have direct experience of this abstract social collectivises. They find that experience energizing and pleasurable.

Clothing and everything and anything tattooed on our bodies - they're obviously personal and subjective. They have feelings and desires and ownness.

Durkheim's theory is blunt - it is circular, supposed to answer everything, builds its answers into its assumptions. Not all symbols symbolize society. There is no account for actual form of symbols - why do they take this specific form? What about the social meanings people attribute to these symbols? What is any given social relation?

2. The other part, all people don't feel that there's a difference between the signifier and the signified. Instead, we live our lives tacitly or semi-consciously: a photo of a person you have unconditional love towards. You can't cut out their eyes without it feeling wrong. You say 'shit', the sound is more than the sound alone - the sound and knowledge that the speaker is crude and vulgar. From his accent, some people believe that the lecturer is from the US. Those vowels are physical sounds, but people believe that these stereotypes of American words, they make the present something else that is not present in them. Same thing for Kurowai houses, these houses do not symbolize their houses in a symbolized, ordered way: they are very real and they're very much in the house. They're there and feel great. The house isn't those things physically, it is just more than itself. For being a signifier that it intensely balanced with this signified.

Try pushing back against the everyday symbolic naturalness - symbolism is every part of our lives.

The houses are built on stilts. They are afraid of witches and zombies. They want to meet face to face. They are afraid of meeting witches and people who aren't human.

When people see a house, they call it a 'death house' and that somebody died there. Similarly, there is a category for death house that symbolises that there's an affinity with death and house.

Signifiers 'make present' signified in different ways. Death platform means house, but pushing away and separate kind of way.
