## [[Benedict Anderson]] , Imagined Communities

Nation states are sovereign communities that have formal boundaries. A nation state is not a place where absolute rule is placed by a higher authority. Rather, a nation state is supposed to have a citizenry that participates in government and administrative governments. A third characteristic: a nation state is a community. Despite differences in people, those people must imagine in some extent some common interest or experience.

That is the common definition used by a nation state. To place that in context, there are many countries in the world that have collective meanings and identification - they are located all over East Asia or the Middle East. Institutions like the holy roman empire or the catholic church lost their ability to give absolute authority.

Instead, Benedict Anderson argued that nation states are "Imagined Communities." A vast majority of people who make up a nation will be individuals who don't and will not ever see or here, but somehow we believe that we share some values and experiences with them.

This process can be seen in public expressions of national identity - ritualised practices and discourse. Imagined communities rely upon shared symbols, rites and discourses - mass media here is a precondition of national consciousness.

When the printing press was published, people could publish ideas in everyday language and not just Latin - within weeks, people spoke the same language and could speak the same thing. Furthermore, that type of media established the idea that there should be a 'common national language'

Nations do exist and do exist on similarities of culture, history or economy. Rather, when we say imagined communities we are discussing how a nation creates a collective sense of itself. Even after the printing press, national media makes a big part of our consciousness.

## We will discuss how nationalism relates to colonialism

Post-colonial societies often have an important relationship. That said, almost all historical sources argue that European colonialism created new nation states according to externally imposed criteria.

For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, most political life focused on the lives of kingdoms, highly complex political units based on shared political identity. These complex political units are generally a smaller size than nations. The lines of international society cuts through national borders or conversely, colonialism tried to create an ethnic nation state of the European model where they haven't existed before.

For example, in very diverse territory of British India, British colonial territory and colonial authorities tried to imagine what an independent nation state should look like. The partition of India came at an awful cost, millions of Indians and Muslims found themselves existing in a state of Muslims and Hinduism. Relations between those two communities quickly became violent, and in the span of months, we found one of the largest amount of forced migration in history. Fourteen million people crossed the borders in either direction.

There was a widespread massacre of refugees and in the span of months, two millions of people murdered and women sexually assaulted.

[[Partha Chatterjee]] argues that despite the fact that nations impose on colonies in outside forces, nationalism was a structuring principle of anti-colonial struggle in most parts of the world.

The nature of colonialism was to dismantle existing power structures. This meant in most parts of the world, anti-colonialism wasn't in the position to enforce a new type of political community. It could either propose an independent nation state of the European model, a model that is under the basis of global politics.

Former colonies sought to define and emphasise their folk culture. Post-colonial imagined communities project an image of cultural robustness.


### Is there a broader insight into how nationalism achieves a greater level of populism?

Many social scientists are interested in the rise of far-right populism.

Many political scientists seek to explain that development in the lack of trust of the efficacy of political institutions. Are those explanations useful? Those types of explanations approach these issues in a global light sensitive to history.

People believe that the rise of the far right is fundamental with a decline of democracy - things like the Capitol riots. However, the perspective of this depends on the vantage point you are looking like. They project an idealised picture of how the world should look: that vision underpins the entire political project. From the words of politicians giving speeches, how to respond to a foreigner staring at you and more. Irrespective of you believing this politics, the point is that the current moment is currently perceived as a golden age of politics, a period where politics has become a basis of politics and meaning.

A second problem with social scientists viewing this concerns the global picture - the picture looks only new if you're looking at the very narrow lens of North America and Eastern Europe. Back in the early 1990s, far right nationalism has rose. People speaking English magazines or whatnot think that Trumpism emerged out of nowhere: you must pay attention to the rise of Hindu nationalism 30 years ago.

Even if the world looks like its in the grip of a far-right national crisis, it's actually been happening for a long time. For vast sums of people around the world, it's not even perceived as a crisis.

It's not either new or a death or politics, then that leaves us with the problem of why nationalism is seen as more significant some more times than others.

Far right nationalism appeals to desires for security and meaning. Nationalism also emerges at moments of change and uncertainty - in places of extreme collapse.

## Summary:

Nations are relatively recent, and ongoing social constructions.
Nationalism requires a great deal of social work in order to be propagated.
Anderson's work of imagined communities explains how large swathes of people who don't know each other in fact imagine that they do.
Nationalism is not necessarily a conservative political force that resists change and invites discord: as post colonial theorists have argued, nationalism is a way of thinking about political projects.
Far right populism emerges in contexts of insecurity and uncertainty.
