## Lecture information:

What is infrastructure anyway?
Infrastructure as modernity.
Infrastructure as ecology.

A pipeline bursts; soldiers demand payment at a security checkpoint; a secretary puts you on hold. For anthropologists, infrastructures are empirical objects worthy of study (built systems that facilitate movement—or storage—of people and things), and sometimes even a kind of analytical lens in their own right (‘grounds’ that give rise to ‘figures’). Rooted in histories of capitalism, imperialism and development, their accelerating growth and decay in the Anthropocene has stirred an array of anthropological reflections on the nature of collective life. While we may think of infrastructures as tacit or invisible, we will find that they are often highly visible or otherwise sensed. If we think of them as stable or subtending, we will discover them to be complex and ever-shifting ecologies of people, artifacts, materials, and events. Finally, whereas we may think of infrastructures as politically neutral, we will cometo see how they are intimately bound up in questions of justice, belonging, suffering, and aspiration

## Lecture notes:

### What is infrastructure anyway?

Made up of many parties, a system that created connectivity between people and things. For example, a road is a road that connects people and others.

infrastructure can be temporal - a refrigerator is infrastructure as it connects the present and future, negates the spoiling of food.

School can be infrastructure - input, output, students and graduates. Input - output. 

Another way to put this is that infrastructures is an ecology that you move around that we don't think about. That is unless something goes wrong: to the able bodied, stairs are just there and part of our ecology. To folks in wheelchairs, they are an intense object of concern, frustration and irritation as it stops the infrastructure of wheels, ramps and objects that constitute the disabled person's mobility.

Standards are what create inter-operability between systems, allowing more complex systems to develop. It is a complex system that allows us to create an ecology of connection. But as we can intuit from the example, standards have politics.

Building and stairs have implicit orientation and assumptions that are invisible to people who are using them naturally. We format ourselves to the infrastructure that is out there: the admissions of Cambridge we have slipped through by standardizing ourselves to those traditions. The study of infrastructure thus can be incredibly interesting - taking the tacit and taken for granted assumptions of everyday life. It is what gives us our taken for granted assumptions.

One of our most basic infrastructure is language which if you haven't acquired it, will mark you as an outsider.

Thus, infrastructure allows us to view the norms that shape them.

This suggests that people have a degree of agency in the ways that people engage with infrastructure and this can have limited effects. The best example are 'desire limits' - someone cuts across the grass and leaves a cut of trampled grass. Infrastructure creates these inflections and otherwise, people tweaking them in varied ways that allows them use.

This, thus, becomes a political object. 

As a living record, infrastructure develops in historical time. Think of calendars. We are still using the Julean (?) empire that we still use long after the Roman empire or Aqueducts that people no longer hold water in. Even the human skull is a form of infrastructure.

The infrastructures that we rely on are becoming increasingly unstable - kindling that creates problems, it is an ecology that is unstable in many parts of the world as so much of modernity is about the delivery of large-scale systems.


## Infrastructure as Modernity

Infrastructure holds a capitalist productivity. Early on, aspiring capitalist in the long 16th century needed to find a way to gain raw materials for their long growing empires so their colonies in Manchester or whatnot can process them into raw materials.

As these economic operations expanded, we have a problem of institutions that produced things efficiently. We created the railroads to account for this: infrastructures designed for economic productivity begin to grow and develop through this interoperability. The telegraph grows with the railway in almost real-time.

They are also key to the developments of new things. Consider the steam engine - it has a number of disadvantages compared to water mills. You put a water mill next to a stream and the input is consistent. Using a steam engine by contrast, you have to supply it with coal. However, you can construct it anywhere, reducing the transaction costs of bringing in these water mills.

There are natural features of the world - night and day, water and not. Infrastructures are about transcending the material constraints that produce the economic capabilities of production, a timeless self-enclosed system. 

Infrastructures have a strong effective component - the construction of infrastructure highlights the particular relation you have with a certain time and space. The particular photograph (on the screen) is about the replacement of gas lights with electric lights.

The instalment of these technological devices have a symbolic quality. For example, the construction of the train and ornaments. Just as in some sense that poetry is about the feel of the word the poetics about the infrastructure is not what they do, but also how they feel.

As so much of the post colonial infrastructure project, the ideas is about the fruits of these systems, to see if countries could join a collective system - with the Tanzanian dam, the construction of the dam had children claim that socialism would found its opponents (?).

Lenin, in Mongolia, was compared to life - there were light bulbs that were made to commemorate Lenin.

One role played by [[Michel Foucault]] is to outline the power and coercion of infrastructures - arguing that schools, prisons and factories are all the same as they play a role in not only socialising you, but also disciplining you. Algorithmic government plays a key role for example in deciding that.

Another stream of scholarship sees how infrastructure affects perceptions and norms: for example, Franz Fanon: "The town belonging to the colonized people ... is a world without spaciousness; men live there on top of each other, and their hurts are built on top of each other." 

Who gets infrastructure? Who gets excluded? Infrastructures distribute goods and bad in its very design.

Who is disproportionately affected by gas from incineration? Young African children. Clean air, dirty air, ways to black.

Crucially, it shows how belonging and citizenship is not only an abstract phenomenon but also how citizenship is embodied in a relative distribution of harms and goods.

If infrastructures materialize social relations, social relations can bend and reshape infrastructures. For example, Julia Elliots (reading list) finds how (Kryrene??) women meet together and do nothing at all: a phallic labour, keeping social channels open between people so that if you need anything of substance, information or a favour, that constant maintenance work is an infrastructure sociality that allows these things to happen.

People are infrastructure in the broad sense for people to assemble possibilities. Those are just the contemporary approaches.

People could be said to be infrastructure in the sense that they are labour - coal workers were the vanguard of labour struggles as they occupy that chokehold in that they could suffocate an entire infrastructure.

So much of political activism takes the form of blocktivism - blocking pipe lines.


## Infrastructure as Ecology

There was a hope that the developing world would converge on this structural ideal. That is to say independence from any post-colonial nations would involve the treatment of modernity. In such situations, infrastructures become invisible - a capitalist brand of infrastructure was about visualising the artificial life support systems that we reside on.

Electric heat replaces the fireplace and removes soot and smell.

Much of consumer life is about engaging a seam where the backstage labour is replaced. We do not know the condition of what brings us our iPhone. Capitalist modernity likes to hide the backstage of economic life.

The more we integrate into this economic world, the threat that it may spin out into nuclear war is an ever present shadow. The shadow of mutually assured destructions rests.

The complex interconnections of systems create a butterfly effect where a small cause might cascade in a huge consequence. Terrorism in the 20th century rests on this logic.

Just a few people with guns or knives can exploit a system of airlines and televisions in what we call infrastructural events. We are so ramified and interconnected that if we find the right point we can create destruction on orders of magnitude on an immense scale.

Also, with [[Rachel Carson]] - Silent Spring, the decimation of ecology through infrastructure.

Infrastructures are built on national resources and they circulate that. They are intimately tied to the age in which humans and nature become entangled in ways that become unsettling.

Using the global network of human bodies as its bodies - human are parasites on the earth and the parasites live on in human bodies (Jim Scott). As the worlds infrastructure get more and more vulnerable, experts reinforce an idea of resilience of bouncing back from unpredictable change so you can get back to normal (eventually).

It shows the tidy life straws that fill in the gaps of infrastructure survival. What do you do when infrastructure breaks down?

Now, a key tenant of resilience is that nature itself becomes infrastructure - moving past the modernist hubris of infrastructure, and moving into something that is living nature. Take Oyster architecture built on a oyster shell type that takes contaminants and filters water to be pure.

Another function of these reefs are to build up and perform a resilience to flooding. By the same token, it is the same kind of infrastructure.
