## Houses and Time

Korowai people:

There's no calendar, no years, no seasonality that meant that the years are a salient unit.

The length of time a house takes to be occupied - a house falling down takes a year or two. People build a house, live in it, eventually it deteriorates.

You must ask them in the series of houses they live in.
Their memory and their own life was marked across by these houses.
It's a memory palace - a time and series of time about where these houses are.

To sum up: people's sense of time are heavily spatialized. 

Look at the ceilings of the houses - the bones of animals. Why do that? They say, it is to see the goodness and prosperity. The ceiling of the house. We can see how long people live there, things people have bee eating over their months and years.

We know what symbolism is and how it is discussed in our everyday lives.

A symbol is, as we understand it, something that stands for something else. A statue of Edward Colsten stands for something that lives in the past: it created who we are, it represents a lot. Taking the statue down and dismantling it. The smiling emoticon stands for happiness.

A signifier - a symbol *means* something and has a meaning. People's lives consist of elaborate networks of symbolic connections. They're ghostly and we constantly live in a ghost world.

The presence of temporality is more subtle and multi-layered than what it is in a dictionary.

The history of meals and social relations are the same thing: the house, and the ceiling, is symbolic of family and the quality of life people are living there. Another level of what houses are socially are is socially: houses have a women's territory and a man's territory. We have two halves of this house.#

It's a mark of 'you don't belong here' and yet you are here. There are no phones so guests are interesting and surprising. People get really quiet and there's no - hey, great to see you! - because that would be rude. Instead, the house owners start preparing food for them. What you do when people enter the house is also signifying meaning about belonging and not belonging and so on.

There are many homes in different places. They have their places of belong. This flows across the physical existence of these houses. Houses signify social relations.

Let's move to abstract things referring to these descriptive things: two points.
1. Things in our life symbolize social relations and that theme has been incredibly important in SAN work about symbolism. Valuable works here include *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1912)*.

A short version of the argument in this book:
- Durkheim's question - what is religion - becomes the meaning of what do people find in totems? Totems symbolize the importance of clan groups. Encountering and meeting your clan groups origin animal, emblem, colours and people actually view is the power of the social collective, not the power of the animal, emblem or colour.
- Society needs symbols - we need collective representations to hold society together and make people know that they're 'in' society. Symbols make that a pretty hard thing. It's why people being together in one place, coordinating their activities around each other that people have direct experience of this abstract social collectivises. They find that experience energizing and pleasurable.

Clothing and everything and anything tattooed on our bodies - they're obviously personal and subjective. They have feelings and desires and ownness.

Durkheim's theory is blunt - it is circular, supposed to answer everything, builds its answers into its assumptions. Not all symbols symbolize society. There is no account for actual form of symbols - why do they take this specific form? What about the social meanings people attribute to these symbols? What is any given social relation?

2. The other part, all people don't feel that there's a difference between the signifier and the signified. Instead, we live our lives tacitly or semi-consciously: a photo of a person you have unconditional love towards. You can't cut out their eyes without it feeling wrong. You say 'shit', the sound is more than the sound alone - the sound and knowledge that the speaker is crude and vulgar. From his accent, some people believe that the lecturer is from the US. Those vowels are physical sounds, but people believe that these stereotypes of American words, they make the present something else that is not present in them. Same thing for Kurowai houses, these houses do not symbolize their houses in a symbolized, ordered way: they are very real and they're very much in the house. They're there and feel great. The house isn't those things physically, it is just more than itself. For being a signifier that it intensely balanced with this signified.

Try pushing back against the everyday symbolic naturalness - symbolism is every part of our lives.

The houses are built on stilts. They are afraid of witches and zombies. They want to meet face to face. They are afraid of meeting witches and people who aren't human.

When people see a house, they call it a 'death house' and that somebody died there. Similarly, there is a category for death house that symbolises that there's an affinity with death and house.

Signifiers 'make present' signified in different ways. Death platform means house, but pushing away and separate kind of way.

Second lecture N/A - to be covered later!

Third lecture:
17/11/2023

To cover the end of the previous lecture, what wild boars signify among Kiwai:
1. Humans
2. Masculine ferocity
3. Difference of men and women
4. Complicated relation of similarity and antipathy between men-associated killings and women-associated reproduction

This is a sort of Structuralist analysis. Would the Kiwai themselves had said this about the symbolic meaning of pings (pig = moguru ritual = men's house = masculine killings).

Since the 1970s, most anthropologists have rejected Structuralism as a framework because of the assumptions linked in there: the idea that symbolic order is unconscious, and that structuralism holds that if you can sift through loads of data and patterns, you can identify the symbolic order regardless if the people living in those symbolic order are cognizant of the order.

Other assumptions (such as [[Claude Levi-Strauss]]):
- **Symbolic order is mainly unconscious** (what this lecture covers)
- People live in one bounded symbolic coherent order
- Symbolic order is outside of time and history
- **Symbolic order is separate from use, action or practice** (What this lecture is covering)
- Symbolic order is separate from the material world
- Symbolic order is separate from power, evaluation or desire

What is symbolic order is particular to someone's particular interests? What if structural order exists out of that?

Today, we will look at linguistic anthropology which has a lot in common with structuralism in the sense that it focuses on signification and meaning as things having lots of meanings. more-so than they're made of. They see activity being at the heart of the social order.

We will study two examples.

## English speakers using 'fake Spanish expressions' in their English conversations

A style of English.
[[Jane Hill]] calls it 'mock Spanish': common in the US, the most famous example used in the movie Terminator Two. The boy teaches the terminator to be more cool, telling them bits of Spanish: the terminator uses mock Spanish ("Hasta la Vista, baby.").

What Hill shows is that there are three layers of meanings in a mock Spanish utterance. She uses a tough jargon versus denotational (dictionary) meanings versus connotations.

When people say something in mock Spanish such as "I'll do it manana", they're using the denotation: I'll do it later.

There's a second order direct indexicality that the **speaker is easygoing and jocular**.

Then, there's a third meaning of indirect indexicality: the stereotype that **Spanish speakers are lazy, procrastinators, temporally unreliable.**

Other mock Spanish uses imply in the background imply Spanish speakers as sexually loose, insincere, vulgarity and more. It's hard to identify layer two and nearly impossible to identify layer three. Layer two speakers may be aware of the connotation but don't understand the pejorative meaning.

One pattern of this is to use words that aren't inherently funny in Spanish and imbue it meaning to English. For instance, Spanish people say "Adios" which doesn't mean much except goodbye. English speakers use "Adios" to argue in, good riddance, goodbye in a negative way. Here, beneath that second level of the speaker's jocular persona, there is an indirect stereotype of an ethnic type of Spanish speakers being stereotyped, treacherous.  

The boy Connor says "Adios" when tossing the arm of the terminator into molten steel liquid to destroy it. But the terminator says 'goodbye' when moving himself into the molten steel, sacrificing himself. In other words, treacherous goodbyes mean 'adios' and heartfelt goodbyes simply are 'goodbyes.'

Perhaps this suggests that Hill is onto something, as Spanish speakers being insincere or treacherous. This stereotype is not denoted by the speaker, but denoted by the white person's use of mixing.

For someone to be racist, people believe that their racism has to be intentional and if someone doesn't self-consciously mean to be racist then they are not. However, the racism can be semi-conscious *and* collective. People take the cultural structures in place without really meaning it, only arguing for intentional racism.

## Joking patterns among a patch of people in Arizona, United States in the 1970s

This is similar but in a different political economy to the mock Spanish.

At that time, Apache adults spoke with awareness of the broader understanding of the environment around them. An anthropology left something for an Apache woman. By accident, the recorder was on.

Bahr found that these Apache people imitated a white person:
The situation follows - these is this Apache guy L knocking on the door of a husband and wife. The husband starts yammering at the guy in English - "Hello my friend! Sure, it's my Indian friend, L. Pretty good alright!"

Everyone was pretty humoured and everyone cracks up. The wife, at the end of the joke, claims that 'white men are stupid!'.

So, we can apply this to mock Spanish: there are multiple layers of representation are going on in this joke.

There's 5 levels of signifiers:
The signifier: "Hello, my friend!"

Signified 1: dictionary meanings of his words

Signified 2: white guy greeting guest, being hospitable

Signified 3: the husband is putting on an act, the joking routine is drawing attention to itself as a special interaction. The joker is two people at once. He is an actual Apache guy *and* a stereotypic white guy he is pretending to be.

Signified 4: white people are immoral, joker affirms Apache values: the joker uses this act in more specific things that signify that the contrast between white people and Apache, signifying with a moral feeling that white characteristics are bad. The humour works as a caricature, coming from Apache cultural sensitivity.

Recall the fact that they opened up with "Hello, my friend!" as though they're mocking the white people for considering people as friends without meaning it. Then they address the subjective state: "How you doing? How you feeling? You feeling good?" For them, this is a violation of privacy. Then, the Apache people like to go and not draw attention, contrasting this: "Look who just came in. Sure, it's my Indian friend!" Then, he addresses their name: "How you feeling L ... You sure looking good to me, L." It seems strange to them. Also, the Apache people touch the guest: on their shoulder, looking them in the eye. This is seen as animal-like. Also, the Apache orders the guest, "Come in my friend!" which is seen as a violation of autonomy. He asks a ton of questions which violates a lot of Apache norms: "You hungry? You want some beer?" Also, the Apache person asks, "Maybe you get sick" - they believe that talking about sickness produces as such.

This short and quick interaction are a whole lot of interactions of Apache norms. These criticisms affirm sign's use. "White men are stupid!" There is a reinforcement between how to make a meaning: the pantomime way of enacting that meaning. The humour comes from the pantomime performance than saying it directly.

Signified 5: buckskin between jokers.

The fourth level was about relations between white people in general. But this layer of meaning is going on and being created among the Apache that are present: one broad meaning the joking makes present is a feeling of humour. All of these first four layers interact with each other to create a feeling of levity and transgressive-ness. What's here on the slide at layer 5 is a further more specific effect that jokes have among levity and humour. The humour of close friends symbolises that this is a special social relation where we violate rules of connection that cannot be violated with general category of people - you wouldn't joke that way! So this part of the meaning of joking claims to be in this relation.

This breaks the rule of equality - don't act better than other people. The transgression of these rules break only those that you're in a deeper relation with. 

*Another example of someone pretending to be a GP bandaging another hand. They make presumptions about people, about taking influence and bandaging others. The "white man" is acting uncivilized.* 

The person addressed by the joker is made uncomfortable by this interaction and so that person being joked at says "enough" as something is becoming uncomfortable. The Apache take the joker as taking a claim of superiority. Why? We can affirm these values of how monstrously impolite it would be to do this. In the relation between these two specific people. The joker is affirming the friendship and flexibility of this relationship, doing something really rude to demonstrate how good of a relationship they have.

# To wrap up:

People *do things* with symbols in action, creating new realities. They make realities in action. They joke and affirm societal values.

Symbolic order can be about the situation of use: again with the mock Spanish joke, people are drawing attention to themselves as an artful speaker: they are using this language artfully.

Symbolic order is order *about* symbol use, about the doing of symbolism. Signifiers 'make present' signified in different ways.

Indexicality is a specific way signifiers make present signified. Just translate it to connotation. It is a tool of talking about the larger problem.

A lot of this is adapted from [[C.S. Peirce]]:
- Iconicity - a relation of likeness between signifier and signified
- Indexicality - there is a relation of proximity or continuity between signifier and signified
- Convention - the signifier and signified are connected by an arbitrary rule.

One example, "um" - it does not denote anything with the dictionary definition. Instead, 'um' characterises the person saying it to the situation of speech, saying something of 'hold the channel clear, bear with me, I'm nervous, whatever, I'm wanting to attend these.' It indexically holds to these meanings rather than having to say it all out.

It matters a lot of how people experience the force of relations and examples. Given how people say adios or manana.

## Topic one

Korowai lived in this outer periphery of global market connections and make their livelihood from the rainforest, in the 1990s they were met by tourists. They have been visited by 10,000 tourists and 50 TV shows: these tourists come from all over the world.

Tourists believe that the Korowai embody the past: they live in nature, not are degraded by money and they are specifically fascinated by the idea that some Korowai have never seen white people before.

There is a connection here: Korowai symbolise the bad things of a tourists life.

In Korowai thinking (the focus of this lecture), to get at what tourist signifies we will start from the main word:

```ad-seealso
title: Linguistic Symbolism: two words for tourists
*Tulis* - borrowed from the Indonesian word **turis in the late 1990s**
*laleo* - literally 'zombies', applied to radical strangers since the early 1980s.
```

When Korowai borrow the former word into their landscape, they imbued a different meaning: an ethnic proper name. Tourists are tourists when they came on their trip and know each other in their homeplace. Tourists like government officials, traders, church workers and Korowai take the name 'tourist' as the main prototype of people coming in. 'Tourist' includes Asian and they are generically talked about. Tourists can mean 'city person' or 'foreigner' or 'white person': an ethnic category.

The term 'Tulis' (tourist) signifies an ethnic group. Something we can call symbolism and symbolic order has a logic of its own.

The shock of tourists and what they were like characterizes them like non-human people: *laleo* was the first word used. We can think of Hollywood zombie as they are similar: people and monsters that we all become when we die. Korowai are petrified of them. These zombies want to be reunited with their living relatives, wanting love but meeting them will cause the Korowai to die. Relatives are supposed to support each other, and want to give a food gift but you can never reciprocate their affections.

People use symbols to characterize their daily lives. They had the category of zombies and used it. Korowai refer to themselves as human, and characterize zombies as the opposite of that. It was pretty apocalyptic. This is a pretty big version of xenophobia and ethno-centrism.

A broader issue about symbolism that ties into the idea that symbolic order exists. It is the relationship between symbolism and subjectivity - consciousness, mental and emotional lives. What we think.

### "Ideology interpellates individuals as subjects." - Althusser

[[Althusser]] comes from a Marxist background. He believes society is this giant system of inequality and wants to consider how these systems reproduce itself over time.

He looks at ideology and views it as more important that coercion: and so this sentence summarises his idea on how ideology is effective. Subject in the sentence means conscious person. Notice the interesting spelling of 'interpellates' - rather, what this word means is 'to call out to' with addressed person recognising themselves in the call. It's like you're walking down the street and the policeman calls 'Hey you!'

Another anthropologist: the emphasis placed on mothers to dedicate themselves to bento preparation interpellates women into extreme commitments to carry their men. Also, it interpellates men into relying on these women. Finally, it interpellates the children into accepting the authority.

Something noteworthy: the appreciation of these interpellations.

Althusser argues that our thoughts and feelings matter to how society works, made in the image of the symbolic order or system. It gives an account of how good symbolism feels.

Symbolic order sets the terms of what people think and feel. Explaining subjectivity is difficult: if those tools can be linked up to explain why people have the consciousness they do, it is a really big deal.

For the last step today, we will recognise as this as really wrong and seriously partial and incomplete. A counter-pattern (from everyday activities) is that people are reflexive on using symbols. Think about this broadly: the metaphor of a 'window', if symbolism is a window, experiencing a window we don't see the window but what is outside it.

The point of the focus is the meanings that it makes present, what we can access through the symbolic process. In a lot of symbolic processes we are aware of the processes mediating the meanings that we're accessing through.

An example: a study by [[Ilana Gershon]] to see how uni students in the US thought about the intersection between romantic relationships and technological media. She wanted to consider the different means of breakup - privately, over text and more. And so across that range of possibility, the information that the students communicated symbolically was the same. I break up with you. It is the same thing. We're not a couple anymore.

People have strong reflexive ideas on what is appropriate and what to use one form or media over another. Another vein of symbolic media is from the reading list: [[You Can't Talk behind the Holy Spirit's Back]] and his ideas around spoken language. What people do reflexivity is what they undergo and pick apart on what different symbolic media in their lives and do: it is not a one way relationship where we are completely shaped by the social order, we consider, we understand, we dissect together symbolic media.

What we think of as art are places where language speakers reflexively focus on the shape of communication and media. And painting is about a sensory expression of media: let us see 'looking' as a process in of itself. Playing with and looking for alternative meanings of symbolic order, of what people are living through.

Some Korowai take money from tourists, gaining activities. Perhaps we can see tourists as gaining changes and new institutions and consumer culture. They are a concrete form we are encountering. They find painful of how much material prosperity exists in other people's lives that they have very little access to.

They are a symbol of global geopolitical inequality: basically, for the last meeting at 2017, the Korowai were asked to narrate about the history of tourism and how Korowai tourists cooperated with each other. They wanted the professor to help fix this situation of inequality and ask the government for good exchange relations and good balance of material conditions and financial aid.

Looking back to Althusser: people don't recognise themselves fully in the categories of symbolic order. With their relations to this form of category of human that was called 'zombie', all these Korowai people went from fearing them to admiring and desiring them. They see their own past life and current life as being not automatically good - in a troubled relation to their own symbolic order.

Their symbolic order is inconsistent and says multiple things at once. There is a mix of being consciously reflexive, having critical distance from it, semi-conscious and unconscious taking for granted behaviours. These varied patterns of relations to symbolic order is central to an anthropological study.

There is something that the Korowai is taking for granted is the grand concept of inequality: of course, that is what people are concerned about. The tourists come the U.S to help our  inequality. In this regard, this symbolic order is taken for granted.
