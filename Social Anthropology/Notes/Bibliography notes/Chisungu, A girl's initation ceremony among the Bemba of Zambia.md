## Introduction:

17

The twofold aspect of puberty is ... of great importance for it gives rise to the variety in the types of ritual with mark this physical event in the life of the boy and girl in primitive societies.

One tribe may stress the actual attainment of physical puberty and the magic protection which the first signs of sexual maturity are believed to require.

In another, a greater emphasis may be laid on parenthood, and the puberty rites may be predominantly rites of fertility.""


## Part 1: The Cultural Setting

25

"The Bemba were the dominant tribe on the North-eastern plateau of Northern Rhodesia. They have a centralized government with a paramount chief, the Citimukulu whose empire formerly consisted of the territory between the four lakes ... The Bemba are still proud of their former position as a ruling tribe and feel that their traditions should be kept alive. Women as well as men are conscious of their superiority over the surrounding people.

The Bemba are a small tribe."

"The Bemba practice shifting cultivation of the slash-and-burn type."

"Women are responsible for most of the food supply ... to make a garden ... the women pile them [branches] in the centre of a cleared patch so that they may be burned to form an ash bed on which the seeds are sown ... dragging together of the branches."

26

"Great emphasis is placed on a woman's importance in controlling and husbanding the food supplies. Many forms of Bemba ritual centre around the production of food."

They typically eat food in bushes: vegetables, mushrooms, honey and caterpillars. 

"A Bemba girl of about ten or eleven is able to distinguish carefully among the thirty or forty different kinds of mushrooms used and can tell which are edible and which are poison-able."

27

"The Bemba divide their world into village and bush - the village representing the civilized, orderly way of life and the bush a more mysterious, dangerous environment which must be cajoled to yield its resources for men's benefits."

"Pottery is the only craft in women's hands."

"The Bemba have no form of storable wealth until the arrival of the European ... the wealth of the Bemba consisted of the right to demand services from kinsmen and proteges and formerly from slaves, rather than of the accumulation of goods."

"Barter was ill-developed and markets non-existent. A certain amount of food was distributed from village to village in fulfilment of kinship obligations."

## IDEOLOGY AND DOGMA

The Bemba attribute their blessings and misfortunes to supernatural agencies, which are set in motion either by persons, dead or living, or by impersonal magic forces, good or evil.

The personal beings include:
1. The spirits of ancestors (guardian spirit)

29

2. Malignant spirits (violent death)
3. Living persons who can produce good fortune by blessing which they do chiefly by calling on ancestral spirits to which they have special right of address; or cursing, which they do through some less specified evil force.

Impersonal forces include:
1. Magic in general ... which is the force contained in the leaves, roots or barks of various trees.

30

2. The magic influence of sex, blood and fire which when brought into wrongful contact with each other, are though to be highly dangerous to every Bemba but particularly to babies and young children.

"Sex relations ... make a couple 'hot'. In this state it is dangerous for them to approach the ancestral spirits in any rite of prayer or sacrifice ... for the chief to be so casual in keeping sex taboos, or to approach his ancestors without purification is 'to spoil the land'.

"All persons of sex maturity are distinguished by a special term ... and are excluded from a number of rites on the ground that they are 'hot'."

The author gives examples of not touching the fireplace of a hut for it may endanger the child through the gruel.

To remove the dangers due to sex intercourse a special ceremony is required and this one which can only be performed by a legally married couples. Hence the close links between the rules of ritual and those governing marriage ties, and the great importance of magic belief in determining' the strength of marital relationships.

At marriage each girl is presented by her paternal aunt with a miniature pot about 2 1/2 inches in diameter .. it is filled with water and placed on the fire ... water from the pot is then poured by the wife on to her husband's hands, and some say on to the wife's as well. New 'pure' fire is then relit either by means of fire-sticks or as is usual nowadays, with matches. This ... rite is the essential act which removes ... hotness from the body of man and wife and renders them free to touch a hearth with impunity or to approach the ancestral spirits.

32

The most constant danger to the family fire is in fact the touch of the housewife herself, when she is passing through one of her periods. Then she must be careful not to touch the family fire that her husband or her children use. She has her own small fire ... intercourse with her husband would be almost unthinkable for her during these days and there are heavy peanlties attached to the showing of the menstrual blood by accident.

The author claims that she must be made to sit over a fireplace till her flesh was scorched as an example.

32

The author claims to talk about sources of danger, such as intercourse with a girl after her initiation ceremony, considering it a perilous act and it must be carried out with special ritual precautions and in the case of a chief, it must be undertaken by a special court official ... who takes the risk on himself.

It is this act above all others which initiates the ritual relationship between husband and wife.

One of the most fatal acts of all was for a girl to bear a child before she had been initiated or before one of the ... rites now performed at puberty was carried out. Her child would then be a creature of ill-omen.

The reader will have gathered that strong mystic links are though to exist between husband and wife. If one partner dies, the other must sleep with some social equivalent of the dead ... to 'take the death off' the living partner.

This is only one example of the belief that the guardian spirit ... and the blood of man and woman mix in sex relationships.

For mother and daughter to sleep with the same man ... is a terrible thing. For an adulterer to pass the dead body of his mistress's husband, or any other man who has slept with her, is also a danger to all men concerned.
