This is a great example of [[Structuralism]] and [[Clifford Geertz]]'s work: see [[Interpretivism and Structuralism]]

---

This is an example of thick description. Let's read on.
I will provide appropriate page numbers, but I will mostly skim it. It is a novel-lite after all.

56

Geertz and his wife arrived in a Balinese village, a small place of 500. For the Balinese, Geertz and his wife were nonpersons, spectres, invisible men.

People ignored them often. Nobody greeted them, but nobody scowled at them either. If they wanted to talk to someone, they moved away.

This was studied: villagers obviously observed every move they made, and they had a lot of information about them ... they just treated them as though they didn't exist. It's not just Bali, it's everywhere - Indonesia, Morocco and so on!

57

Then, there was a cockfight. They're kind of illegal, often bringing radical nationalism with the cockfighting.

Drinking happens often and the police feel compelled to come in and fine people, expose them, confiscate the cocks. 

This means fights are held in a secluded corner of the village in semi-secrecy. Sometimes, they raised money for a school that governments were unable to give them - but today, there's a notion that bribes had been paid.

58

Obviously, they were wrong. The police came in and broke everything up.
Everything was messy and chaotic.
Therefore, Geertz ran with everyone.
Without any prompting, his wife brought out food, sipped tea and stuff.
The policemen asked what was up, and Geertz' host rose to his defence, giving a description of who they were.

And everything changed!
Suddenly, they were the centre of attention.

59

People were suddenly interested, asking of them of their occupation, teasing them - even inviting them in to a courtyard to chat about what happened.

Bali is a well-studied place ... but the cockfight is not mentioned at all.

60

There's obviously a big thing about cocks - it's actually a huge double entendre, with the same tired puns, jokes and obscenities.
They are very, *very* masculine symbols.

The word *Sabung* represents hero, warrior, lady-killer, tough guy and so on. A desperate man is likened to a dying cock whereas a pompous man is compared to a tailless cock. A stingy man - a cock that leaps at the other. A marriageable young man - a fighting cock caged for the first time. Even court trials are compared to cock fights.

61

The intimacy of men with their cocks is more than metaphorical - they feed, groom, discuss them, or gaze them with self-absorption.

They are super cared for, fed a special diet, bathed, groomed, trimmed,

I am cock crazy.

It is true that cocks are symbolic of the owner's self, but they are also expressions of what the Balinese regard as the direction inversion of human status: animality.

The Balinese despise any behaviour regarded as animal-like. Babies are not allowed to crawl for this reason. Even incest is a less horrifying crime than bestiality.

62

Even demons are considered animals.
Not only defecation but eating is regarded as an obscene activity to be conducted privately.
Even *clumsiness* is considered bad.

In identifying with cock, the Balinese man is identifying not just with his ideal self but also his penis and what he fears, hates and is interest by - the powers of darkness.

The connection with cockfights and the animalistic demons that invade space is explicit: in a cockfight, a blood sacrifice is offered. No temple festival should be conducted until one is made.

In this cockfight, man and beast, good and evil unravels in a drama of hatred, cruelty, violence and death. It is little wonder when the owner of the winner takes the carcass of the loser to eat, doing so with social embarassment, moral satisfaction and so on.

Cockfights are held in a ring about fifty feet square - beginning late afternoon and running 3 to 4 hours until sunset. They have 9-10 separate matches and there is no main match, no connection between individual matches, no variation - each is arranged on a completely ad hoc basis.

63

The cocks have their spurs affixed - a job so precarious only a few men from each village really know how to do. If the rooster wins with the spur he assisted, the owner awards him the spur-leg of the victim.

It is a very deliberate affair and spur lore is crazy! They are extensive, sharpened only at eclipses and the dark of the moon.

The spurs affixed, the two cocks face each other and - you guessed it! - fight each other with an explosion of animal fury.

64

Kind of like boxing, the trainer medicates and repairs the cock - putting the whole chicken head in his own - blowing it, fluffing it and so on. He is usually forced to put it down but he is usually drenched in chicken blood.

The cock usually dies. What counts is which cock expires first.

These rules are written in palm-leaf manuscripts passed down from generation to generation. The umpire is in charge of their application and his authority is absolute - we've never seen an umpire be considered incorrect.

65

[[Erving Goffman]] calls this a focused gathering - a set of people engrossed in a flow of activity, relating to one another in terms of that flow - such gatherings meet and disperse, but they take their form from the situation that evokes them. The floor is created, the status is celebrated and so on.

In classical times, bringing a cock to a fight is a compulsory duty of citizenship, taxation of fights was a huge source of revenue. Today, the newer rectitude makes an open statement of the excitements of collective life and those of blood sport impossible.

Let's talk about gambling.

The Balinese are always a very complicated bunch.

There are two bets: the axial bet in the centre between the principals and the cloud of peripheral ones around the ring between members of the audience.

66

Now, it's a very complicated matter.
Consider each as vice versa: the first is large, the second is small, the first is collective, the second is individual, the first is deliberate, the second is filled with shouting, the first is always money and the second one is never such.

They gambled a lot of money in these centre bets, but side bets are very chaotic.

I will skip the side bets, but just know it's very loud and has lots of shouting.
Feel free to return on this.

68

This is best referred to as, in areas of 'real cock-fighting' as chaotic: the mob scene quality, the sense that chaos is about to breach and so on followed by intense silence when the cocks are down.

Anywhere from fifteen seconds to five minutes later, all bets are paid. There  is no concept of an IOU.

69

Some connections: the larger the centre bet, the more even the match. In short, in a large-bet fight, the pressure to make a match a genuine 50-50 is enormous. It goes down.

The higher the centre bet, the greater is the pull on the side betting towards the short-odds end of the wagering spectrum and vice versa. The higher the centre is, the greater the volume of side betting.

The close the fight is in fact to even money, the less attractive the long end of the odds - the shorter it must be if there to be takers.

70

The power of the centre bet in pulling the side bets towards its money pattern is huge - total wagering is greater in large-centre-bet fights because fights are super interesting. As for volume, total wagering is greater in larger-centre-bet fights because fights are considered interesting - less predictable, and that money is more at stake to them: money, quality of the cocks, social prestige.

The paradox of fair coin in the middle, biased coin on the outside is biased: they are part of a larger system in which the centre bet is the centre of gravity.

The Balinese attempt to make an interesting deep match by making the centre bet as large as possible is curious and makes it unpredictable. But it does not always make the cock-fight succeed.

71

[[Jeremy Bentham]] concept of 'deep play' is play in which the stakes are so high it is irrational for men to engage in it.

The men are over in their heads, and have entered a relationship of net pain rather than pleasure.

Despite this, men engage in this often - for the Balinese, the explanation lies in the fact that in such play money is less a measure of utility than it is a symbol of moral importance, perceived or imposed.

In shallow games - money and cash for pleasure and pain.
For deep ones - money, but most importantly, status.

72

No one's status is *actually* altered by the outcome of a cock fight, it is only insulted - but for them, nothing is more pleasurable than an affront delivered, particularly when mutual acquaintances are watching.

This is not to say that money does not matter or that the Balinese don't care about losing money. Money does matter, matter and matter very much that more of it one risks more than a lot of other things.

In deep cockfights, an owner and his collaborates put their money where their status is.

It is in large part because the marginal disutility of loss is so great that at high levels of betting, it is to lay one's public self through the medium of one's cock. This irrationality increases the meaningfulness of it all.

It is actually in the shallow fights where one finds the handful of pure addict-type gamblers who are in it for the money. They get disparaged. Addicts.

73

This correlation of "status gambling" with deeper fight and inversely "money gambling" with shallow ones is general - betters form a sociomoral hierarchy. There are a large number of mindless, sheer-chance gambling games - only people who don't do cock fights (women, children for example) do this.

Above those are people who do not themselves fight cock, but bet on smaller matches.

There are those, the citizenship who fight and bet on them in the side. These men dominate talk - they are "the true cockfighter."

What makes Balinese cockfighting deep is not money but what, the more of it that is involved the more so, money causes to happen: the migration of the Balinese status hierarchy into the body of the cockfight. It is an equally Aesopian representation of the complex fields of tension set up by the controlled ... interaction of those selves in the context of everyday life.

74

The cocks may be a simulation of social matrix, the involved system of cross cutting, prestige - the necessity to affirm it, defend it and so on. This is a 'status bloodbath' to take Erving Goffman.

Let's talk about the village:
1. The village is dominated by four descent groups who form the major factions in the village, there are subfactions within them, subfactions within the subfactions and so on.
2. The village itself, endogamous, opposed to all other villages around its cockfight status but also forms alliances with certain of these neighbours against others in supravillages political and social. The general pattern of status rivalry between corporate but various based groupings is entirely general.

The cockfight is fundamentally a dramatization of status concerns.

Take the following:

77

There is a lot!
The general point is well-defined and the whole argument can be summarized in a formal paradigm.

![[Pasted image 20231023235409.png]]

Inverse arguments hold that the shallower the fight, culminating, in coin-spinning and dice-throwing amusements. For deep fights, there are no limits though there are practical ones and legends (tales of the Duel-in-the-Sun combat between lords and princes).

78

One of the great culture heroes of Bali is called The Cockfighter.

The cockfight too, in this colloquial sense, makes nothing happen. Men go on allegorically humiliating one another and being humiliated, glorifying quietly only to be crushed.

No one's status really changes however. You cannot ascend the status ladder, nor can I descend it.

79

All you can do is enjoy and savour it - the cockfight.

The cockfight renders ordinary, everyday experience comprehensible by presenting it in terms of acts and objects which had their practical consequences removed to the level of sheer appearances, where their meaning can be more powerfully articulated.

The cockfight is 'real' only to the cocks - it does not distribute anything, does not do anything, does not refashion hierarchy or anything.

A cockfight is a means of expression, its function is neither to assuage social passion nor to heighten them.

The question of how it is that we perceive qualities in things - paintings, books, plays - neither the sentiments of the artist ... can account for the agitation of one painting or the serenity of another.

The dis-quietfulness arises out of a conjunction of three attributes: its immediate dramatic shape, its metaphorical context and its social context.

80

It is a pretty dramatic shape - a characteristic that does not seem remarkable until one realizes that there does not have to be one there.

Each match is a world unto itself - the loser is not consoled, people drift from them, winners are not congratulated and events are not rehashed.

Balinese however live in spurts - they arrange their life and perceive is, less a flow, a directional movement out of the past, through the present, toward the future than an on-off pulsation of meaning.

81

In focusing activity down to a burning-glass dot, the cockfight is merely being Balinese in the same way in which everything from the monadic encounters of everyday life, through the pointillism - it is an example of Balinese fight.

If one dimension of the cockfight is its structure, its lack of direction makes it a typical segment of general social life - but the aggressiveness makes it a contrast to normal ways of life. In the normal course of things, the Balinese are shy to the point of obsessiveness of open conflict. Oblique, cautious, masters of- they rarely face what they can turn away, but here they portray themselves as wild and murderous - manicism.

The slaughter in the cock ring is not a depiction of how things literally are among men, but from an angle what they imaginatively are. 

The cockfight talks about status relationship, arguing they are of life and death.
Prestige is a profoundly serious business in Bali.

Only in the cockfight are the sentiments upon which hierarchy rests - they are expressed here in only the thin disguise of an animal mask. Jealousy is a part of Bali as poise, envy, brutality but without the cockfight the Balinese would have a much less certain understanding of them ... perhaps why they value it so highly.

Any expressive form works by disarranging semantic contexts in such a way that properties conventionally ascribed to certain things are unconventionally ascribed to others.

To connect the collision of roosters with the divisiveness of status is to invite a transfer of perceptions from the former to the latter - a transfer which is at once a description and a judgement.

What sets the cockfight apart from the ordinary part of life is that it provides a meta social commentary upon the matter of assorting human beings into fixed hierarchical ranks and then organizing the major part of collective existence around that assortment. Its function is interpretive ... it is a Balinese reading of Balinese experience; a story they tell themselves about themselves.

To put the matter this way is to engage in a bit of metaphorical refocusing:
it shifts the analysis of cultural forms from an endeavour in general parallel to dissecting an organism, diagnosing a symptom - to one penetrating a literary text.

If one takes the cockfight to symbolise something, the problem is not with sociological principles but social semantics. The question therein is what could someone learn from examining culture as an assemblage of text?

28

To treat the cockfight as a text is to bring out a feature of that treating it as a rite or passage would obscure: its use of emotion for cognitive ends. What the cockfight says it says in a vocabulary of sentiment, risk, despair and so on - not merely that risk is exciting, but that it is of these emotions that society is built and individuals put together.

Attending cockfights is for the Balinese a kind of sentimental education - what he learns there is what his culture's ethos and his private sensibility look like when spelled out externally, that the two are near enough alike to be articulated in the symbolics of a single such text.

29

Every people loves its own form of violence - the cockfight is the Balinese reflection on theirs. It brings together themes: animal savagery, male narcissism, opponent gambling, status rivalry, mass excitement, binding them into a set of rules which at once contains them and allows them to play, building a symbolic structure, the reality of their inner affiliation.

Balinese go to a cockfight to find out what a man, usually composed and aloof, feels like when attacked, challenged or triumphed.

It is this kind of bringing of assorted experiences of everyday life to focus that the cockfight accomplishes, creating a paradigmatic human event, one that tells us less what happens than the kind of thing that would happen if life were art and freely shaped.

The cockfight enables the Balinese to be read and reread.

30

Because of this, subjectivity does not properly exist until organized, art forms generate and regenerate the subjectivity they pretend only to display. It is in such a way, colouring experience with the light that is cast, that the arts play their role.

Here, the Balinese forms and discover his temperament and his society's temper - discovering a face of them. The cockfight is not the masterk key.

31

What it says about that life not unqualified.

The culture of a people is an ensemble of texts which the anthropologist strains to read over the shoulders of those to whom they properly belong. Nor is it the only way that symbolic forms can be sociologically handled.

Let's address their substance, okay?
