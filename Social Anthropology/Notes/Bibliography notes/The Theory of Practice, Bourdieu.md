[[Practice Theory and Marxism]]
# 1 Objection Objectified

30

Bourdieu, throughout his book, wants to argue in favour of practice theory - willing to investigate the interactions between larger, objective structures of society and the individual - the thread that connects activism with his method is his understanding of society as a struggle of symbolic and material forces.

He examines Saussure - finds that speech is "the precondition of a language" language that cannot be apprehended outside of speech - and that these two processes are chronological and that the relationship is reversed as long as we try to decode it.

From this, language and their mutual understandings comes to increate intelligibility. The point of view creates the object, indicating the viewpoint one must adopt to produce the 'specific object' of the science: to make speech the product of language, one must situate themselves in intelligibility.

31

Let's concentrate on the viewpoint itself - the relationship to the object that it asserts and all that follows, the theory of practice. This is imagined as one trying to objectify the place in advance of the objective, the objectifying observer who, with the possibilities offered by the objectifying instruments, imposes on the object in his own norms of construction.

To locate themselves in the order of intelligibility, we adopt the viewpoint of an "impartial spectator" who tries to assign this intention to the agents' practice and proceed as if they were asking themselves the questions that he asks himself about them.

He constitutes this as a logos, not a praxis, taking it as an object of analysis instead of using it to think and speak.

The principle is that sociolinguists take a formal relation towards all language, not taking their object as formal language - just speaking it for practical purposes, just for their urgency and needs for practice.

32

Our understanding of language is passive - stripping it from its real usage and of its function. Mastery of the code is not just mastery of the proper use: it is not that language is just to made spoken to.

33

It is Anthropology, disposed by its identical viewpoint on the object to reckless borrowing of concepts, exhibits the implications of the question-begging of objectivism.

People view foreign language as a means of decoding, not means of action and expression. The practical relationship the anthropologist has with his object has been totally excluded from the real play of social practices.

The anthropologist's situation reminds us of the truth of the relationship that every observer has with the action he states and analyses ... seeking to make it understood than by producing and reproducing it practically.

34

Participant observation is, in a sense, a contradiction ... the critique of objectivism no way implies the rehabilitation of immersion in practice. We're just avoiding the real relationship of the observer to the observed.

Anthropologists would be able to escape from all their metaphysical questioning about the ontological status ... if they were to objectify their relation to the object.

To understand kinship for instance, the anthropologist takes for granted the native terminology of kinship as a closed, coherent system of logically necessary relations.

35

The anthropologist then fucks up if he's not reflexive enough, imposing obligations and prohibitions. He brackets the different uses which may be made in practice of sociologically identical kinship relations - the family tree, the beaten tracks and more.

Only by means of a break with the theoretical vision, a break with ordinary vision, can the observer take into account in his description of ritual practice, of the fact of participation - only an awareness of the limits implied can enable him to include the complete theory of ritual practice properties.

Projecting the unthought content inherent in his position leads him to identify htte work of though with an effort of expression and verbalization.

37

Anthropologists have never known how to rescue the people they were studying from the barbarism of pre-logic except by identifying them with the most prestigious of their colleagues - logicians or philosopher. Even [[Claude Levi-Strauss]] does it, conferring on myth the task of resolving logical problems.

The indeterminacy surrounding the relationship between the observer's viewpoint and that of the agents is reflected in the indeterminacy of the relationship between the constructs that the observer produces to account for practices and the practice themselves - we infer the mode of thought and the meanings.

Simply by leaving untouched the question of the principle of production of the regularities that he records, giving access to the 'mythopoeic' power of language, objectivist discourse tends to constitute the model constructed to account for practices.

Giving concepts the power to act in history as the words that designate them act in the sentences of historical narrative, personifying collectives and makes them subjects responsible for historical actions. It preserves appearances by resorting to systematically ambiguous notions.

38-39

Do you recall how passages in Structural Anthropology on the relationship between language and kinship and rationalizations produced by the natives were rejected in favour of the unconscious structures?

![[Pasted image 20231028212413.png]]

Wittgenstein here is discussing the problem of language - how are we supposed to know the exact definition? The meaning he imparts into his work.

40

Meaning is hard, let's consider the two differences between the sentence "Consider the difference between saying "The train is regularly two minutes late" and "As a rule, the train is two minutes late" - in the second case, one acquires the means of proceeding as if the principle were the theoretical model one has to construct in order to account for it, setting up the principle of practice or institutions objectively governed by rules unknown to the agents, finalities without posited ends.

41

If the dialectic of objective structured and incorporated structures is ignored, one falls into the canonical dilemma, recurring in new forms in the history of social thought. To make transcendent entities out of the constructions that science resorts to to give an account of the structure, one reduces history to a 'process without a subject.'

## 5 The Logic of Practice

80

Those who have the monopoly on discourse about the social world have a different view when thinking about themselves as others - materialist towards others, liberal for themselves and so on.

The anthropologists would have been less inclined to use the language of the mechanical model but thought of the games they play in social life - skills, dexterity, delicacy - setting aside the exchange of gifts and words and considered exchanges in which errors are paid for instantly.

81

They should've paid attention to how even a polite conversation is a game - the prepared gesture and words and so on but not too much attention otherwise they will lose sight of what they truly mean. One has to go back to one's own games, one's own playing of the social game, to realize that the sense of the game is at once the realization of the theory of the game and its negation qua theory.

When one discovers this theoretical error, one sees the antinomy between the time of science and time of action which destroys practice - practice unfolds in time and it has its correlative properties. However, science has a time that is not practice: time disappears for the analyst as he has the time to overcome it. Science is only possible when ignoring the effects of time.

82

One has no chance of giving a scientific account of practice unless one is aware of the effects that scientific practice produce by mere tonalization. As seen in ritual practices, the cumulation of relations of opposition and equivalence which are not mastered by any one informants can only be produced by reference to different situations.

The analyst is liable to fall into errors that flow from the tendency to confuse the actor's point of view with the spectator - looking for answers to a spectator's questions that practice never asks because it has no need, instead of wondering if the essence of practice excludes such questions.

83

In contrast to practice, whose mode of construction obliges us to use a successively, linear series of signs to express relationships which the mind perceives or ought to perceive simultaneously and in a different order, it makes it possible to use the surface area as more or less representing systematic relations and links.

84

Through this we can verify the relations between successive reference-points and divisions, giving rise to all kinds of relation.

85

The perfect model of society as a series of interlocking units which those like [[The Division of Labour in Society|Durkheim]] set out cannot be fully accepted unless one ignores the arbitrariness of all the divisions. 

86

Practice has a logic which is not that of the logician. This has to be acknowledged in order to avoid asking of it more logic than it can give, condemning oneself to wring incoherence out of it or to thrust a forced coherence upon it.

This practical logic is able to organize all thoughts, perceptions and actions by means of a few generative principles, which are closely interrelated and constitute a practically integrated whole.

Symbolic systems owe their practical coherence - unity and regularities - and 'fuzziness' and incoherence being inscribed in the logic of their genesis - product of practices that can fulfil their practical functions only in so far as they implement ... practical that are not only coherent.

87

Ritual practice performs an uncertain abstraction which brings the same symbol into different relationships by apprehending it through different aspects, or bringing different aspects of the same referent into the same relationship of opposition.

88

This uncertain abstraction is also a false abstraction which sets up relationships based on what Jean Nicod calls 'overall resemblance', a mode of apprehension that never limits itself, but takes each one, each time, as a whole, exploiting to the full the fact that two 'realities' are never entirely alike in all respects but are always alike in some respect.

This explains, first, why among the different aspects of the indeterminate yet overdetermined symbols it manipulates, ritual practice never clearly opposes aspects symbolizing nothing, which might therefore be disregarded.

89

The language of overall resemblance and uncertain abstraction is still too intellectualist to be able to express a logic that is performed directly in bodily gymnastic ... by inducing an identity of reaction in a diversity of situations, impressed the same posture on the body in different contexts, the practical schemes can produce the equivalent of an act of generalization that cannot be accounted for without recourse to concepts.

90

Logicism inherent in the objectivist viewpoint inclines one to ignore the fact that scientific construction cannot grasp the principles of practical logic without forcibly changing their nature. 

91

And there is reason to think that as soon as he reflects on his practice ... the agent loses any chance of expressing the truth of his practice, and especially the truth of the practical relation to the practice.

In contrast to logic, a mode of thought that works by making explicit the work of thought, practice excludes all formal concerns. Reflexive attention to action itself, when it occurs ... remain subordinate to the pursuit of the result and to the search for maximum effectiveness of the effort expended. So it has nothing in common with the aim of explaining how the result has been achieved, still less of seeking to understand ... the logic of practice, which flouts logical logic.

92

The idea of practical logic without reflexion is a contradiction in terms, which defies logical logic. It is unaware of the principles that govern it and the possibilities they contain.

The professional dealers in logos want practice to express something that can be expressed in discourse preferably logical, finding it hard to conceive that one can rescue a practice from absurdity.

Probably the only way to give an account of the practical coherence of practices and works is to construct generative models which reproduce in their own terms the logic from which that coherence is generated.

93

The science of myth is entitled to describe the syntax of myth in the language of group theory, but only so far as it is not forgotten that ... this language destroys the truth that it makes accessible.

94

The poet immediately identifies the principle of the relationship between the internal space of the house and external space in the opposing movements of going in and coming out. As a belated small-scale producer of private mythologies.

If ritual practices and representations are practically coherent this is because they arise from the combinatorial functioning of a small number of generative schemes that are linked by relations of practical substitutability that is capable of producing results that are equivalent in terms of the logical requirements of practice.

The discussions that have developed about systems of classification, both among ethnologists and sociologists, have one thing in common: they forget that these cognitive instruments fulfil, as such, functions that are not purely cognitive.

95

Practical taxonomies, cognitive and communicative instruments which are the precondition of the constitution of meaning and consensus on meaning, exert their structuring efficacy

To react, as Levi-Strauss does, against external readings that cast myth into primitive stupidity must not lead one to forget that magical actions are 'this-worldly' - dominated by the concern to ensure the success of production and reproduction, survival. Their ambiguity stems that in pursuit of the real ends that emerge in situations of distress, they apply a practical logic.

It is as if ritual practices were wishes or supplications of collective distress, expressed in a language that is by definition collective - forlorn attempts to act on the natural world as one acts on the social world.

The least inappropriate way of understanding this would be to compare it to the private rites those of extreme distress would invent.

96

One sees both the ordinary errors and their basis that lends itself to the most contradictory reading - there is a lofty distance which objectivist hermeneutics seeks to keep between itself and elementary forms of thought. On the other hand there is this de-realizing enchantment of the great initiates of the gnostic tradition who make common sense function as lived meaning and make themselves the inspired subjects of an objective meaning.

Objectivist reduction can bring to light what it calls the objective function which myths fulfil, but by separating the objective meaning that it brings to light from the agents who make it work, and therefore from the objective conditions, it makes it impossible to understand how these functions are fulfilled - participant anthropology regards the anthropological invariants and the universality of the most basic experiences as sufficient justifications for seeking eternal answers to the eternal questions of cosmologies and cosmogonies in the practical answers.

By cutting practices off from their real conditions of existence, the exaltation of lost wisdom dispossesses them of everything that constitutes their reason and their reason to be, locking them in mentality.

![[Pasted image 20231028232319.png]]

Rites take place because they find their reason to be in the conditions of existence and the disposition of agents who cannot afford the luxury of logical speculation or metaphysical angsty - it is not sufficient to deride the most naïve forms of functionalism to be rid of the questions of the practical functions of practice.

The Kabyle marriage cannot be understood on the basis of a definition of the functions of marriage as an operation intended to ensure the biological reproduction of the group in accordance with forms approved by the groups.

97

It would not be better to understand it on the basis of structural analysis which ignores the specific functions of the ritual practices and which fails to consider the economic and social conditions of production of disposition generating both these practices and the collective definitions of the practical functions that they serve.

To understand ritual practice means more than reconstituting its internal logic: restoring its practical necessity by relating it to the real condition of its genesis, describing the most brutally material bases of the investment in magic, such as the weakness of reproductive forces, causing a life to be dominated by anxiety.

It means trying to name this collective experience of powerlessness which is at the basis of a whole view of the world.

The relationship between economic conditions and symbolic practices is realized through the function that is assigned to indissolubly ritual and technical practices.
