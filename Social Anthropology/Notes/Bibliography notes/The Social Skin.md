The surface of the body behaves as not only the boundary of the individual as a biological and psychological entity but as the frontier of the social self as well.

The problems involved are ones all societies undergo - a society's ways of socialising individuals, integrating them to which they belong, not as children but throughout their lives.

The surface of the body becomes the symbolic stage upon which the drama of socialization is enacted and bodily adornment becomes the language it is expressed.

The adornment of the body is a serious matter.

The Kayapo are a native trade of the southern borders of the Amazon forest - living in widely scattered villages. The economy is a mixture of forest horticulture, and hunting and gathering - a complex system of institutions. The basic social unit is the extended family household, boys live in the households of their wives upon marriage.

They possess a code of 'dress' - a well turned out male may have a lower lip plug, a penis sheath, large holes pierced through ear lobes, red and black body paint, shaved head. A closer look shows that the 'savage' is covered in a fabric of cultural meaning as a Victorian.

The first point is about notions of cleanliness - Kayapo must bathe once a day, it is conceived as a state of full and proper integration of the social world whereas illness is conceived in terms of the natural and animal forces. The removal of facial and bodily hair carries this principle of transforming the skin from naturalness to a social filter.

Inside the skin, hair grows. Outside, it is dead. The hair of the head focuses the dynamic and unstable quality of the frontier between the natural forces of the inner body and external sphere of social relations.

So important that variations in coiffure have become the principal visible means of distinguishing one tribe from another. Some categories of people are privileged to wear their hair long, others must keep it short - children, adolescents, mourners must have their hair short. Penis sheathers keep it long.

Why?

Parents are though to be connected to their children and siblings, a tie of a spiritual continuation of the common physical substance that they share through conception and the womb. The death of a person's child or sibling thereby diminishes his or her own biological being and energies. In so much sorts of biological relationships are cut off by death, is the symbolically appropriate response to the death of a spouse as well as a child.

Nursing infants hair is never cut, seen as extensions of the biological and sexual being of their long-haired parents. Cutting the hair symbolises the severance of this bio-sexual continuity. The child's hair remains short as a sign of its biological separation from its parents.

Society is epitomized for the Kayapo by the system of communal societies and age sets - a collective organisation a primarily male domain. They are defined in terms of criteria for recruitment, defined as a corollary of some important transformation in family or household structure.

Men reproduce society through the transformation of their natural biological and libidinal powers into collective forms. Women, by contrast, reproduce the natural biological individual, the elementary family. It follows that women's biological forces of reproduction.
