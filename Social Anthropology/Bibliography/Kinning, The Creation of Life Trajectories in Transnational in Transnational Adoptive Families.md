>With empirical material obtained from a study of transnational adoption in Norway, an argument is made for the concept of kinning. By this is meant a process by which a foetus, new-born child, or any previously unconnected person, is brought into a significant and permanent relationship that is expressed in a kin idiom. Through a focus on adoption within a cultural setting that emphasizes the flesh and blood metaphor as central for kinship, the ambiguities and contradictions embedded in the relationship between biological and social relatedness are thrown into sharp relief. Questions of race and ethnicity also become pertinent to the kinning drama of adoptive parents which involves, it is argued, a process of transubstantiation of the adopted child. Despite the strong desire to be a ‘normal family’, families with transnationally adopted children always remain different in some sense. To obtain a child, and to create a family, is so demanding that those who succeed learn a lot about themselves in the process.

## A summary of the article:

This article discusses transnational adoption as a means for involuntarily infertile couples to create a couple. Adoption is a topic of very little interests to anthropologists, and adoption is helpful in discussing values of relatedness.

The author argues for a kinship studies revolving around kinning.

```ad-quote
By kinning, I mean the process by which a foetus or new-born child (or a previously unconnected person) is brought into a significant and permanent relationship with a group of people that is expressed in a kin idiom. I wish to suggest that to kin is a universal process, marked in all societies by various rites of passage that ensure kinned subjectiviation. (465-466)

```

Through a process of kinning which involves a transubstantiation of the children's essence, adoptive parents enrol their adopted children into a kinned trajectory that overlaps their own. Issues pertaining to time and place become central in this process.

Adoptive parents and their children recreate each other intersubjectively. Through being kinned, the adoptees qualify their personhood through their relations to others (primarily their adoptive parents) just as the adoptive parents, through kinning, adjust their personshood through their relations to each other.

"The idiom of kinship, moreover, is one that is grounded in a biological connectedness of shared substance." (466) this substance is reflected in substantive elements - the relational quality of blood as shared in defined categories of kin that provides the social dimension of kinship.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### How children become transubstantiated into the Norwegian family.

This section focuses on how a sense of belonging is transmitted to adopted children after they have been allocated to their new parents - a process known as **transubstantiation**.

```ad-quote
"Parents must take account of the children's different biological, geographical and cultural origins, as well as of their former relationships, and at the same time fix them permanently not only into the present, but also into the past of their new family and kin. Only then may the children become integral partners in the shaping of the familial future." (468)
```

In Norway, the nuclear family seems to be ideal - people want two to three children, a house and close contact with grandparents and adult siblings. For couples who fail to give birth, due to high birth rates (approximately 92 percent by the age of 40) much of Norwegian social life revolves around bringing up children and thus there was a massive pressure on them. Without being able to produce children, they were excluded from the social world surrounding them.

Blood is a common metaphor for descent as it is amongst the [[David Schneider|Americans]].  The future becomes predicated upon such continuity, and the reproduction of continuity is anchored in kinship. Adoptive families cannot anchor their continuity in shared flesh, blood and history and thus must transubstantiate the child.

###### There are multiple stages to the kinning of adopted children:

```ad-summary
First, a couple decides and realises that they cannot sire a child and focus on the hopes and expectations of becoming a family, registering with an adoption agency.

Pregnancy is said to start the moment the couple is approved by the Norwegian authorities - during the time it takes for the donor country to provide them the child, the agencies provide the parents with journals, pamphlets and books that deal with transnational adoption.

When a child is allocated, birth begins - expecting parents are sent a photograph of the child and its personal details. The child's room is made ready. Parents become emotionally invested towards these not-yet encountered children.

Then, adopted children are treated as *tabulae rasae* where they undergo a rebirth - the main actors being the parents, bureaucracy and the judiciary. Each child is given a new name, citizenship, birth certificate and essentially 'de-biologize origins and to transubstantiate the child's essence, kinning the adopted child into their parents' network.
```

Belonging to a place plays an integral part in personal narratives but adoptive families struggle to compensate for shared history. There have been multiple attempts to distance adoptees from their origins and incorporate them into their new social environment.

The author illustrates this through photographs:
```ad-example
"Through photographing the adopted child in places of parental descent or belonging, the child is being symbolically planted in them." (472)
```

Children learn to speak Norwegian, like Norwegian food, engage in Norwegian activities and 'come home' - arriving where it was meant to be all this time.

Thus, one way to kin these children is by effecting their transubstantiation through a series of measures that place them in the soil of ancestors, incorporated into parents' kin and rendering biology irrelevant.

Another way is to create an origin narrative that involves a discourse of fate - parents rarely feel that the choice of a child is chance, and that they are 'meant for each other.'

In certain contexts, the different origins of the child is emphasized. Adoptive families gather at social get-togethers, and the special quality of their shared situation creates a sense of community between adoptive parents. Those who have travelled and lived together to collect children have created a community of shared origin. In maintaining these relation, parents seek to engage in Norwegian sociality - interacting in ways that are recognizably kin-like.

### Paradoxes inherent in the kinning of transnationally adopted children

Successful transubstantiation of the transnationally adopted child involves fixing it in a wider set of relationships expressed in a kin idiom. Once a child arrives, parents put effort into ensuring that the child becomes involved in a wider kin network - studies have shown that adopted children spend more time with their grandparents than biological children do.

Adoptive parents are concerned with being 'good parents' and engage in a number of activities organised for them. Being adoptive parents make themselves anxious and reflexive about their status - the kinning of adopted children requires more effort than that of biological children.

Adoptive parents are torn between being a 'normal family' and taking account of special circumstances - mostly, they ignore the special origins of their child and put effort in transubstantiating it, but also pay attention to demands that they must teach the child to take pride in their 'original culture.'

In keeping with a growing focus on biological relatedness, adoption agencies have encouraged adoptive parents to learn about the donor country but the conceptualization of culture here is both reified and superficial, confined to cultural markers that are easily consumed. Parents thus try to solve this dilemma through family return visits to the child's country of origin.

Parents often try to return to the 'roots' of the child's past to help the child acknowledge the dual source of their identity as well as understand the 'backpack' of personal history and genes that the child has arrived with. However, the underlying motive is the confirmation of the child as a kinned Norwegian person. 

### 'Roots' - returning to the motherland.

The author then describes his experience interviewing children who were going to South Korea.

In Korea, it was parents who insisted upon the significance of the moment of arriving at the orphanage, of inspecting the hospital or more. Children went along with this happily but where more engaged in the shops and food but were impressed when they visited the rooms they resided in - cots. Through these return visits, the children return to their original identities.

The author suggests that they don't - the messages transmitted to the adoptees are contradictory as they are Korean and not Korean at the same time, they look but do not feel Korean, cannot speak the language and know nothing about history, customs, institutions or moral values. They are constantly disorientated.

```ad-quote
"Thus, during the visit to Korea, the Norwegian families dchose to focus on place and objects rather than onp ersons. They apparently desired history without people - or rather without kinned people."
```

When in the country of origin, roots became synonymous with place, food, costume and more. People were first identifying with the orphanage, the second being the place where the child was born or had been found and nothing else. In a sense, this does not threaten the integrity of the family while acknowledging the different origins of its members. "Pursuing the child's past together becomes a family adventure and the events become incorporated into subsequent family history." (480)

Here, adoptees confirmed their Norwegian identity. This trip strengthened family bonds and adoptees found that they had more in common with other adoptees than the youths they met in their birth countries.

Some adoptees express a desire to locate biological relatives. By large, those who actively search are those who have failed to settle in Norway and find adoption hard to live with - seeking a solution to their personal problem. However, the author notes that they want to see their biological relatives as to see what one looks like - they wish to situate their own physiological make-up. But often, when meeting up the shared natural substance loses its significance.
