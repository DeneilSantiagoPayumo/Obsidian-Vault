>Malay polygamous families are living rather fragile and fragmented lives: many survive on intermittent access to the time, affections, and economic support of the husband-father who oscillates between each wife and her children in different houses at irregular intervals. But the travel restrictions imposed by the MCO make it difficult for polygamous husbands to keep up with their rotation.

>This precious time lost may mean a corresponding decline in the economic investment of the husband as the income will be allocated to the family that commands most of his time and attention. Here, co-wives compete for resources that are insufficient. In times like these, women are propelled to draw on the support of their kinship network for childcare.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Polygyny in Islam and Malaysian Islamic Family Law

The Qur'an itself states that "you cannot do justice between wives, even though you wish it...".

Now, it is more crucial for polygynous husbands to be punctilious in providing material provisions which are quantifiable and amenable to an equitable divison between families. This call for equality is the cornerstone of the codification of polygyny in the Malaysian Syariah system.

Essentially, this ensures that male access to polygamy also treat their wives with fairness. But various loopholes exist within the Syariah that open doors to polygyny that render these restrictions impotent and ineffective - for example, The Malaysian Syriah Courts' legalization of cross-border marriages contracted abroad.

### Malay Polygyny: Past and Present

Polygyny among Malays is associated with the aristocratic elite. Sultans and noblemen were better equipped with the wealth to maintain multiple households.

Men of the emerging new Malay urban elite embraced polygyny, thereby enhancing their own social prestige and elite status in society. It became an act of conspicuous consumption that displayed their moneyed status and economic prowess to attract and maintain multiple wives.

That said, there are plenty of men from the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum who are contracting second marriages without the financial demands - small-scale businessmen for example. These men of modest means look towards remedial solutions for legitimizing love and romantic attraction.

Many women in polygyny, under the pandemic difficulties would be compelled to supplement the role of provider for men. The capacity to maintain multiple families would be compromised. The absence of the husband's role in family life may also force the burden of childcare on women's shoulders.

The silo nature of polygyny adds to this burden - co-wives and children do not live under the same roof. This lack of collaboration and cooperation would present significant logistical challenges. Polygynous husbands' spasmodic paternal involvement explain why despite being more educated, women's participation in the labour market is still really low.

This pandemic will exacerbate economic pressures and lead to divorce. We'll see, however.
