## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Abstract: This article suggests a new conceptual framework for understanding why some types of work are experienced in more satisfying ways than others. The analysis is based on research in an Indian scrap metal yard, where work entails disassembling things that other people no longer want. In spite of the demanding conditions of the labor and the social stigma attached to it, employees express satisfaction with the work process. This observation raises questions about theories of labor, which see satisfaction as arising from work that is creative, skilled, and task-based. The article argues that transformation is a social process that should be used as the primary analytic for explaining work satisfaction. Theories of creativity, skill, and task are secondary analytics that describe subsets of transformative action.

### Vignette

Describes 37 year old Dipesh in the Indian city of Jamshedpur in the spring of 2014, employed in a small family-owned scrap metal yard.

He was anxious about his new job as he's only been in the two weeks. He missed his old life. Although employment in the scrap plastic industry he enjoyed the work because the trade was complex and took many years to master.

Dipesh described the material differences, explained how they were processed for future use, asked to handle the materials - being a newcomer to scrap metal, he was worried that the trade would not be as interesting or demanding as plastic.

An errand boy. A petty criminal. Married his 23 year old wife five years earlier and now raised a two-year old daughter. Member of the high brahmin cast, thrust into situation of ritual pollution - another expression of his cosmopolitan virtues.

Scrap metal at Lohar Enterprise demanded knowledge of material properties of a wide range of metals, an understanding of their respective market values, a grasp of the interpersonal and entrepreneurial skills associated with it, and the technical skills required to disassemble the discarded metal objects.

Poorly paid scrap workers found it satisfying to take apart things, discovering that it was similar to the feeling of building things. This led me to believe.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

```ad-quote
title: 70
There was something common to these processes that made them satisfying. There is a basic process underlying those things could be seen as a 'primary analytic'. This article proposes transformation as that primary analytics, while creativity, skill and task should be regarded as 'secondary analytic' that describe subsets of transformative action. The argument is therefore not posited in opposition to those analytics; rather it is a discussion of what lies beneath them." (70)

"In this article, 'transformation' is understood as the quality of effecting change upon the world. It extends far beyond immediate material engagements, because the world is a social construction comprised not only of the future actions and desires of persons, but equally of imminent substances and objects (cf. Heidegger [1983] 1995). Approached on these terms, the transformation of scrap work may begin with the material re-formation of objects. However, such action makes sense only when it is part of a project of economic value transformation that is both social and imaginative. Transformative work of this type is accurately deemed social, because the products of one’s labour acquire different economic values by virtue of being necessarily evaluated by other persons. Transformative work is also imaginative, since the effective commission of that work entails a prior conception of how the products of one’s labor will be engaged with by persons other than oneself."
```

### How is the article organised?

This article will explore transformative work through the ethnographic lens of problem solving - by which a person determines how to alter the object of their labour, in a manner that realizes a new value - and concomitant imaginations of how products of one's labour might be used by people who could be distant and obscure.

This article proceeds from an assumption that close attention to transformative processes might productively broaden our understanding of how different forms of work are experienced and evaluated. Often waste work and care work are characterized by a non-transformative work that is often associated with female workers. "The ability to be recognized as a person who transforms value is therefore an inherently political question - one that reveals the ideologies and inequalities that will structure any given social context."

Satisfying tasks are rooted in the transformative processes. The transformation at hand is a transformation of economic value.

First, the article will examine the ethnographic context.

## Context:

### Scrap Work:

- Lohar Enterprises employs 10 people whose work is to collect, weigh, chop, crush and sort a variety of metal waste using basic hands tool.
- Most of the yard's material is purchased from entrepreneurial scrap collectors who scavenge and buy metal waste.
- Work processes are enmeshed within social structures of learning and skill acquisition, class, gender, ethnicity and age. Some people's work will be transformative, or valued and recognised him.
- For Dipesh, his work is negatively valued. Additionally, it is made up of [[Social Class in the 21st Century|precarious]] workers who are alienated from social capital. Lohar's labour force is comprised of people in their thirties and forties who migrated to Jamshedpur.
- Employees of the scrap yard lack the security of an extended local kin network.
- The job is physically demanding and requires heavy lifting.
- There is no career ladder to speak of.
- Lohar employees are also isolated from an urban working-class culture centred around employment
- People who work here do so seven days a week with two paid days off per year. They lack contractual guarantee that their jobs will be safe next month or year.
- Despite that, they express satisfaction with the work.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Creativity

Points about creativity:
Intellectual ancestry suggests human beings possess a creative urge to work
See [[Hannah Arendt]] as she argues for a distinction between work and action, the latter describing the transformative capacity to effect change on the world

"I argue that creativity is one expression of a broader family of transformative processes, some of which may not be creative at all. It is the transformative dimensions of a task that endows its participants with satisfaction, as opposed to its creative aspects..." (74-75)

The conceptual slippage stems from a "fetish for creativity ... Which regards artistic process as the purest expression of human identities ... and sees the act of design and building as the fulfilment of fundamental human urges." (75)

Following [[Marilyn Strathern]] insights ... I argue that this analytic emphasis on creativity is itself the product of a Western intellectual and cultural history that privileges discrete processes of becoming, which result in something being definitively made in a complete form. (75)

The assumption that creation is integral to identification with one's labour resets on a selective reading of [[Karl Marx]] 's writings on alienation that confuses the principles of skilled creation with those transformation, and accordingly places a great deal of emphasis on the creative dimensions of artisanship. (75)

I suggest that satisfying work is better conceived as an ongoing process of transformation, with creation being one possible moment of completion that is not present in all such practices.

"The work is an ongoing process of transformation, in which satisfaction is distributed throughout that process. Tellingly, it is when the transformative process stalls that expressions of frustration become most apparent, for example, when a stubborn metal object resists Dipesh's attempts to disassemble it." (77-78)

Taking inspiration from Karl Groos, [[Graeber]] (2018) argues that a lack of job satisfaction in large swaths of the modern labor market is rooted in the inability to see how one’s work impacts the world in a manner that is socially meaningful and ‘caring’. This observation strikes me as broadly correct. However, the ability for one’s work to ‘care’ for the world might be better conceived as one expression of the ability to transform the world (in a manner more consistent with Groos’s formulation). Doing so helps us to account for the satisfaction experienced by persons whose work harms the world but is nonetheless satisfying because it is effective at accomplishing its goals.  (74)

### Skill

Arun uses hand tools in a reflexive way that they are not necessarily designed for: the effective use of such simple tools demands a greater degree of inventive skill than is ordinarily demanded by more complex, mechanized technology. (78) 

Additionally, Arun needs a technical understanding about how things are made in order to take them apart using non-specialist equipment. When asked to strip a motorcycle using a hammer and an axe, he must understand what types of welding and bolts hold the machine together, (79-80)

It also requires a grasp of the business itself, involving the social acumen of haggling with buyers and sellers and the expertise of knowing the material to bargain over. (80)

Skill does not accurately explain why assembly line and scrap work are experienced differently: the degree to which one is able to do things the other cannot has a strong impact on the security of one's employment. It is also a reliable index of the alienation that one man can be swapped for another. This does not explain the problem that people who perform certain types of skilled works routinely find their tasks unengaging while low-skilled activities may be satisfying if directed toward particular types of action.

"The significance of Arun's experiences is that they point to the satisfaction to be had by effecting the transition of objects between different regimes of value. In a space like a scrap yard, cycles of commodification make value a necessary focus of the work process and an important object to which skill may be applied with transformative intent." (81)

```ad-quote
title: 82, on work and skil
By viewing skill in the work process through the lens of transformation, one is better able to grasp the fact that work-based skills that inspire feelings of satisfaction are those whose practice is impactful within a given context (in this instance, an economic one). There is an objective condition by which a person may be said to possess a given skill. However, for the purposes of an analysis of work and political economy, the germane considerations are how those skills are being used, what the social context is that enables their effective application, and how they are valued. A work skill that is not practiced within a context that enables it to be impactful is one that would ordinarily not inspire feelings of satisfaction. The reading of work skills as technologies of transformation provides a more sensitive model that captures the inherently social life of labor, through a finer understanding of how capacities are used.

```

```ad-quote
title: About Graeber (2001), 81-82
Graeber's (2001) theory of value has helpfully deconstructed the notion that value creation is limited to processes of production and consumption. He notes the wide range of human activities that are generative of value and entail neither making nor consuming: his examples include the donning of dress and participation ... by training the analytic lens at a mroe fundamental level of action, I suggest that acts of meaning-making (such as Graeber's rite of passage) share something with the commodity-focused acts of buying, disassemblage, and selling, insomuch as they each have the capacity to be transformative., This is why, under the right circumstances, one might derive satisfaction from trading, just as one might do from artisanship.

```


### Task

How can the secondary analytic of task be reconceptualised through transformation 

For a Lohar Enterprises employee, work is structured around a series of discrete and variable tasks that are governed by the uncertain material loads traded by the scrap yard throughout the course of a day. (82)

At the core of his task is an engagement with the question of what something is worth to different persons at different times and places, and in what form it needs to be presented in order for that value to be realized. By disassembling things in this way, scrap workers are facilitating objects’ movement between the social contexts that **Arjun Appadurai** (1986) and later **Fred Myers** (2001) call ‘regimes of value’. At Lohar Enterprises, this process of value realization entails indirect social relationships with the other actors in the industrial chain, which takes place via a transformative engagement with the object of disassembling itself. (84-85)

```ad-important
title: 86-87
What enables Dev to feel satisfied in his work is not the fact that his work processes are directed to discrete tasks that he controls; rather, it is because those tasks have a notably transformative dimension. The usefulness of understanding work tasks in relationship to transformation is that such an approach uncouples alienation from typologies of labor whose objects of analysis have undergone extensive change in recent decades. In a global context characterized by more widely distributed employment precarity, economic alienation does not correlate in any definite way with alienation from work satisfaction. Were this otherwise, many workers in the affective industries would have higher wages. Likewise, a lack of time discipline does not necessarily imply an identification with that work or meaningful power in the labor market. This assertion is supported by the experiences of many persons working on zero-hours contracts in the so-called gig economy of self-employed labor: although their work is flexible, it is by no means either free or empowering. A focus on the transformative dimensions of a given work task provides the analytic tools to understand how persons engage with their work in a way that is less bound by earlier typologies and is therefore better able to capture the fractured nature of contemporary labor.

## Conclusion

"What is satisfying to Arun, Dipesh and Dev is the transformative movement of an object from one type of value to another by disassembling and sorting it according to different regimes of value. This process entails an applied imagination of how the objects of one's labour will be used differently by different persons as a direct consequence of the work process. Like the rusting bicycles that are taken apart with axes, melted into strips of steel, made into new bicycles, used, and then sold again to the scrap yard, transformations of value have no definitive beginning or end." (87)

"I believe that the motor of satisfaction is the transformative action itself, which is related to economic value in some instances but not all." (ibid)

"The analytic of transformation might be productively applied to broader processes of problem solving, learning, and artistry, in addition to questions of work and economy. The primary contribution of the analytic is to capture the social relations and impacts of these processes, while also capturing the subjective ways in which individuals experience and value doing them." (88)

"The satisfaction of transformation is based upon the ability to see one’s work and actions effecting change. Crucially, I suggest that it is the extent of such a transformation that governs levels of satisfaction, as opposed to any simple binary logic by which something either is or is not transformed. A transformative process of this kind may be creative, just as it may be skilled. But it is not necessary for it to be either. " (89)
