**This concerns the [[Bemba]]**

---

## Introduction:

17

The twofold aspect of puberty is ... of great importance for it gives rise to the variety in the types of ritual with mark this physical event in the life of the boy and girl in primitive societies.

One tribe may stress the actual attainment of physical puberty and the magic protection which the first signs of sexual maturity are believed to require.

In another, a greater emphasis may be laid on parenthood, and the puberty rites may be predominantly rites of fertility.""


## Part 1: The Cultural Setting

25

"The Bemba were the dominant tribe on the North-eastern plateau of Northern Rhodesia. They have a centralized government with a paramount chief, the Citimukulu whose empire formerly consisted of the territory between the four lakes ... The Bemba are still proud of their former position as a ruling tribe and feel that their traditions should be kept alive. Women as well as men are conscious of their superiority over the surrounding people.

The Bemba are a small tribe."

"The Bemba practice shifting cultivation of the slash-and-burn type."

"Women are responsible for most of the food supply ... to make a garden ... the women pile them [branches] in the centre of a cleared patch so that they may be burned to form an ash bed on which the seeds are sown ... dragging together of the branches."

26

"Great emphasis is placed on a woman's importance in controlling and husbanding the food supplies. Many forms of Bemba ritual centre around the production of food."

They typically eat food in bushes: vegetables, mushrooms, honey and caterpillars. 

"A Bemba girl of about ten or eleven is able to distinguish carefully among the thirty or forty different kinds of mushrooms used and can tell which are edible and which are poison-able."

27

"The Bemba divide their world into village and bush - the village representing the civilized, orderly way of life and the bush a more mysterious, dangerous environment which must be cajoled to yield its resources for men's benefits."

"Pottery is the only craft in women's hands."

"The Bemba have no form of storable wealth until the arrival of the European ... the wealth of the Bemba consisted of the right to demand services from kinsmen and proteges and formerly from slaves, rather than of the accumulation of goods."

"Barter was ill-developed and markets non-existent. A certain amount of food was distributed from village to village in fulfilment of kinship obligations."

28

## IDEOLOGY AND DOGMA

The Bemba attribute their blessings and misfortunes to supernatural agencies, which are set in motion either by persons, dead or living, or by impersonal magic forces, good or evil.

The personal beings include:
1. The spirits of ancestors (guardian spirit)

29

2. Malignant spirits (violent death)
3. Living persons who can produce good fortune by blessing which they do chiefly by calling on ancestral spirits to which they have special right of address; or cursing, which they do through some less specified evil force.

Impersonal forces include:
1. Magic in general ... which is the force contained in the leaves, roots or barks of various trees.

30

2. The magic influence of sex, blood and fire which when brought into wrongful contact with each other, are though to be highly dangerous to every Bemba but particularly to babies and young children.

"Sex relations ... make a couple 'hot'. In this state it is dangerous for them to approach the ancestral spirits in any rite of prayer or sacrifice ... for the chief to be so casual in keeping sex taboos, or to approach his ancestors without purification is 'to spoil the land'.

"All persons of sex maturity are distinguished by a special term ... and are excluded from a number of rites on the ground that they are 'hot'."

The author gives examples of not touching the fireplace of a hut for it may endanger the child through the gruel.

31


To remove the dangers due to sex intercourse a special ceremony is required and this one which can only be performed by a legally married couples. Hence the close links between the rules of ritual and those governing marriage ties, and the great importance of magic belief in determining' the strength of marital relationships.

At marriage each girl is presented by her paternal aunt with a miniature pot about 2 1/2 inches in diameter .. it is filled with water and placed on the fire ... water from the pot is then poured by the wife on to her husband's hands, and some say on to the wife's as well. New 'pure' fire is then relit either by means of fire-sticks or as is usual nowadays, with matches. This ... rite is the essential act which removes ... hotness from the body of man and wife and renders them free to touch a hearth with impunity or to approach the ancestral spirits.

32

The most constant danger to the family fire is in fact the touch of the housewife herself, when she is passing through one of her periods. Then she must be careful not to touch the family fire that her husband or her children use. She has her own small fire ... intercourse with her husband would be almost unthinkable for her during these days and there are heavy peanlties attached to the showing of the menstrual blood by accident.

The author claims that she must be made to sit over a fireplace till her flesh was scorched as an example.

32

The author claims to talk about sources of danger, such as intercourse with a girl after her initiation ceremony, considering it a perilous act and it must be carried out with special ritual precautions and in the case of a chief, it must be undertaken by a special court official ... who takes the risk on himself.

It is this act above all others which initiates the ritual relationship between husband and wife.

One of the most fatal acts of all was for a girl to bear a child before she had been initiated or before one of the ... rites now performed at puberty was carried out. Her child would then be a creature of ill-omen.

The reader will have gathered that strong mystic links are though to exist between husband and wife. If one partner dies, the other must sleep with some social equivalent of the dead ... to 'take the death off' the living partner.

This is only one example of the belief that the guardian spirit ... and the blood of man and woman mix in sex relationships.

For mother and daughter to sleep with the same man ... is a terrible thing. For an adulterer to pass the dead body of his mistress's husband, or any other man who has slept with her, is also a danger to all men concerned.

35

Lastly ... Bemba believe that, if a man commits adultery while his wife is pregnant, the baby is born dead. He has taken the spirit of the child ... if the woman is unfaithful while she is pregnant then she herself dies in childbirth unless she confesses and gets medicine in time.

If the Bemba can be said to have an ideological obsession in the sense that they are constantly pre-occupied with one set of fears, it is this belief in the magical potency of sex, fire and blood.

To recapitulate, Bemba dogma stresses the role of the ancestor in determining human fortunes as well as the power of injured spirits, who revenge the injustices they suffered on Earth on the living.

36

It also emphasises the magical powers associated with sex which is linked with feelings of guilt and anxiety expressed in the taboos clustered round marriage, childbirth and the rearing of children.

These beliefs support the institution of marriage since safety from magical dangers is acquired by means of a ceremony which can only be carried out by a man's head wife.

## SOCIAL STRUCTURE

The most characteristic features of the Bemba social structure are its hierarchical and authoritarian type of government.

The political structure of the Bemba is a centralized one.

37

38

A man will pray to the spirit of his maternal grandfather or maternal uncle, if the latter is already dead. The spirit of a maternal ancestor is thought to quicken the child in its mother's womb and to protect it all its life.

39

[Once a man dies], "the heir actually becomes the dead man in a social sense: adopt[ing] the kinship terms the latter used, calling, for instance, 'maternal nephew' the person he would previously would have called brother. The same positional succession takes place ... for women ... in this system women are honoured as bearers of many children and such a woman is said to found a house.

Bemba clan are not segmentary. The effective kinship group within ... is a three or four generation group ... who trace their descent to a common great-grandmother and who remember a village of origin ... the kinship system makes for a great deal of movement from village to village during a man's or a woman's life. The villages themselves change in composition and move from place to place following the shifting cultivation.

Marriage is uxorilocal (husband lives with wife's community) ... a young man who marries goes to live in his wife's village where he builds himself a hut and becomes a member of her extended family.

40

With this system of matrilineal descent the ties between a woman and her brother are very close. The woman produces children who are heirs of her brothers. The man is the natural guardian of his sister's children, and he must be consulted about his uterine niece's marriage and could claim the right to marry her where he pleased. He could protect her ... could generally claim possession of his sister's children ... command the services of his sisnter's son and bid him to follow him to war ... the woman ... could command the services of her brother's daughter and was thought to be able to bless and curse the fertility of the latter's marriage.

After the marriage has been established, and children have born to the union, it remains a question for individual decision whether the husband is given permission to remove his wife to the village of his own matrilineal relatives or whether he will remain for ever with his wife's relatives.

41

It will be seen at once that the pivotal relationships of the extended family ... are the ties between a mother and her daughters. It is the women who attract the husbands who increase the community and it is they who usually remain in charge of the children when the young fathers go away to work in the mines.

There are several sources of tension in this type of kinship system. First, the ties of loyalty which bind a man to his matrilineal descent clash ... with the obligations he owes to his local group, his wife's extended family. At marriage he is separated from the very relatives with whom he is legally identified ... lives in a community based on kinship traced through women and he is economically dependent on his wife's people and working under their orders.

42

The second source of conflict is ... that between the father and the mother's brother for the control of the former's children and this is a tension inherent in the matrilineal system. The Bemba father is head of his own extended family ... he has rights over his daughter's marriage payments and over the labour of his sons-in-laws..."

The Bemba girl is also in a position of conflict when she marries ... her husband may demand to take her ... to some other village where his own relatives live.

43

To contract a marriage a Bemba bridegroom makes a series of small payments ... in return his wife's parents feed him entirely for a year or two.

To European eyes the husband gets the worst end ... since the labour he gives his father-in-law can never be returned in case of divorce; but Bemba consider the hospitality of the bride's family and the many presents of 'respect' they offer: the husband gives a betrothal present ... which is a token such a copper bangle.

44

The stages by which the marriage relationship is gradually developed are as followed:

*The following content is paraphrased*

1. The betrothal - boys and girls meet at dances, the young man then proposes to the girl
2. The courtship visits - the bride and her friends then visit bride-groom in his village ... the bride, if she is nearing puberty, or has reached it, must sit with downcast eyes and will only be tempted to enter her future husband's hut by a little present ...
3. The boy's move to his bride's village - if the bridegroom has reached puberty, he then moves to his father-in-law's village and builds himself a hunt.
4. The food offerings - the ceremonial offering of food, the bride's family brings food, the boy has to eat different food used by the tribe, this is known as formal presentation.
5. The handing over of the bride - at first, the young man asks for someone to sweep his hut and to fetch him water and his betrothed may be allowed to do this for him
6. After this comes the Chisungu ceremony (which will be done later)
7. The consummation of the marriage - bride must be tempted to enter the hut, then intercourse occurs, and the bridegroom throws a burning log out of his hut to the crowd of waiting relatives outside.

46

Social relations in Bemba society consist very largely of the giving and receiving of services.

Wealth consists of the power to command service such as a chief calls for from his subjects.

Service makes it possible for a man to put big fields under cultivation, to bring a big granary and hence to be able to feed more workers in another year.

Service was given to the chief in return for food provided at the capital and also the supernatural powers on which the people believed they depended.

In such a society, the ceremonial expression of respect by kneeling to a superior, clapping hands before him, offering him food in a especially formal fashion, or even rolling on the back is characteristic. 

47

The tensions ... as inherent in a matrilocal marriage system of this kind make these presentations very significant in maintaining a family and village structure which, as I have explained, is of rather precarious balance.

Accepted sex roles - social structure ... consists of a series of social roles which are associated  with membership of the different social groups of which the tribe is composed.

Thrift and slow accumulation of property are not admired since they cannot be achieved in terms of Bemba economy. Children are brought up to sharre everything they have ... they also admire display of all kinds ... the display is not so much of personal possession but of followers and adherents, who walk about with a man of note and praise him.

Bemba admire ceremonious behaviours in personal relations, exact forms of address, the recognition of social precedence and rights to respect ... they delight in circumlocutions.

48

Extreme deference is paid to age. Each child knows his exact position of seniority.

Bemba women share many of these ideals. They work for their chief in his gardens and make the same abject obeisance to him. They have a lively interest in the ritual centred in the court. They play an important part in attracting followers and kinsmen to a village.

Women ... are admired for industry and resources in finding food in the bush. They are honoured for hearing and rearing many children in childbirth.

In the sphere of tribal life women have an important part to play, or rather one that is thought to be important.

Princesses soften act as village 'headmen', wielding political authority but are regarded as chiefs with feminine attributes ... they are not expected to be ruthless in discipline. They have male counsellors to advise and support them ... the senior women have important ritual duties since, like their 'brothers' they are in charge of (49) ancestral shrines.

49

Compared to many patrilineal tribes, the Bemba women have a high status: parents welcome the birth of girls since they bring husbands into their village and build up its strength.

Daughters become founders of new lines since the succession passes through them. When they first marry, they are under the very definite authority of their relatives, but they are at home whereas their husbands are outsiders from other villages. They have the support of their parents and may form a solid phalanx of married sisters, and they are therefore in an extremely strong position. Teknonymy is practiced and women are called by the names of their sons or daughters with the female prefix 'na'. On the birth of the first grandchild their name is changed to grandmother of so-and-so.

There are massive contradictions between the male and submissive son-in-law - menfolk are dominant, women used to greet men kneeling, men recieve the best of food and take precedence at beer drinks and on other occassions. finds expression and resolution in the chisungu.

# The Ceremony

## THE RITUAL TYPE

52

Puberty ritual among the Bantu people can be divided into the following types:

* Puberty ritual proper - ... ritual acts which take place immediately after the first signs of physical puberty have appeared ... they appear to be designed to give magic protection to both the adolescent and his or her family, from the magic danger associated with the physiological change ... such ritual acts occur in cultures in which the fear of puberty is more pronounced...

* Nubility ritual and fertility cults - such ceremonies seem to be limited to girls ... only concerned with the first marriage of a girl, and are believed to provide protection against the magic dangers associated with the first act of intercourse in legal wedlock.

53

Nubility rites invariably include fertility magic of one sort or another, but Bantu societies also provide examples of group rites for adolescent girls and boys which follow puberty, or are associated with it. These appear to be fertility cults carried out for the whole tribe, as well as a preparation for individual marriages.

* Puberty rituals associated with initiation into age grades - these are mainly group rites for boys or girls and vary between ceremonies designed to initiate boys into an adult status, and those which mark the entry to the lowest rank of an elaborate system of age grades. 

Such ceremonies may be limited to boys alone or they may provide for parallel initiation for boys and girls.

* Puberty ritual linked with the joining of special associations. Here the adolescent joins, not only an age grade, but a secret society with special magical functions and social privileges.

Admission to the society is usually limited to certain sections of the community and entry is often purchased as a privilege rather than than required as a duty.

54

* Maturation rites disassociated with puberty - the complete separation of puberty rites proper from those of social maturation is seen in those societies where the one is followed by the other.

The Bemba Chisungu is an individual nubility rite practised for each girl ... when a girl knows that her first period has come she tells older women and they must 'bring her to the hearth' again or 'show her the fire' since her condition has made her 'cold.'

This ceremony is one in which doctored seeds are cooked on a fire and the girl must pull them out and eat them burning hot. Another might have her washed with medicine cooked in a special pot and she drinks this medicine too. She is then isolated indoors for a day or more and fed with a small ball of millet porridge cooked in new fire so that she may be made free to eat again without harming herself or others.

This is the usual Bemba way of returning to the community a person who has passed through an unusual or dangerous state.

The girl then waits till it is convenient for her chisungu ceremony to be danced - a nubility rite since it is ... a preliminary to the marriage ceremony.

55

The actual ceremony is below:

The author:
1. Saw over eighteen separate ceremonies
2. Over forty different pottery emblems
3. The walls of the hut were painted with nine different designs on the occasion in question

56
## THE ACTORS IN THE CEREMONY

Plans for a chisungu ceremony are initiated by the parents of a single girl or by two or three sets of parents whose daughters reach puberty at roughly the same time. These parents provide beer and food for the ceremony with the aid of the parents of the girls' betrothed.

The man who provides for a ceremony is known as the mwine. A chief will commonly provide for the chisungu of a young wife betrothed to him before puberty.

57

The mistress of the ceremonies (nacimbusa) organizes the rites, leads the dances and songs, and arranges for the making of the pottery and other emblems required ... it is a work that demands a detailed knowledge of ritual, industry in carrying through long and even arduous tasks, organizing ability, tact and personality. A successful nacimbusa probably has unusual intellectual ability as well as leadership and the power to attract women from surrounding villages to attend a ceremony and to keep a body of helps alert and interested for some weeks.

The banacimbusa are treated with great consideration by other women in the community.

58

The nacimbusa stands in a special relationship to the girl she has initiated throughout her life ... probably deliver the girl's first child and act as mbosua, or special guardian, to the baby.

The messenger - the nacimbusa was assisted by a woman known as the nakalamba, who was then employed to invite the guests to the ceremony by rolling on the ground in front of their houses - the BEmba form of obeisance to a chief.

The candidates and their bridegrooms - the initiation candidate is known as the nacisungu ... it was possible to carry out rites in the case of a girl who was not yet officiated. The bridegroom of a betrothed girl takes place in certain of the ceremonies under the title of shibwinga ...

The relatives - ... the girl's mother is responsible for providing food and beer, and her father's sister is believed to have a special influence over the fertility of her parental niece and to stand in a special relationship to her.

The character of the rite - ... involving much dancing and singing ... drums are beaten inside the initiation hut ... the singing is accompanied ... by the beat of the drums and clapping of hands.

59

Dancing among the Bemba is done for amusement, but it may also be done 'for respect'. Commoners will dance for their chief: a young man will dance for an older woman or man ... in such dances of respect it is common for the soloist to dance in front of the person he wants to honour, and to sing definitely to him or her.

The term 'sacred emblem' is used throughout ... translate[d from] a Bemba word, mbusa, which means 'things handed down' ... they are of three types.

The first of these are the pottery emblems ... representing domestic objects ... some animal or birds ... some are fertility symbols.

The second type of mbusa are the wall designs ... rough designs painted on the inside of the initiation hut at a certain stage in the ceremony.

60

The third type of emblem consists of small bundles of objects representing the domestic life of the Bemba ... essential food of the tribe.

## THE CEREMONY

62

The author notes that the "conditions were favourable":
1. She had been in the country for over a year and could speak the language fairly fluently
2. She knew the nacimbusa personally
3. She was the provider of the beer and was described as the owner
4. She had a tent in the village

However:
1. It is hardly possible for one field worker to get all the info
2. There is a difficulty of taking photographs and simultaneously writing notes
3. There is the factor of exhaustion
4. The author was obliged to leave before the follow-up ... and had little time to get subsequent comment from other sections of the community.

A striking gap of this - the absence of any comments made by the girls themselves.

63
### FIRST DAY (mostly paraphrased)

1. The headman spat into the air and called on the names of his ancestors.

##### The entry into the hut

1. At four in the afternoon, the village drums beat: she was called into the hut.

64

2. It had been cleared of furniture, and water pots being bubbled. The two girls appeared covered in blankets and crawling on all fours backwards under the guidance of some of the younger helpers.

When asked why they were doing this, someone said "Oh! Just to make the girls look stupid, just to make us laugh."

3. There was a hierarchy of the elders - Nangoshye squatted on her toes with her knees bent and jogged to the drums. She picked up in her mouth two small enamel bowls that covered baskets of seeds. Picking up one of her baskets ... she offered it to the oldest women ... in turn, started jogging up and down ...

When asked, someone said "We are honouring the great ones, these are the big banacimbusa from the district."

65

4. Then followed a series of solo dances from the old women.

5. Then the girls still covered by blankets sat down by the mufungo tree and began pulling leaves with her mouth. Then she made the girl crouch against the stem of the tree while the women built a sort of windscreen of branches around them.

When asked, "They are hiding them from the young girls and children."

6. Then, shouting of new directions - each women snatched at a mufungo bush for leaves ... folded into cones to resemble the small conical fish traps used by the Bemba. They sang.

When asked, "It is a parable ... the fish has many children and so will the girl. It represents the organ of a man."

7. More shouted orders and the piled-up branches were snatched away from round the girls as they cowered at the foot of the tree.

66

8. More jumps and the piled-up branches were snatched away from round the girl.
9. They were told to jump over the heap of branches.
10. Once done, they rubbed redcam wood on the faces of shoulders of the older women. 

"The chisungu has fallen off ... the red power is the blood."

11. They broke into another song.
12. Three wrinkled women rolled flat on their backs in the salute given to a chief.

"They did it to give honour."

13. Nangoshye shouted to tease the girls - and swung the two girls to and fro in front of the fire singing.

"It is just done to give them knowledge of the world."

67

### SECOND DAY

1. No special rites.

3. Most of the dances were comic.

68

### THIRD DAY - SIXTH DAY

1. Carrying a small pot of beer to Nangoshye and her helpers.
2. Ten to fifteen made pottery emblems.
3. They bought food. The women fell on it.

The ensuring days passed quietly with more dancing and pottery making.

70
### SEVENTH DAY

1. Summoned to the hut.
2. The banacisungu were bundled in under rags as before
3. Each was hobbled by having one foot strapped with bark rope to her thigh, so she could only hop on the remaining legs and had to be supported by an older woman.

"We are doing that just to tease the girls."

4. Outside the village ... girls had to walk naked except for a cloth around the waist.
5. Everyone stopped by a large musuku tree.
6. Nangoshye and her younger helpers hopped around the trunk of a tree like frogs followed up by the banacisungu.

"O, you wild pig, come and hoe up the rough grass."

"Because the pigs root up the ground." 
"It is to train the girl to hoe." 
"It is to teach her to work hard now she is married."

71

7. They did another dance representing the guinea-fowl
8. The women pretended to churn up the ground with their feet and sang calling for the birds to come

"The guinea-fowl scratches up the soil ... if a girl idles and they scold her, then she remembers the teaching of the chisungu."

9. The main actors pretend to sow seeds they had bought.

"It is just to teach the girl how to garden."

10. Picked up the maize cob with her mouth and gave it to the girls to bite.

Interpretations were mixed - girls must learn to do impossible things, must get firewood, must ignore adultery and so on.

72

11. The cob was tied with creepers to a branch of the tree
12. A girl climbed up and tied the maize cob to a high bough.
13. The banacisungu had to try to climb up.

"The girls are to imitate monkeys because the monkeys eat everything on the trees." 
"The monkey is always stealing. A good wife must try to find food for her family whenever she can."

14. Then, they blessed the musuku tree.
15. Girls were made to bite off small rings of white beads tied around twigs, offering it to the elder banacimbusa.

"The girls are to get firewood always now."
"It is to honour the musuku tree. If we did not do this there would be no parenthood for the girl."
"The musuku is a tree that bears much fruit."

16. Then came the first singing of the song, "The arm-pit can never be higher than the shoulder."

73

17. Bundles of domestic emblems were now made up.
18. There followed a number of songs.
19. The girls were brought down from the tree and with five or six of the younger helpers they were told to lead a round dance.

20. Back to the villege.
21. Two women dashed with toy bows and arrows and saplings and red powder.
22. They are sisters of the bridegrooms.
23. They carried male symbols and imitated the bride grooms.

74

24. They formed a triumphant procession.
25. Two girls were made to crawl single file with some of their companions.

26. The procession wound until they reached teh hosue of one of the girl's mothers.
27. The banacisungu were told to lie down and to put their heads first on a bunch of sorghum and then on some clusters of finger millet.

75
 
28. The mock bridegrooms appeared preten to be lame old men.

29. We then turned to the chisungu hut where another type of mbusa had been hidden in the hut roof.

30. We crowded into the hut in which the fire had been extinguished.
31. Two large water pots were set on the floor

76

32. Into each was put little darting water insects known as njelela.
33. The girls were encouraged to catch it.

"They try to find out if the girls have grown up."
"If the girl doesn't catch the njelela the women all know ... she has not yet acquired mano ... and the mother has to pay a forfeit"


34. Two large winnowing baskets were then brought in and filled with ground nuts, peas, beans.
35. One had a small basin with a collection of miscellaneous objects in it.
36. These were described as mbusa.
37. The mbusa were looked for, found, picked with the mouth, sung.

## The Interpretation of the Ceremony

112

The author identifies a number of different approaches to interpreting a complex ceremony.

1st, the **expressed purpose (primary)**:
His first step obviously is to ask the performers what they think they are achieving by their ritual behaviour and to summarise as accurately as possible the different views of the members of the community on these points.

113

It is obvious that a complete interpretation of every act in a ceremony is unlikely to be given by the whole community or even by the ritual experts in it. The nature of ritual ... demands that there should be multiple explanations for most of the forms of symbolic behaviour which composes it ... there is always some purpose, however general, behind a ceremony which the performers can, and will express.

Primary purposes of this kind may be single or multiple.

Expressed or formulated purposes can be derived from an analysis of statements of dogma known to the whole community or to its ritual specialists; from comments and explanations ... casual remarks.

114

2nd, the **expressed purposes  (secondary)**:
Expressed purposes may also include secondary as well as primary motives. For instance people may say that their object in doing such and usch acts is to give their daughter in marriage but they also may recognize that the ceremony itself gives them prestige, binds their relatives to return them economic services, or raises their credit in the community.

115

3rd, the **deduced purposes.**
Beliefs and objectives can also be deduced from indirect evidence. We may be able to deduce the importance of a symbolic act or the nature of the performer's emotional reaction to it - their interest, tension or boredom, for instance ...

Another metyhod is to analyse different texts describing the rites in hope of finding some common stress or revelation of interest. It may be possible to make some kind of statistical estimate of the recurrence of particular symbolic acts; or the reptition of statements of beliefs. Ceremonies which the performers absolutely refuse to leave out can reasonably be assumed to have more significance than those that are slurred over or omitted.

Lastly, the meaning of a viral act may perhaps be deduced by an analysis of other ceremonies performed by the same community in which an identifcal or similar act occurs.

The anthropologists' interpretations of religion and magic are naturally based largely on sociological concepts, and they tend to emphasize the function of ritual in maintaining a particular institution.

116

The following types of explanations of ritual behaviours are commonly offered:
* In relation to the common norms and values of a given tribe and its notion of casuality. Thus a ritual in connection with a particular institution can very well be examined in relation to the ethical codes and laws governing that institution, the social group involved and the activities it carries out.

The most commonly accepted view of the sociological function of ritual is that this type of religious behaviour expresses, make public, reinforces, or teaches tribal norms.

This view is epitomised in [[Radcliffe-Brown]]'s statement that a society exists because it is united by common social sentiments and that these sentiments must be constantly maintained at a given intensity. It follows that in the case of a given institution the anthropologist should ask how far the values and beliefs ... are actually expresseed or smybolized in their rites.

117

But anthropologists also tend to see the values of the tribe as forming some kind of system, whatever inconsistencies and contradictions there may be.

Similar explanations of the function of ritual are those which state that religious ceremonies exist to promote the social cohesion of the group. The emphasis is not on any particular instiution in a society or on a set of values ... but on the importance of maintaining some feeling of unity in a group.

Such explanationso of the function of ritual are those which state ... that religious ceremonies exist to promote the [[Explaining Stability and Change|social cohesion of the group]]. The emphasis here is not on any particular institution in a society or on a set of values rooted in its political, economic or domestic activities but on the importance of maintaining some feeling of unity in a group.

Such types of explanation followed closely on [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'s stimulating and vivid reconstruction of what he imagined a totemic ceremony to be among some of the Australian Aborigines and the function such a rite may perform in promoting group consciousness or the individual sense of becoming party of a larger whole.

118

For such hypotheses there is rarely any possible verification ... However, anthropologists have shown a tendency to argue that a group experiences intensified loyalty because it has attended a ceremony, and that the ceremony exists because the group has such strong feelings that it insists on holding one - a circular argument.

Later, the emphasis on religion as an expression of group cohesion led some anthropologists to explain ritual as a symbolic representation of social tensions as well as of social harmony.

Here the anthropologists has relied heavily on the psychoanalytical hypotheses.

119

All these conjectures cannot be proved until we have far more complete data from different areas. 

Lastly, ritual may have a number of practical effects which are not at all intended by the performers and of which they or the majority of them are not aware.

The author cites the examples of [[Malinowksi]]'s pointing out that the gardening ride among the Trobriand islanders serves to organize ... the different stages of their agricultural work, [[Firth]] says that seasonal taboos of bird snaring among the Maori ... give protection to the birds during breeding season. The Bemba themselves say that they wait for the blessings of their chief before cutting their gardens because they believe that otherwise they would lack the goodwill of their ancestral spirits.

The European observer ... regards this ceremony as a useful device for securing that the gardens are cut at an advantageous time of year from the point of view of weather and temperature.

120

In a sense all the types of anthropological interpretations just listed can be described as pragmatic since they are based on the argument that people carry out religious rites because they fulfil some function for the individual.


## EXPRESSED PURPOSES OF THE CHISUNGU

#### *Primary*

When questions directly as to why they need to dance the Chisungu ... most older Bemba speak with the utmost energy. It is quite clear that the rite is intended to do something, and to do something that is felt to be most necessary and important.

... They (the men) lay emphasis on the preparation of the girl for marriage and for a change of status. Men know the magic dangers to which a girl becomes a subject at puberty, but it would not be proper for them to express them.

121

Women are prepared to be much more specific. Their answers did not refer to the marriage but to the transformation of the young girl.

Their replies could be divided into three types which reflect three aspects of the rite in Bemba eyes. The chisungu is danced, they say, to make the girl grow; to teach her; and 'to make her a woman as we are.'

The first object has the clarity of the typical magic intention. It is a rite designed to change the course of nature by supernatural means.

The second is described as 'teaching', with the use of the word commonly now employed for teaching in European schools ... this form of teaching is also a type of ritual behaviour, possibly with magic intent.

The third purpose was expressed with greater vagueness and was one concerning which attitudes had to be mainly deduced.

a) *The magic and growth of nubility*

In other words, "We do the rite to grow the girl."

It is used primarily of the jumping test ... the ritual separation of the girls was clearly makrked. They slept in a separate hhut and were never seen during the day unless actually participating in a ceremony. They concealed themselves very effectively, but they were also ritually hidden. They entered the initiation hut on the first day under the cover of blankets and they remained hidden in this way until the third day when they returned from the first woodland ceremony.

122

Social isolation was also marked by abstention from the usual habits of life. The girls wore old and shabby cloths tied round their waists. They were three times rebuked for tying their cloths above their breasts in the ordinary fashion of Bemba women. Their food was cooked on a separate fire. They were not allowed to wash or shav.

Such symbolic acts of separation occur in other forms of Bemba ritual when a change of social role has taken place, such as in the marriage ceremony proper or the rite of installation of a chief.

The characteristic element here is the number of stages the girl has to pass, and also the emphasis on the difficulty, not only of the new wife, but of the tests of maturity the girl has to pass.

These are rites of role assumption, but is there not also an element of test, or actually of ordeal, in the magic sense of the word? It is difficult to say whether the symbolic acts of separation and rejoining the community are though to cause social maturation and can thus be ranked as magic of growth ... signs of the readiness of the candidate for such changes ... signs that the change has successfully occurred.

123

The author points to the reaction of the girls failing to jump - "Nothing, but it is very good if she does. Anyhow she must jump it. We do not let them fail."

An analysis of the song interpretations also show the strong emphasis that is placed throughout the rite on the duty of the girl to do difficult and unprecedented things.

[[Van Gennep]] has stressed the significance of puberty ritual as the expression of a change of status ... but I believe that it will be found that many of the tests of endurance in initiation ceremonies, like 'the teasing of the girls' ... are not only signs of ritual submission to authority and payments made for the receipt of magical protection but also are forms of ordeal or oracle magic. In other words, they reflect the anxiety of parents and relatives as to whether the candiadates really are grown up or socially fit for married life.

Ukukushya is also the word used for the rites designed to protect the girl from the dangers associated with the physical onset of puberty and to make it possible for her to have safe intercourse with her husband and a safe delivery from of her child.

124

It is difficult to separate this aspect of the ceremony from the other acts that compose it since the whole chisungu is thought to contribute to this end, but the theme of the removal of danger is seen in a number of isolated songs and mimes. In one of the first songs, the danger is described as a stone that falls off the girls. The menstrual blood is represented throughout by the colour red on pottery emblems and house designs.

The blood is removed by whitening ... the girls themselves are painted white like the egret and they are likened to beautiful white birds.

The girls and their families (after jumping over the faggots) the girls and their families have done something fearful and they have succeeded. They have been through danger and have escaped. The culture teaches terror of menstrual blood. The chisungu provides the means of safety. It is a magic form of protection which can only be secured ... by carrying out prescribed acts and by penalites or dues to those in possession of the secret, in this case the nacimbusa.

The magic of fertility is also clearly another of the elements in the chisungu ritual. The whole ceremony makes the girl nubile and thus potentially fertile.

...

125

The ritual lighting of the girl's fire by the father's sister was described as 'begging for parenthood.'

It is difficult to be certain how far human fertility is associated with agricultural fertility in these rites. I was nevere specifically told that the garden mimes were done to make the gardens yield, but merely to 'teach the girls to garden', but it would certainly be hard to distinguish very clearly between the productivity of the girls and the productivity of the seeds they sow in rites.

To conclude, I believe the women in charge of the ceremony were convinced that they were causing supernatural changes to take place in the girls under their care, as well as marking those changes. They were changing an alarming position to a ssafe one, and securing the transition from a calm but unproductive girlhood to a potentially dangerous but fertile womanhood.

*b) the teaching of the girls (ukufunda).*

(The Bemba women} say with great emphasis and characteristic repetition "We teach and teach and teach the girls" and they sometimes add "We make them clever" using the causative form of the verb "to be intelligent and socially competent and to have a knowledge of etiquette."

126

I doubt whether any direct instruction took place...

If any useful information was handed out during the chisungu one would be inclined to think the candidates themselves would be the last people to have a chance of acquiring it.

But instruction ... was quite unnecessary in such subjects. Bemba girls play at cooking as sooon as hey can stand, and they help their mothers in the house most of the day. They go with the older women to garden and also learn from them how to look for mushrooms and wild spinaches. Moreover, the more complex aspects of housekeeping... are not entrusted to the girl until some years after marriage.

127

What then do the Bemba girls learn in their chisungu or in what sense can they be said to learn?

First of all they learn a secret language ... the different mbusa have names, at any rate, known only to initiated women.

Girls are also said to learn the scret language of marriage. The bemba language abounds ... with hidden or allusive meaning. It is part and parcel of court etiquette and it is used in other special social relations and in particular between husband and wife.

The intimacy that surrounds the physical relation of husband and wife, described as 'the secret things within the house' seems to be European to be curious in view of the lack of other forms of intimate companionship between them, but it is evident that it is the special phraseology and taboos of married life that a man hopes his wife will learn in the chisungu. The candidates also have to learn the rather complex sequences of the rites themselves which represents a considerable effort of memory in communities without a written language.

128

A girl may have little intellectual understanding of what is being done at the time of her chisungu, although she may be in a highly emotional state in which she is likely to be suggestible to the general emphasis laid on the importance of marriage and childbirth.

Secondly the chisungu teaches ... the socially approved attidues [towards the technical activities of wife, mother and housewife].

When she [a young girl] is grown up and married, she cannot refuse her duties or it will be a cause of divorce ... in other words, the girl is told that she has to do things with a new spirit and a new sense of responsibility.

129

It seems likely therefore that these rites are the means by which the girl publicaly accepts her new legal role. These are the obligations handed mimed in the chisungu ceremony, such as the proper submission of her girl to her husband; the distribution of food to the family; and the exchange of gifts.

It is difficult ... to draw ... fast lines between mimetic rites designed to produce a result ... rites which represent behaviour associated with a social role ... rites by which the individual publicly proclaims that she is ready to accept a role which will afterwards be enforced by legal penalties.

The author uses several terms: magic rites, representative rites and rites of role assumptions.

130

*The chisungu as a rite of status change.*

Is there any evidence that the rites are definitely considered as a means of admitting the chisungu candidates to a new social group such as an age grade?

There is no evidence that even in the former days girls who had been danced were clearly distinguished in terms of clothing from those who had not.

Linguistically too, there is no distinct terminology describing a formal age grade. The term mukashyana is used for a young girl just before marriage and just after, and as we saw, the occupations of the two are very similar. Marriage does not bring an independent status of the word.

Nevertheless the girl does acquire new relationships through her chisungu and submits herself to new authorities. It goes without saying that she is in a somewhat different position with regard to her affinial relatives since the ceremony is the first of a series of rites which mark the gradual consolidation of the marriage relationship.

131

The girl also assumes a position in an informal group composed of the women of the neighbourhood. The chisungu candidate of one year works the following year for the same nacimbusa and joins the ranks of her younger helpers.

Within this loose neighbourhood group the older women are honoured ... as a number of persons arranged in an exact order of precedence. This hiearchy of age and fame is constantly expressed in the ceremony. "The arm-pit is not higher than the shoulder"

132

The position of the senior women in the chisungu also reflects their activities in everyday life. The nacimbusa is the midwife. She attends the childbed of the girls she has 'danced' ... provides the magic which will enable them to come safely through the ordeal. She divines to find out which ancestral spirit is being born ... listens to confessions of adultery.

The mistress of the ceremonies often becomes the protector ... the god mother of the child.

It is because the girl has been danced and is magically changed; because she has been 'taught' and has assumed a position in a hierachy of women and has the protection of the nacimbusa of her district that she is no longer a weed, a piece of rubbish or an unfired pot.

*Secondary motives*

The Bemba no doubt have a number of motives.

The chisungu is an occasion for entertainment and the meeting of friends and relatives.

Women in fact speak of some of the rites as 'just playing.'

A number of Bemba seem ... to realize that the Chisungu is an occasion for the display of social status.

At the ceremony ... Nangoshye constantly complained that she was being insulted by the meanfare cooked for her.

This is a society in which the ceremonial expression of kinship obligations is important ... so it is not unexpected that women should give importance to the chisungu as a centre of attraction for kinsmen.

It is probable that much of the six months or so formerly given to the ceremony was devoted to these ends. The dances provide an opportunity for expressing respect for status, so the nacimbusa employes the magic of attraction to make people come to her ceremony.

134

Present-day differences of income have added to the prestige. A man of substance wants his daughter's chisungu to be talked about.

A really successful chisungu is difficult to carry out under modern conditions ... no large sums of money are exchanged.

It is ... organized entirely by women, and male dominance is emphasised in a modern wage-earning society.

### DEDUCED ATTITUDES.

page 135

Bemba descriptions of the chisungu ... differ in a striking way from the account I have given.

page 136

None of the accounts mention the gardening mimes or the teasing of the girls. It is difficult to say whether the informants gave the selected events because they were the least secret, or because they felt they would be less likely to shock Europeans ... have curious and unaccountable ideas about anything to do with sex.

137

European accounts ... emphasize the obscentity of the tribe or else its educational function..

To conclude, Bemba accoutns given casually to an anthropologist emphasize the dramatic and public acts such as the final ritual jumps over the hoop and the bow and arrow ceremony ... they also stress the exchange of food and beer and the feasts.

They omit ... the secret aspects, the lighting of the girl's fire, her purification and whitening and the pottery figures and other mbusa used.

138

it was indeed the anxiety of the company showed on these occasions [magical omens - jumping over faggots] that first led me to think the chisungu was both a rite of passage and a magic ordeal.

I rarely had the feeling of the 'sacred' during these ceremonies in the woodland.

139

There was a lot of joking and talking ... it was plain that these were not spontaneous emotions.

The teasing of the girls was apparently considered to be a duty rather than a pleasurable excitement.

The rites were everywhere shortened in 1931 and 1933 when I was in the country. In many places they were not performed at all.

### THE CHINSUNGU IN RELATION TO TRIBAL DOGMA AND VALUES

140

[The Chisungu] expresses marriage morality - the girl's submission to her husband and his duty to provide for her, and the domestic, agricultural and sexual obligations of both.

(Paraphrased) The first important ritual is the ceremony surrounding chieftainship - royal burial, so on, the second is the series of economic rites and the third the chisungu ceremonies themselves.

The ritual pattern in all these ceremonies is based on a essentially homogenous body of beliefs - ... the dogma which links authority with the exercise of supernatural power based on access to ancestral spirits by those who have correctly handled sex and fire.

146

It is the occasion on which the girl is given her fire and her marriage pot and made responsible for their care and their use ... a glance at the ceremonies in the last column will show that except for individual magic rites, there are no ceremonies in the last common which od not, in the last resource, depend on the chisungu or on the abbreviated forms of puberty ceremony now carried out instead.

The chisungu can also be considered of importance to the maintenance of tribal traditions because of its direct emphasis on 'things handed down'.

147

In the chinsungu however the women do not voice new desires but always those that have existed in the past.

The rites consist of an intricate succession of acts the value of which lies in more or less exact repetition. The mbusa must be made in the same way and the pottery models on the floor cannot be established ... represent and proclaim the established rather than ones which enable the performer to meet new needs.

(To the chart) it will be seen that all the major rituals of the Bemba reflect the importance they attach to fertility and the supply of food. 

148

Bemba believe that the child is entirely formed from the physical contribution of the mother and not the father.

It is moreover common to find in primitive society that the woman is rgarded as solely responsible for the failure of a couple to produce children ... the children of a marriage belong legally to the girl's family and it is to their gain if she produces children.

The salient features ... are also reflected in this ritual:
* The characteristic attitudes to authority in this hierarchical society are expressed in ceremonies by which chiefs are created and maintained in their supernatural powers.
* The hierarchy based on age ... (149) is one of those which is frequently symbolised in the chisungu by the offering of food in order of age; by acts of obeisance to seniors; by the singing over and over again of the song about the immutability of precedence based on age.
* There is a great expression of the principle of precedence by age in the chisungu than in the chiefly rites themselves. This may be due to the fact that all rites of role assumption naturally give importance to age since it is those who have already assumed the senior role who can hand it on to the juniors.

149

It is worth noting that there is very little ritual expression of clan or lineage unity.

The principle of matrilineal descent is very strongly held here in spite of the domestic authority the father manages to win.

The boy himself is making an individual contract with all his wife's relatives. The girl's father and mother and the father's sisters are the main actors in the ceremony and the father is the potential head of the extended family ...

In the chisungu ... it is the family that is emphasized and not the lineage. It must be recalled that the Bemba boy provides his own small token payments at marriage.

...

It seems clear that the maintenance of a stable family group is a difficult matter among the Bemba. There is the desire of the girl to stay with her own people which is opposed to that of the boy who wishes to return to his: accounting for the chisungu ritual which stresses the link between husband and wife; the supernatural sanctions against adultery; and the constant admonishment of the girl to submit to her husband.

To conclude, Bemba chieftainship express a number of beliefs that are common to the chisungu such as the sex-fire-blood association and the link between political authority and ancestors.

151

They combine to stress the importance of fertility, children, food, respect for authority based on descent and age, and the need to build up village communities.

Religion and magic ceremonies tend to be associated with:
1. Natural environment
2. Economic activities
3. Biological processes

Social structure:
1. Maturation rites of assumption (of age rates or entry to age grades)

Chisungu is a rite of social maturation and role assumption, employing magic of growth and tests of social maturation

2. Social relationships

Chisungu contracts marriage relationships: expresses rights of father, mother and father's sisters; expresses the relationships of brother and sister; expounds the ethical rules of kinship.

3. Social groups
Chisungu expresses precedence based in age and authority in the women's groups.

4. Ultimate beliefs and dogma

The chisungu is a form of puberty ritual ... it has a double focus since it is made to represent the attainment of sexual and social maturity alike.

A summary classification of ritual practices ... shows ... they are used to control what is uncontrollable by rational means.

153

That control is secured according to the people's belief either by supplication.

Secondly, they are used to maintain systems of social relationships and the structure of groups.

Thirdly, they may provide the individual with spiritual experiences and represent the tribal philosophy or view of the world.

### UNCONSCIOUS TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS

154

There is a contradiction ... between the concentration of fears around the beginning of married life and the open pleasure in sex relations which Bemba express. Puberty is eagerly looked forward to by the girls. They and their parents watch the growth of their breasts with interest and excitement ... they do not seem to fear the first act of intercourse.

155

In spite of this, intercourse is thought to be dangerous. Moreover, it is the act with the marriage bond that is feared, not the act outside it.

It is difficult to believe that the Bemba associate guilt with sex in marriage ... it is at least possible that sex is considered shameful in association with a man's ancestors who are ... his maternal uncles and grandfathers ... there may thus be an extension to the spirit world of attitudes to living relatives.

The taboos may also reflect the anxieties associated with marriage in Bemba society ... a frail link on which to depend for an approach to supernatural power. 

156

However strong the fears of the Bemba are, the way of escape from them is easy. The correct observance for ritual rules and reliance on the elders is sufficient.

It is curious that the Bemba, whose marriages are trial marriages in their early stages, should express such a strong belief in the mystic links uniting husband and wife in the chisungu ceremony. Yet the Bemba are firmly convinced that the conduct of each partner to a marriage has a magical effect on the health of the other, and even on that of a third party, who commits adultery with one or another.

157

One could interpret this requirement by saying that the spirit of a dead Bemba is thought to haunt the living if the departed man or woman has been defrauded of his or her rights. If this interpretation is correct it can be assumed that a man who sleeps with the widow before the necessary ceremony of 'taking off the death' has taken place is regarded as defrauding the dead man of the marital rights he had acquired.

Because of the lack of durable property in which status can be expressed, there is a tremendous insistence upon points of precedence and honour, and fights over what seem to us to be trivial claims and dues.

His sexual rights over the wife is never questioned.

158

Another paradox is the contrast between the position of the bridegroom in daily life, and the role he is depicted in the chinsugi.

In village affairs he must be submissive
In the chisungu he appears as a roaring lion, a lion-killer.
The bride's family is indebted to the bridegroom for 'the gift of a child'. In the chisungu rite it is the bridegroom's sister who 'begs for parent-hood'

159

If a Bemba husband fails to give his wife a child, his marriage dies.
If he makes her pregnant but she dies in childbirth, he is held responsible.
If he succeeds, he 'finds a house' and acquires status but rights of approach to his own matrilineal ancestors.

The honouring of the son-in-law in the chisungu also enacts the desire of the womenfolk to attract a young man to make his home in their village. Bemba girls are bought up in a male dominated society ... but they [women] deny him ultimate power over his children.

160

To conclude, Bemba evidence supports the suggestion that there is a connection between matriliny and girls' initiation ceremonies which emphasize the importance of fertility.

161

### PRAGMATIC EFFECTS

(Trying something new, paraphrased from now on)

The intentions must be distinguished from the actual effects:


The marked stage.
The Bemba girl are nervous, series of ceremonial acts give her assurance and providing proof that she has a new stage in life ... free to eat loads

If the marked stage is a ritual device the device of omen is more widely associated than previously thought.

The chisungu is a test in the eyes of the performer.

The device of public pronouncement is important - means of which the girl gains confidence that she is now able to act on her own, the first time she has been able to announce her individual responsibility in any way.

Another device, the sacred emblem.
The ritual pattern is common in ceremonies passing on roles and values.
A series of ideas are associated with symbols.
It is evident that the designs and pottery emblems form a sort of aide-memoire, women started to hum the songs when they saw the mbusa.
It is clear that figurines represent moral attitudes and obligations, shoutable in a quotable form.
(Example - woman tries to leave her baby to get a drink, older woman shotus the song).
Therefore, this becomes a formal expression to public morality.

It is also fixed form - centre of cluster of different associations. But, they are handed down - things will go on as they did before.
They are used as basis of 'charter maintenance'.

It does not matter how many meanings an emblem has,, only that the performers believe it was always the same. At the very least it conveys conventional attitudes.

There is double meaning in every symbol - hoe represents garden duties (wife) but male fertility, miming dances around the musuku trees to honour it and to test women into parenthood, but also a reference to duty to get firewood. Girl emblems tied to trees and handled with mouths: tree that bears much fruit and symbolizes fertility, used for firewood, ancestors blessing (honouring with spittle). The mime - woman ready to do impossible tasks, like the silent tortoise, but not like the tortoise in that he does not tell guests he has supply of food.

All of these symbols acquire secret meanings in ceremonies that only become revealed once partaken.

Also, it has a number of effects on tribal institutions and structure - a mechanism of the cult group.

Complex symbolism does not survive in a society without written literature.

167

The chisungu puts power into the hands of the nacimbusa.

The ritual mechanisms used here may be elucidated by continued comparison of this cycle of rites with the ceremonies referred to.

The ritual is handed on by hereditary succession in the case of headmen.
Thus, the long rites for the burial of a Citimukulu, the installation of his successor and the building of his new village are controlled by hereditary buriers.

The chisungu is mainly carried out by commoners who have no special relation to the chief and his court. The banacimbusa are individuals who won their way into authority.

Difference too in how rites are performed - headmen pray to his ancestors when the village is quiet. The rites of great chiefs are secret and no unauthorized people can be present when the Citimukulu pray before his relic shrine.

168

Common people hope and believe the rites have been performed to there.

The main features of a chisungu are its crowds ... ancestral ceremonies are performed in a reverent and quiet way. The chisungu proclaims and teaches ... the ancestral prayers are supplications to spirits who can give and withold.

The approach is different ... only made by men in authority who believe themselves ... pure.
