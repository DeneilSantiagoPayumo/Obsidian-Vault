# Reflections on (Occupy) Everywhere, Social media, public space, and emerging logics of aggregation
## Article Introduction
### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

How is media transforming protest? How are movements organised according to media? How does it matter and what new patterns of protest are available?

### What are the key takeaways?

Logic of networking - a cultural framework that helps give rise to to practices of communication and coordination across diversity and difference on the part of collective actors, and a "logic of aggregation" which involves the assembling of masses of individuals from diverse backgrounds within physical spaces .... Social media have contributed to powerful logics of aggregation which have continued to exist alongside rather than entirely displacing logics of networking.

Foundation for future tactically diverse protest.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The rise of Occupy Everywhere and Occupy Boston

September 17 2011:
- in the wake of renewed resistance struggles.
- Anonymous spread the word, AdBusters (2011), so on...
- Grassroots, spread to Boston
- Peaceful, egalitarian, democratic
- To address imbalances in representation of historically marginalised people, we've got an informal network of labour and community based groups

### An examination of the relationship between social media and Occupy movements

Global justice movements during the late 1990s and 2000s were:

```ad-quote
title: 266
entailed a set of embodied social and cultural dispositions shaped by informational capitalism that oriented actors toward (1) **building horizontal ties and connections among diverse, autonomous elements (e.g., movements, organizations, groups, etc.)**; (2) **the free and open circulation of information; (3) collaboration via decentralized coordination and directly democratic decision making**; and (4) **self-directed networking**. A cultural logic is a **semiotic framework**—produced and reproduced through concrete practices of interpretation that are shaped by specific technological, social, and economic contexts—**through which people make sense of their world and their interactions with others**. It is a logic of action, a “**process of people collectively using effectively identical assumptions in interpreting each other's actions—i.e. hypothesizing as to each other's motivations and intentions**” ([Enfield 2000](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01362.x?saml_referrer#b28):36).

```

A cultural logic of networking is a framework for grasping the actions of others that is shaped by our interactions with others in turn gives rise to specific kinds of social and political networking practices.

On the other hand, a logic of aggregation:

```ad-quote
title: ibid
A **logic of aggregation** is an **alternative cultural framework** that is **shaped by our interactions with social media and generates particular patterns of social and political interaction** that involve the **viral flow of information and subsequent aggregations of large numbers of individuals in concrete physical spaces**. Whereas networking logics entail a praxis of communication and coordination on the part of collective actors that are already constituted—including particular organizations, networks, and coalitions (cf. [Fox 2009](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01362.x?saml_referrer#b34))—logics of aggregation involve the **coming together of actors qua individuals**. These individuals may subsequently **forge a collective subjectivity through the process of struggle**, but it is a subjectivity that is under the **constant pressure of disaggregation** into its individual components—hence, the importance of interaction and community building within physical spaces. Whereas networks are also given to fragmentation, the collective actors that compose them are more lasting ([Fox 2009](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01362.x?saml_referrer#b34); [Juris 2008a](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01362.x?saml_referrer#b53)).

```

A logic of networking or aggregation is not so much an interpretative framework to an organising strategy and political model.

Listservs helped give rise to a model of network organisation based on decentralized coordination among diverse actors - structures outliving the mobilization for which they are created. 

Social media also helps to get people to gain large numbers of individuals to converge in protest rather than generating organizational networks, these tools helping to stitch together interpersonal networks.

### The intersections between virtual and physical protest

Diversity of tactics - networking logics inscribed into urban spaces as alternative networks, mass global justice actions were temporary performative terrains in which networks made themselves and their struggles visible.

Physical protest and logic of aggregation - visible crowds of individuals aggregated within concrete locales.

```ad-quote
title: 268
This dynamic produces a powerful incentive for politically motivated crowds of aggregated individuals—in the case of #Occupy, motivated to address grievances such as rising inequality, unemployment, and increasing corporate influence over electoral politics—to come together to maintain a physical presence in public places, even as they continue to inhabit online worlds of social networking. The logics of aggregation associated with #Occupy meant that, at least initially, it was widely perceived, by participants and observers alike, as coterminous with public occupations as its primary tactical expression—hence, the powerful impetus to continue occupying regardless of the shifting circumstances.
```

Occupiers: vital importance of space, appropriating urban spaces, challenging the transformation of social space into abstract space under calculus of exchange value that drives neoliberal capitalism.

```ad-quote
title: ibid
The best way to understand the powerful drive to keep the physical occupations going, I argue, is to recognize that participants have largely related to the occupations not merely as a tactic but, rather, as the physical and communal embodiments of the virtual crowds of individuals aggregated through the viral flows of social media. As an occupier suggested during an emergency #Occupy Boston assembly to discuss an impending police raid on the evening of October 10, if the occupation were evicted, “we can always go back to the organizations that have long been struggling in our communities.” Not that this was a bad idea, but given the lack of a publicly expressed alternative, such as finding other strategies to keep Occupy Boston going, it did seem to indicate what I observed as a widespread reluctance at the time to imagine the Occupy movements beyond the physical occupations. The benefit, then, of the evictions was that they forced occupiers to develop new strategic and tactical repertoires that may establish the conditions of possibility for the development of a potentially more diverse, flexible, and sustainable struggle. The challenge now, in my view, and as expressed by many Occupy Boston participants, is to find alternative ways of occupying space beyond the centralized encampments while also finding innovative strategies for achieving public visibility.

### Relationship between logics of networking and logic of aggregation during the post eviction phase of occupy. 

```ad-quote
title: 271
Indeed, despite the shift toward decentralized networking, a logic of aggregation remains strong, as evidenced by the proliferation of smaller #Occupy assemblies and meetings and ongoing calls from many quarters to find new spaces for large-scale physical occupations, including other parks, abandoned buildings, closed schoolhouses, or foreclosed homes. At one posteviction visioning session I attended at Encuentro Cinco, involving 30 people from various working groups, several participants talked about the importance of public space in which to gather—and in which Occupy Boston's “houseless” participants might find shelter—whether new occupations, rented storefronts, or donated union halls. Meanwhile, General Assemblies and other collective gatherings have taken place in churches and community spaces around the city, at least temporarily replacing Dewey Square as Occupy Boston's primary sites of physical aggregation and community building. What has been particularly striking in the immediate post-Dewey period has been the sheer quantity of meetings and gatherings, ranging from continued four-times-a-week assemblies to ongoing working-group meetings (often multiple meetings on any given evening), weekly communal gatherings and open houses on Monday nights, and various special planning and strategy sessions.
