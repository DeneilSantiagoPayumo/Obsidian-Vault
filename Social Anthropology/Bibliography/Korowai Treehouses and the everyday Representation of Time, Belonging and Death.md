```ad-abstract
Treehouses can be described as artwork for Korowai, in the sesne that numerous surrounding categories and principles of people's lives are poetically superimposed in sensory experience of the physical buildings. Houses represent termporality, social belonging, and fear of death. Indexical links of causation or spatiotemporal continguity are a central mode of representationn through which houses have their force.

## Introduction: What's in a House, and How is it There?

I take the categories art and aesthetic to describe human activity and cognition reflexively concerned with sensed forms and their meaningful effects, including evaluative feelings that the sensed forms are beautiful, good, or otherwise emotionally moving - these houses are artworks by virtue of the poetic density which they draw relational connections.

By 'poetic density', we reference Jakobson (1960) who describes the 'poetic function' as an aspect of speech events in which structural properties of the linguistic medium that are normally present only latently are made the focus of vivid linguistic signification themselves through dense layering and superimposition.

The importance and force of houses to Korowai rest in the way they signify a multiplicity of surrounding categories and principles in densely superimposed form.

We use two terms - iconicity and indexicality - to specify two ways. In iconic aspects, treehouses signify by felt resemblance; they are the very picture, image or quality of that which they make present. In their indexical aspects, treehouses signify by felt spatiotemporal connection: the outcome, cause or correlative - signify things in multiple ways.

## Houses as Indexical Icons of Temporality

Seeing houses, Korowai see time - the house's transient. Four thousand Korowai live across 500 square miles of lowland forest. Residents build houses at a rate of more than one a year.

Temporality is a big feature of the experience of residence: the expression *xaim-demun* 'house deterioration' is a category of time reckoning. Korowai locate events by stating how many houses fell apart.

House transiency is how people anticipate the future - people would not move back until their houses had fell.

Speakers readily mention the people with whom they shared that house. Persons live the events of their lives as the spaces where those events occurred - a network of former house sites is a memory palace of personal and social history.

They call houses with proper names, individual houses are designated by the tree species that provided the house's trunk followed by a suffix meaning 'house supported by tree of that species.'

This method of referring to a house as a historical singularity points to a main contrast with photographic imaging of treehouses - there is a strong focus on dwellings. There is a strong focus on dwellings as a type. A house by definition is a historically and socially located dwelling.

Another aspect of the time-saturated nature of dwelling is that the duration of residents' presence is visible in ceilings - rather than throwing bones away, Korowai inset them in the thatch. They suspend large bones directly over hearths where they blacken. It is so 'other people will see the prosperity' - the longer the house has been occupied, the more cluttered the ceiling grows with animal parts, and the more it blackens with soot. The sensory experience of an interior is directly indexical and iconic of the time and emotion of resident's life.

They take up houses as icons of their temporality. One shared understanding of religion is that the world's creator is a malcontent who incinerates or floods his current creation and replaces it with another. People compare their landscape with houses.

Another pattern of talk - generic reference to building houses as the prototypic activity of people's lives. They understand houses to be valuable and often seize on house-building as a defining attribute of masculinity in particular, such as when women are talking about different men's desirability as husbands.

Korowai identify the temporalities of house construction, residence, abandonment, and decay as primary qualities of a material dwelling - treehouses are artworks densely making present multiple broader context in a single object, they are time-based art. Their power is that they can draw together multiple kinds of intertemporal links such as an accumulated history of meals, biographies and social histories lived as a sequence of house occupations, and a sense of the world as being in decline.

### Treehouses as Indexical Icons of Social Relations

The directly temporal content of Korowai experience of houses illustrates a broader point that a house is defined in its materiality by the exercise of cognitive faculties - houses in their sensory features present an interpretive structure of thought ... for the Korowai, these houses represent ideas of persons acting practically toward the world and each other in places adn times.

There is a notion that being co-residents or literally 'same house people' is itself a condition of significant social unity.

People's routine allusion to shared residence as a mode of closeness are grounded in the larger experimental base of activities people do in houses and the status of houses as core media in the wider organisation of life into contrasts between spaces of belonging, security, comfort and otherwise - consider the relation between houses and human bodies.

Carsten and Hugh-Jones emphasise ways that the house and body are intimately linked - but lets pay attention to the stratification of people's lifeworlds into spaces of familiarity and spaces of otherness, a stratification lived through bodies and houses alike - bodies and houses are material footing which people engage with a wider field of other sensed form ... houses, as a kind of second body, define one spatial scene of human social activity, a broad dialectics of separating and situating.

Intertwined with a house's character as a physical vessel for making and sharing bodily welfare is a structure of conceptual boundaries defining whose house it is - the divide between house owners and non-owners is viscerally felt. Ownership is a multi-layered condition of having rights to be in a space and enjoying the place.

Social life is a matter of keeping separate to not infringe on each other's wellbeing - they link landownership to a political value of autonomy. They say that the only reason clans own territories is so people can live dispersed and avoid conflicts over food theft. Geographic dispersion and house height are for Korowai two modes of separateness summed up in the single word 'elevate house' - going together as a single idea of society.

People often speak of elevated houses is embodying a model of collective life as anger - to live high above ground and far apart is to participate in a social ethos of volatile egalitarian hypersensitivity to being impinged upon.

Houses materialise an idea of society as involvement across fraught political distance can be seen from people's sensitivity about entering them - to enter someone's house is a marked act of impingement and vulnerability, opening possibilities of mutual care across boundaries of otherness.

Linked to experience of houses as vessels of separation is association of house interiors with mutuality of being between persons who share the space. One indication of how Korowai understand domestic space is that people are careful to ensure nobody ever sleep at night alone - application of figures or temperature is to talk about whether children live there, with children called 'heavy' or 'hot' but a house without is 'light' or 'cold.'

Domestic sharing defines people as unitary. interactions between owners and guests are fraught with feelings of strain or discomfort, as well as of pleasure and mutuality - through complex etiquettes of food giving, bodily comportment and verbal reserve and expressiveness.

The internal space of the house is differentiated -  most dwellings separate men's territory and women's territory. People give three reasons: men are afraid of menstruation, mother-in-law and son-in-law pairs must avoid each other and people don't want men and women from forming sexual attraction through sight. The category 'territory, place' by which people refer to these gendered halves is the same term they designate larger expanses of land owned by clans.

### Treehouses as Indexical Icons of Life and Death

House height is significant to Korowai. Height's status as defining features of domestic space is reflect in how the verb to enter literally means 'climb'.

They associate the height of their houses with the desire to stay separate from two categories of death-imbued monsters, fear of the demon or the witches. Those who seek reunion with living territory, and those who consume people's bodies respectively.

People rub stones rubbed with fats or magical objects to stop demons and witches from ascending. They also make big clearings.

These sensory projects are relational to vivid ideas about the limits to what can be seen or kept away: perceptual experience of house space is suffused by awareness that any moment of human presence if relational to death. Sensation is informed by ideas.

The affinity between death and houses is clear in the speed in which people mention any death that occurred in a house and the practice of disposing of corpses by leaving them bound to a house's floor.

Monster imagery highlight how much the mutual belonging that unfolds within house space is coloured by consciousness of death as another time that is relationally present and negating of the time of human copresence. People move away from a death house after burying the person's body and avoid going near the house site

Monster imagery and the wider connection between dwellings and death highlight how the mutual belonging that unfolds within house space is coloured by consciousness of death as a time that is relationally present in and negating of the time of human copresence.

We can see this relationship appreciated in other practiced associations and disassociations - look at birth where a woman gives birth on the ground, the placenta and birth wastes are buried, and the mother and child spend a few days in a constructed shelter before re-joining the main households. They believe those fluids are dangerous to humans' health.

People often speak of a weakness of a social group by speaking of houses.

It is striking how Korowai take up treehouses as figures on an overall life pattern of travelling around the forest in projects of getting food - they contrast treehouse living with alternative with alternative modes of life. Korowai have to leave their houses and risk attacks whereas tourists just 'lie there'.

A treehouse therein signifies a whole array of life-sustaining activities - one of the many places where a house as spatial form is not only set against the surrounding world of less comfortable spaces as a refuge, but turned towards those spaces a base from which to venture into them.

### Conclusion: indexical links are Representation, Sensation is Figurative

This essay has only surveyed a small selection of the elements a house is relational to and yet the list has increased:
- The duration of time people lived in the house and their history of living together
- People eating together
- The difference between present moments and past times, the relation between this house and past ones
- The site of a house on an owned territory
- Mother-in-law bonds
- The idea of belonging in relation to a place
- Boundaries and bridges between house owners and their guests
- Activities of moving and working on the landscape
- The landscape's organisation as a patchwork of owned places in which people build their houses and relate outwards
- People's history of bereavement and loss, distress and fear in anticipating future deaths.

Two theories:

Aesthetic figuration occurs in indexical links between a material medium and what else it makes present. Relations of causality, use and spatiotemproal connection are a central part of the sensory experience of houses as important and moving - these indexical links intertwine with iconic ones, modes of signification transform into one another.

By existing in time and having deterioration a part of their materiality, houses become a picture of temporal duration and succession - a causal reality that is also an interpretation, an idea and a sociocultural ordering of causality itself.

The sensation itself is a matter of embodied culture and embodied ideas: sensory eprception is not a kind ofdegree zero of indexical signification, the perceiver is directly causally struck by a stimulus.
