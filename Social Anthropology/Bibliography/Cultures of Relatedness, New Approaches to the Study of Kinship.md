Cultures of Relatedness, New Approaches to the Study of Kinship

>[!summary]
>In recent years new life has been breathed into the anthropological study of kinship. This volume brings together some of the sources of the new vitality by exploring local cultures of relatedness in comparative context. The authors describe what 'being related' does for particular people living in specific localities in Africa, China, India, Madagascar, Alaska, and Europe ... they build from first principles a picture of the implications and the lived experience of relatedness in local contexts. It is a truism that people are always conscious of connections to other people. It is equally a truism that some of these connections carry particular weight - socially, materially, affectively. And, often but not always, these connections can be described in genealogical terms, but they can also be described in other ways.

>... In this introductory chapter I situate local practices in a broader comparative context. For the Inupiat, it is clear that a rejection of biology as constituting the moral bedrock to kinship does not mean that relatedness, as locally constituted, is irrelevant - on the contrary, Bodenhorn makes clear that Inupiat constantly seek to acquire more ties through naming practices, adoption, and marriage. Crucially, however, these ties are seen as optative rather than given.

## A summary of the book:

This chapter is a summary of several ideas of kinship.

First, it covers Schneider.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Schneider, American Kinship

In Schneider's view, he viewed kinship losing ground to gender - a pattern of anthropological understanding shifting from structure to practice. He called this a ""'democratisation of the intellectual enterprise' (1995: 197) in which concerns about social justice, from feminism and the civil rights movement, were crucial."" (2000: 2)

He also noted that kinship has 'risen from its ashes' which he attributed to studies of gay and lesbian kinship.

"Scheneider's *A Critique of the Study of Kinship* (1984) can be read as a commentary on his earlier monograph *American Kinship: A Cultural Account* (1980). In the first book, he outlined American kinship as a cultural system (6)

Schneider argued that sexual reproduction was a core symbol of kinship in a system which was defined by two dominant orders, that of nature, or substance, and that of law, or code. The sexual union of two unrelated partners in marriage provided the symbolic link between these two orders. It resulted in children connected to their parents through blood ties, or 'shared biogenetic substance' symbolising 'diffuse, enduring solidarity.' (6-7)

Nature is crucial in American kinship, the family is formed according to the laws of nature and it lives by rules which are regarded by Americans as self-evidently natural.

Sexual intercourse here has a critical symbolic role:
```ad-quote
"All of the significant symbols of American kinship are contained within the figure of sexual intercourse ... the figure is formulated in American culture as a biological entity and a natural act. Yet throughout, each element which is defined as natural is at the same time augmented and elaborated, built upon and informed by the rule of human reason, embodied in law and in morality." (P.40 / Schneider)

```

Franklin comments that three different 'natures' emerge from Schneider's analysis of American kinship beliefs: biology, shared biogenetic substance, nature as in 'what animals do' and human nature as 'man is a special part of nature' - the contradictions here remain unexplored.

Franklin suggests:
```ad-quote
On the one hand, Schneider was arguing that there was no such thing as a biological fact per se in American kinship systems - there are only cultural interpretations of them. On the other hand, he was also arguing that there are 'natural facts' within science which are true and which are separate from the cultural constructions of them. (1997: 55).

```

This was in response to these passages, truncated:
```ad-quote
"These biological facts, the biological prerequisites for human existence, exist and remain ... the child does not live without the milk ... come into being except by the fertalised egg ... there is also a system of constructs in American culture about these biological facts ... these biological constructs which depict these biological facts have ... a symbolic quality ... in addition to their existence as biological facts." (1980: 116)
```


### Schneider, A Critique of the Study of Kinship

Here, Schneider subjected a scrutiny into the study of kinship, demonstrating how sexual procreation was central to anthropological definitions. There was an assumption in Euro-American folk beliefs about kinship which had been imported into anthropological analysis ...  "if kinship was not the same thing in different cultures, then the comparative endeavour of anthropology failed, because like was quite simply not being compared with like" (8)

Schneider held back from abandoning the very separation he investigated - the link between culture and biology.

```ad-quote
"The point remains that culture, even were it to do no more than recognize biological facts, still adds something to those facts. The problem remains of just what the sociocultural aspects are, of what meaning is added, of where and how that meaning, as a meaning rather than as a biological fact, articulates with other meanings. (1984: 1999)"

```

It helped demonstrate the Eurocentric assumptions of the heart of anthropological study. It was paradoxical that his earlier work on American kinship helped provide a fertile model for later cultural accounts of kinship.

"Perhaps it is not surprising in retrospect that Schneider's stronger position, which focused on the 'meanings' of kinship rather than on formal properties seemed to have offered greater possibilities for the future study of kinship ... (9) "

### Relatedness

"British students ... have been accustomed to think of kinship in terms of the social ... American cultural anthropology focuses on meaning .... there has ... been an implicit rapprochement between these schools..." (2000: 4)

Authors in this volume use relatedness instead of kinship as a signal to open indigenous idioms of being related than relying on pre-given definitions.

```ad-quote

The obvious problem with relatedness is that either it is used in a restricted sense to convey relations in some way founded on genealogical connection, in which case it is open to similar problems as kinship ... or it is used in a more general sense to encompass other kinds of social relations ... it becomes ... broad. (5)

### Strathern

Marilyn Strathern, in *After Nature*, argues that nature can no longer be taken for granted since technological developments have resulted in a destabilisation of nature - the 'modern cycle' meant new conceptualisation of the ground for knowledge.

If one considers reproductive technologies seen as 'assisting nature' then kin relationships could be seen as having their basis in nature, socially recognised. "The significant shift is that what was taken to be natural has become a matter for choice; nature has been, as she puts it, 'enterprised-up' (10) - the more nature is assisted, the more difficult it becomes to think of nature as independent of social intervention.

In the English view, kinship is defined as the meeting place of nature and culture (Strathern 1992a:87). Kinship facts are both part of nature and part of culture - a dual function that regarded itself as a grounding for culture and provided an image between culture and nature,

Strathern's conclusion highlights the centrality of pregiven biological facts to Western knowledge practices and kinship relations - the cultural constructions of 'natural facts' ahve been studied hard. Scientific facts are shown not simply as 'pure truths' but awaiting discovery.
