[[Emile Durkheim]]

[[Introducing symbolism, signifiers standing for signifieds]]

1-3

To study the simplest and most primitive religion that is known at the present is to discover its principles and attempt an explanation of it.

Sociology's aim is to explain a present reality that is near to us and capable of affecting our ideas and actions - it is present-day man that we have an interest in.

It is a fundamental postulate of sociology that human institution cannot rest upon error and falsehood - it could not endure. Therefore when Durkheim approaches the study of primitive religions, it is with the certainty that they are real.

We must know how to reach beneath the symbol to grasp the reality it represents and that gives the symbol its true meaning - the most bizarre rites translate some human need and aspect of life.

Fundamentally then, there are no religions that are false - all are true after their own fashion and all fulfil given conditions of human existence. It is not impossible to rank them hierarchically. All are equally religious.

We cannot arrive at an understanding of the most modern religions without tracing historically the manner in which they have gradually taken shape - history is the only method of explanatory analysis that can be applied to them, history enables us to break down an institution and reveal it for what they are. By situating each part of the institutions in which they were born, history puts in our hands the tools we have. When we set to explain something, we must do it at its historical form.

What we must find is a concrete reality that historical and ethnographic observation alone can reveal to us. Even the most specialized scholars must choose a hypothesis and take their inspiration from it.

The study Durkheim undertakes is a way of taking up again the old problem of the origin of religions but under new conditions - there is no radical instant when religion began to exist. Like every other human institution, religion begins nowhere - Durkheim wants to find a way of discerning the causes of religious thought.

The lack of complexity in primitive societies and their religions become useful experiments in which the facts and the relation among facts are easier to detect - the physicist seeks to simplify these phenomena and rid them of their secondary characteristics.

Research is not solely to the science of religion - there is an aspect of every religion that transcends the realm of religious ideas.

There is no religion that is not both a cosmology and a speculation about the divine - religion itself began by serving as science and philosophy, religion has not merely enriched a human intellect already formed but has helped them form it.

At the root of our judgement there are certain fundamental notions that dominate our life - categories of understanding, notions of time, space, number, cause, substance, philosophy. They act like solid frames that confine thought - thought does not seem to be able to break out of them without destroying itself.

The general condition of the chapters to follow is that religion is an eminently social thing - religious representations are collective representations that express collective realities; rites are ways of acting meant to evoke mental state of those groups - they must be products of collective thoughts.

A totem expresses and symbolises two different kind of things - on one hand it is the outward and visible form of what I have called the totemic principle or god, and it is also the symbol of a society that is called the clan.

Society must arouse the sensation of the divine - a society is to its members what a god is to its faithful. A god is first of all a being that man conceives of as superior to himself and one whom he believes he depends.

...

This theory of totemism has enabled us to explain the most characteristic beliefs of the religion. We must ask about how this idea was formed - what caused the clan to choose an emblem? Why animals and plants, but especially animals?

By expressing the social unit tangibly it makes the unit itself more tangible to all. For that reason, the use of emblematic symbols must have spread quickly as soon as the idea was born. This idea must have arisen spontaneously from the conditions of life in common, for the emblem serves to create that awareness.

Individual consciousnesses are closed to one another and can only communicate by means of signs in which their inner states come to express themselves.

The appearance of this resultant notifies individuals that they are in unions and brings home to them their moral unity. It is by shouting the same cry, saying the same words and performing the same action that they arrive at agreement.

Collective representations are another matter - they presuppose that consciousnesses are acting and reacting on one another, resulting from actions. They contribute to its making. It is by the homogeneity of these movements that make the groups ware of itself and make it be - serving to symbolize the corresponding representations.

Without symbols social feelings could only have an unstable existence. These feelings are strong that as long as men are assembled, they are left only in memory.

We must guard against those symbols as mere artifices - they are integral to those representations. The fact that collective feelings find themselves joined in this way is not conventional - it portrays a real feature of social phenomena: their transcendence of individual consciousness.

Social life is only possible thanks to a vast symbolism. Collective feelings can just as well be incarnated in persons as in formula - some formulas are flags and so on. Let's consider tattooing - it is produced by a sort of automatic action, men are led to pain themselves in a way that remind them of their common life.

The best way of testifying to oneself of your identity is to place the distinctive mark on the body - the tattoo, made of lines and points, are given an entirely conventional meaning. The purpose of that image is to testify that individuals share the same moral life.

The clan is a society that is less able than any other without an emblem and a symbol. The clan cannot be defined by its leader or territory or locality.

The unity off the group can be felt only because of the collective name borne by all the members and because of the equally collective emblem representing the thing designated by that name. A clan is essentially a company of individuals who have the same name and rally around the same symbol. Take away the name and the symbol and that clan can no longer even be imagined.

Why animals?

The emblematic image called for a subject representable - men are in close company with animals, an essential element of the economic environment. Plants took second place so long as they are not cultivated.

If the fundamental notion of science are of religious origins, how could religion have engendered them? The reality that religious thought expresses is society - the question i posed: what could make social life such an important source of logical life? Nothing predisposed society for this role.

The basic material of logical thought is concept. To discover how society could have played a role in the genesis of logical thought amounts to asking how it could have taken part in the formation of concept.

The individual can compare his images but the general exists only in the particular; it is the particular, simplified and stripped down of values and privileges that the general does not have. Inversely, conceptual thought cannot extend to the individual.

There are many objects that have individual objects - Gods for example. Each of us have a certain notion of the individual whom we are in contact with - their character, appearance, individuals. Therefore, concept must be defined by other traits.

Sense representations are in perpetual flux - they come and go like the ripples of a stream and are linked with the exact moment in which it occurs. The concept however is outside time and shielded from all disturbance: it is a way of thinking that at any given moment in time is fixed and crystallized. The system of concepts with which we think in everyday life is the one the vocabulary of our mother tongue expresses. Language is fixed; it changes but slowly.

At the same time as being unchangeable, a concept is universal. It is impossible for me to make a sensation pass from my consciousness into someone else's - it is closely dependent on my body and personality and cannot be detached from them. All we can do is invite another person to set himself before the same object as we open ourselves to its influence. By contrast, conversation and intellectual dealings among men consist in an exchange of concepts. The concept is, in essence, an impersonal representation - how human intelligences communicate.

Defined in that way, the nature of the concept bespeaks its origins - common to all because it is the work of the community, not bearing the imprint of any individual intellect. Its collective representations are stable.

Whenever we are in a presence of a type of thought or action that presses on individual intellect or wills, the pressure on the individual reveals the intervention of the collectivity - the concepts with which we routinely think are those deposited in the vocabulary. It is beyond doubt that speech and the system of concepts it translates is the product of a collective elaboration.

There are scarcely any words whose meaning does not to some degree go beyond the limits of our personal experience - often a term expresses things we have never perceived and experiences we have never witnessed.

Concepts are collective representations - they are replete with knowledge surpassing that of the average individual. They are not abstract things that have reality only in particular circumstances but more than that - they are representations just as concrete as any individual can make of his own environment as they correspond to have special being that is society thinks about the things of its own experience.

Because of its scope, society can hardly be affected by any but their most general and lasting properties.

This is what makes conceptual thought valuable - concepts are more than general ideas, they are collective representations and add to what our personal experience can teach us all the wisdom and science that the collectivity has amassed over centuries.

We can see society's share in the origin of logical thought - logical thought is possible only when man has managed to go beyond the fleeting representation he owes to sense experience to conceive a whole world of stable ideals, the common ground of intelligence. To think logically, to think impersonally - to be stable, the two characteristics of truth.

People believe logical life must have appeared spontaneously but there is nothing in direct experience to suggest it. It took centuries to emerge and take space.

Solely because society exists, there exists beyond sensations and images a whole system of representations that possess marvelling properties. By means of them, men understand one another: they have a force and moral authority by virtue of which they impose themselves upon individual minds. The individual realizes that above his private representations there is a whole world of type-ideas according to which he has to regulate his own - an intellectual world greater than he.

The great majority of the concepts that we use are not methodically constructed, we come by them from language - concepts that are scientifically wrought and criticized are always in a very small minority. Secondly, there are only differences of degrees between those concepts and the ones that draw all their authority only from the fact of being collective. A collective representation presents assurances of objectivity.

Concepts are far from taking their authority from their objective value alone - it is not enough that they be true, they must be in harmony with other beliefs and opinions.

A man who did not think with concepts would not be a man for he would not be a social being - limited to individual perceptions alone, he would not be distinct from an animal. In that case, the lower societies could appear to be ignorant of the concept for they have only undeveloped processes of generalization and the notions they use are generally not well defined.

## IV

We take a final question - where did they (categories and social things) get this trait?

Since they are themselves concepts, we can understand that they are the work of the collectivity - their stability and impersonality are such that they have often been taken to be absolutely universal and immutable. It seems obvious that they are created by society.

The problem is more complex - not only do they come from society but the very things they express are social. It is not that they are instituted by society but their content is various aspects of the social being. Why is it then that the models they were built upon have been borrowed from society?

The answer is that these are preeminent concepts that have a preponderant role in knowledge - the function of the categories is to govern and contain the other concepts. They form the permanent framework of mental life. To encompass such an object, they must be modelled on a reality of wide scope.

The individual lives in time and has a certain sense of temporal orientation - he is at a definite point in space and it has been possible to hold that all sensations have a spatial aspects. He has a sense of similarity. We also have the sensation of a certain regularity in the order of succession in phenomena, even the animal is not incapable of that.

This notion of the whole cannot come to us from the individual himself who is only part of the whole. Yet there is no fundamental category. The category par excellence would be the very concept of totality. The theorists of knowledge postulate totality.

The concept of totality is but the concept of society in abstract form. It is the whole that includes all things, the supreme class that contains all other classes. Such is the underlying principle on which rest those primitive classifications.

There is another reason why constituent elements of the categories must have been taken from social life: the relationships they express could not become conscious relationships except in and through society. Even if they are immanent in the life of the individual, the individual had little means or reason to grasp them. To orient himself in space he had no need for a conceptual representation of time or space.

Society is possible only if the individual and things that make it up are divided among different groups and classified in relation to one another. Society presupposes a conscious organization of itself that is nothing more than a classification - that organization of society is naturally passed on to the space it occupies. In other words, the space must be divided and oriented.

To summarize, society is not illogical and the changeable being it is imagined. The collective consciousness is the highest form of psychic life. Collective consciousness sees things only in their permanent aspect in which it crystalizes in ideas that can be communicated. It embraces all known reality. They express ways of being that appear with full clarity.

Moreover, the factors that brought this development seem to be no different in kind from those that brought it forth originally. Things can no longer fit within the social frames where they were originally classified; they must be organized with principles of their own; logical organization thus differentiates itself from social organization and becomes autonomous.

Collective thought is possible only through the coming together of individuals, hence it presupposes the individuals and they in turn presuppose it because they cannot sustain themselves except by coming together. In short there is something impersonal in us because there is something social in us and since social life embraces both representation and practices, that impersonality extends naturally to ideas and actions.
