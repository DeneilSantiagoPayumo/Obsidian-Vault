# Preface: On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs.
## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Paraphrased findings found from his essay
Why is it that [[John Maynard Keynes]] predict that increasing technological innovation would have made it so that countries like GB or the US would be able to cut back on the work week when in reality this didn't happen?

Why is that we have seen a massive drop in workers employed as domestic servants with an increase in professional, managerial and clerical workers increasing? Why has the service sector increased - with the creation of industries like financial services, telemarking or the expansion of sectors like corporate law, academic and health administration, HR and PR? Why are there industries to provide help to those industries?

These are what he calls bullshit jobs: it is as though there are pointless jobs that Capitalism is creating. After all, the last thing a profit seeking firm is going to do is shell money to workers they don't need to employ.

In reality, the number of these workers seems to expand working forty or fifty hour weeks on paper but effectively working fifteen hours: spending their time organizing or attending motivational seminars.

"The answer clearly isn't economic: it's moral and political. The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger ... And, on the other hand, the feeling that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to submit themselves to some intense work discipline for most of their waking hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them."
```

Most people working these bullshit jobs recognise that they are bullshit. What does it say about our society that there seems to be an extremely limited demand in poet-musicians but an infinite demand for specialists in corporate law? (The answer: if one percent of the population controls most of disposable wealth, what we call 'the market' reflects what **they** think is useful or important.)

This is a profoundly psychological violence here: how can one speak of dignity in labour when one secretly feels one's job should not exist? How can it not create deep rage and resentment ... but in our society, the rage is directed against those who do meaningful work. What happens if nurses, garbage collectors or mechanics lose their job?

There is a sense that 'this is the way things should be' - Republicans have had remarkable success mobilizing against schoolteachers and autoworkers. Real productive workers are relentlessly squeezed and exploited.

### Post-Essay

Once this essay was published, it blew up on social media. Many people emailed the author to ask about them, tell him how he inspired them to quit their job and so on. Even YouGov did a poll on asking if Britons made a meaningful contribution to the world, with only just above a third (37%) said they believed it did not.

This book aims to be more systematic: this theory is not a conspiracy theory, but rather an anti-conspiracy theory. Why *wasn't* action taken?

The phenomenon of bullshit employment can provide us a window on much deeper social forces - why do people in the workforce find themselves labouring at pointless tasks, yet find this state of affair to be normal, inevitable and desirable? Why should people believe that those working 'pointless' jobs should be paid more, but feel depressed in the same role? There is a jumble of contradictory ideas here.

It's like we have collectively acquiesced to our own enslavement.

# CHAPTER 1: What Is a Bullshit Job?
## A collection of key ideas from the article
### Idea 1

Example of a Bullshit Job:
```ad-example
title: Kurt works for a subcontractor of a subcontractor of a subcontractor for the German military. 23-24
The German miltiary has a subcontractor that does their IT work.
The IT firm has a subcontractor that does their logistics.

The logistics firm has a subcontractor that does their personnel management, and I work for that company.

Let's say soldier A moves to an office two rooms farther down the hall. Instead of just carrying his computer over there, he has to fill out a form.

The IT subcontractor will get the form, people will read it and approve it, and forward it to the logistics firm.

The logistics will then have to approve the moving down the hall and will request personnel from us.

The office people in my company will then od whatever they do and now I come in.

I get an email: "Be at brracks B at time C." Usually these barracks are one hundred to five hundred kilometers away from my home, so i will get a rental car. I take the rental car, drive to the barracks, let dispatch know that I arrived, fill out a form, unhook the computer, load the computer into a box, seal the box, have a guy from the logistics firm carry the box to the next room, where I unseal the box, fill out another form, hook up the computer, call dispatch to tell them how long I took, get a couple of signatures, take my rental car back home, send dispatch a letter with all the paperwork and then get paid.

So instead of the soldier carrying his computer for five meteres, two people drive for a combined six to ten hours, fill out around fifteen pages of paperwork, and waste a good four hundred euros of taxpayers' money.

```

```ad-quote

This I consider the defining feature of a bullshit job: one so completely pointless that even the person who has to perform it every day cannot convince himself there's a good reason for him to be doing it.

Provisional Definition: a bullshit job is a form of employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence.
```



Why does it feel wrong to say that a hitman has a bullshit job?
- One is that a Mafia hit man is unlikely to make false claims, claim he is merely a 'businessman'
- Tend to be more upfront about what he does
- Unlikely to pretend his work is beneficial to society

We thus redefine the phrase of a bullshit job:
```ad-quote
title: 29
Provisional Definition 2: a bullshit job is a form of employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though the empployee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.
```

Additionally, the hitman is not personally convinced his job should not exist: mafiosi believe they are part of an ancient or honourable tradition that has value in its own right.

Also, it is not entirely clear that hitman is a 'job' in the first place. A crime boss makes up some dummy security job for him in his casino - *that* job is a bullshit job, but he's not receiving a pay-check in his capacity as a hitman.

Thereof, when people speak of bullshit jobs, they are referring to employment that involves working for someone else on a waged or salaried basis.

```ad-quote
title: 30
Final Working Definition: a bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecesssary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.
```

This definition as the reader may note is completely subjective. The author notes that the worker is correct - assuming there's an underlying reality to these things.

What if this lower-level workers cannot see their importance? "But it's been my experience that any underling who works for the same outfit for any length of time - say, a year or two - will normally be taken aside and let in on the company secrets."

"If the preponderance of those engaged in a certain occupation privately believe their work is of no social value, one should proceed along the assumptions they are right." (32)

Therein, the more harm a category of people do in the world, the more yes-men and propagandists will tend to accumulate and convince them the reasons why they are doing really good.

There is a difference between bullshit and shit jobs:
"The only reason why I bring up the matter is because the two are confused - which is odd, because they're in no way similar. In fact, they might almost be considered opposites. Bullshit jobs often pay quite well and tend to offer excellent working conditions. They're just pointless. Shit jobs are usually not all bullshit: they typically involve work that needs to be done and is clearly of benefit to society; it's just that the workers who do them are paid and treated badly." (34)

Some jobs are intrinsically unpleasant but fulfilling in other ways. These jobs can be considered neither bullshit or shit.

"Shit jobs tend to be blue collar and pay by the hour, whereas bullshit jobs tend to be white collar and salaried." (35) - at least they know that they're doing something useful. Those who work bullshit jobs are well paid and treated as high achievers yet they are aware that they have achieved nothing.

These are two different forms of oppression. It is also theoretically possible to have a job that is shit and oppressive.


We have established three categories of jobs: useful jobs, bullshit jobs and a small penumbra of jobs like gangsters, slumlords, lawyers and more.

In each case, I think it's fair to assume that the person who are doing these jobs knows what's best. Some may, upon receiving the notion of a bullshit job, talk about government bureaucrats or hairdressers.

Plenty of people would argue bureaucrats are useless. "The assumption that government is necessarily top-heavy with featherbedding and unnecessary levels of administrative hierarchy, while the private sector is lean and mean, is by now so firmly lodged in people's heads that it seems no amount of evidence will dislodge it." (37)

```ad-quote
title: 38
"When managers began trying to come up with scientific studies of the most time- and energy- efficient ways to deploy human labour, they never applied those same techniques to themselves - or if they did, the effect appears to have been the opposite of what they intended. As a result, the same period that saw the most ruthless application of spped-ups and downsizing in the blue-collar sector also brought a rapid multiplication of meaningless managerial and administrative posts in almost all large firms. It's as if businesses were endlessly trimming the fat on the shop floor and using the resulting savings to acquire even more unnecessary workers in the office upstairs."
```

Hairdressers are a poor notion of a bullshit job.
```ad-quote
title: 41
"Why is a hairdresser not a bullshit job? Well, the most obvious reasons is precisely *because* most hairdressers do not believe it to be one. To cut and style hair makes a demonstrable difference in the world, and the notion that it is unnecessary vanity is purely subjective: Who is to say whose judgement of the intrinsic value of hairstyling is correct?"

In working class communities, hair parlours often serve as gathering places; women of a certain age and background aare known to spend hours at the neighbourhood hair parlour, which becomes a place to swap local news and gossip.
```

If the retailer genuinely believes that he provides nothing of value to his customer, does the retail worker have a bullshit job? According to my own research, the number of retail workers who feel this way is actually quite small. "Purveyors of expensive perfumes might think their products are overpriced and their clients are mostly boorish idiots, but they rarely feel the perfume industry itself should be abolished." (42)

There are only three exceptions: IT providers, telemarketers, and sex workers. Many of the first and nearly all of the second believe they are engaged in scams. Whereas the third is unique. 

A former sex-worker, now professor, argued:
	"Sex work clearly did answer a genuine consumer demand, something was terribly, terribly wrong with any society that effectively tells the vast majority of its female population they are worth more dancing on boxes between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five than they will be at any subsequent point in their lives, whatever their talents or accomplishments. If the same woman can make five times as much money stripping as she could teaching as a world-recognized scholar, could not the stripping job be considered bullshit simply on that basis?"


What about jobs that are partly bullshit?
Teachers in higher education spend increasing amounts of time filling out administrative paperwork - this can be documented. However, the process of bullshitization is highly inconsistent. It has for obvious reasons affected middle class employment more than working class employment. Within the working class, it is traditionally female, caregiving work that is the main target. (44).
