Chapter 1: an introduction into these questions 

Chapter 2: a glimpse of an emerging discourse that individuals enter in contradictory way

Chapter 3 and 4: focus on relations with "straight family" - the long term impact of a gay movement that encouraged gay people to disclose their sexual identities to heterosexuality

Chapter 5: "families we choose" side of the symbolic opposition between straight and gay families - changes in the conceptualization between friends and lovers appear as historical antecedents, treating community as a cultural category implicated in the renegotiation of kinship relations.

Chapter 6: a look at lesbian and gay lovers in relationships. This critiques the assumption that partners with a common gender identity participate in a relation of sameness - the use of mirror imagery reinforces stereotypes of gay men as self-absorbed.

Chapter 7: investigates the interest in lesbian and gay parenting, the lesbian baby representing an incorporation of biology into chosen families, at the same time challenging the centrality of heterosexual intercourse and a two person, opposite gender model of parenthood to kinship relations.

Chapter 8: the political implications of a discourse on gay kinship including the debate about whether gay families represent assimilation to a heterosexual mode. An expose of a rhetoric of models and paradigms - family-centred discourse bears the potential to change perceptions of gay people as it does to kinship.


Chapter 2 mainly covers this idea of the opposition in families. The chapter is likely to not be relevant.

## CHAPTER 3: COMING OUT TO 'BLOOD' RELATIVES

...

No common tradition can account for similar theories advanced by people claiming such varied cultural identities - people made these arguments by drawing a symbolic contrast between Latino families portrayed as solidary units presumed to transmit class and ethnicity, and white families depicted as piecemeal assemblies of roles and relationships.

Individuals sometimes credited historical circumstances for bringing about solidarity - Jews.

Third folk theory contended that families among people of colour are characterised by unconditional love, in contrast to white families that make love contingent upon behaviour.

In reality, these people had experiences of being 'kicked out' by relatives. Being thrown out were common fears among white gay families and everyone.

...

### FAMILY - WHICH FAMILY? 56

People of colour, whites with strong ethnic identities and people who considered themselves working class drew connections between sexual identity, race, class, ethnicity and kinship - their theories had three areas. First, emphasis on family as a solidary unit than a collection of members. Two, contrasts between close families attributed to people of colour and the working class versus white and managerial class families described as fragmented. Third, the distinction between the unconditional love believed to characterize families from the speaker's own background and the love assigned to families in dominant social categories.

## DISCURSIVE LOCATIONS 64

The heart of coming involves laying claim to a label understood to reflect back on total personhood.

What is spoken belongs to the social arena, demanding attention, discussion and response - control is implicit. Remaining closeted offers only an illusory sort of control, one likely to prove inadequate for preventing others from filtering a person's identity.

...

## TAKING IDENTITY, TALKING KINSHIP 67

Coming to blood family offers a unique opportunity to clarify kinship relations - the moment of disclosure might appear as the first step toward integrating straight family with the gay families that are families we choose.

The connection between coming out and the validation of adulthood had to do less with age than with cultural understandings that defined childhood in relation to marriage.

Some people based the timing on coming out on developments such as 'having a lover, deciding to coparent a child' or even doing it whilst they are single. They would have to acknowledge bonds that linked him to his lover, strengthening the relationship with [Andy's] mother.

### SELECTION AND REJECTION 73

Because positive responses to coming reaffirmed a kinship that was threatened, they import choice into the notion of blood family - joining something to 'work for' and 'fight for'. When a break of biological kin occurs, people are likely to speak of relations as 'lost.'

Bonds symbolized by blood prove terminable because they are selectively perpetuated rather than naturally given - individuals set about editing their family trees by arranging relatives along a continuum defined by poles of closeness and distance.

Some people reported subjecting blood ties to new scrutiny.

For gay people, biology and choice becomes ideologically salient as categories structuring kinship through lived experience of making decisions to remain closeted or not - the experience of contemplating discourse adds new dimensions of meaning to the symbolic constituents of kinship. Coming out brought 'choice' to the centre of awareness and making it explicit as a facet of kinship relations.


## CHAPTER 4: KINSHIP AND COHERENCE: TEN STORIES 76

In the context of coming out to relatives, portraying continuity of self served to counter the implication that being gay transforms a person into something alien and deviant.

There are indications that biographical continuity can be equally important to blood kin - attempting to come to terms with a relative's sexual identity.

The insistence on being the 'same person' draws on cultural notions of selfhood as a matter of being rather than doing, of consistency rather than absolute transfiguration. In a a situation where the shared substance symbolized by blood might prove insufficient to guarantee kinship, coming out to straight family was often aimed at eliciting signs that would confirm family ties.

A woman named Gina had her parents discover her gay identity. Relatives here appear as agents of disrupted kinship.

Scott McFarland tried to commit suicide because of his gay identity. Under the influence of the medical model, he viewed death as a better option than living as a gay man. The act of telling his story, often stifled, made his identity as the experience of coming out.

Rafael discusses his gay identity. His father is a boxer, his mother is a homophobe: she controlled the discourse by telling other relatives herself.

...

One way of denying continuity of self to justify a break in kinship is to split the self into parts and label one part as more true and real. Misha's parents did not argue that she turned into a lesbian as that would have admitted temporal discontinuity, but that she did not know her mind because she was influenced by her gay friends.

Her father insisted on reducing sexual identity to a matter of sex. it strikes at the heart of what it means when gay people talk of straight families - they distinguish categories of blood, referring back to the symbolism of biological procreation through heterosexual intercourse.

Al went out drinking with his father. It refuted the father's effeminate stereotype of gay men, allowing his parents to grieve over some incomprehensible transfiguration of their son's activities, revising their interpretation of the category "homosexual".

Vince's story: his parents tried to search another way to challenge perceived discontinuity. Vince needed distance to establish his independence, and acknowledged his gay identity to be fundamental to his selfhood.

## CHAPTER 5: FAMILIES WE CHOOSE

*The author is discussing about her own circumstances.*

Efforts to encourage a low-key atmosphere framed our interactions during supper as everyday experience rather than a guest-host relationship. Conversation seldom felt obligatory - also facilitating the developing family feeling was a sense of time depth that arose after the arrangement.

Faced with the task of analysing this type of self-described family relationship among lesbians and gay men, the inclination was to treat it as an instance of what anthropologists have termed 'fictive kin'.

Here, genes and blood appeared like symbols implicated in one culturally specific way of demarcating and calculating relationships. Under the influence of continental philosophy, literary criticism, and an emerging critique of narrative form in ethnographic writing, anthropological monographs.

The very concept of a substitute suffers from a functionalism that assumes people intrinsically *need* families. Here, relationships are said to be 'like' families. While framed as a defence of participants' perspectives, this type of argument implicitly takes blood relations as its point of departure. Insofar as analysis becomes circumscribed by the unvoiced question that asks how authentic these "fictive" relations are, it makes little difference that authenticity refers back to a privileged and apparently unified symbolic system rather than an empirically observable.

Some might contend that these emergent ideologies represent variations modelled on a more generalized "American kinship" to the extent that they utilize familiar symbols such as blood and love ...

Gay families do not occupy a subsidiary domain that passively reflects or imitates the primary tenets of a coherent "American kinship system" - the historical construction of an ideological contrast between chosen families and blood family has not left biologistic and procreative conceptions of kinship untouched.

### BUILDING GAY FAMILIES 107

It has become a truism that "family" can mean very different things when complicated by classes, race, ethnicity, and gender. In her studies of kinship, Sylvia Yanagisako has demonstrated how the unit used to calculate relatedness may change, and additional meanings adhere to symbols like love based on variable definitions of context that invoke racial or cultural identities.

Situated chosen families in the context of an ideological opposition between families defined as straight and gay - biology and choice.

The families of gay men and lesbians had fluid boundaries. [[David Schneider]] characterized this as one that can "create kinship ties out of relationships which are originally ties of friendship."

In the Bay Area, families we choose resembled networks in the sense that they could cross household lines and were based on ties that radiated outward from individuals like spokes on a wheel. Gay families differed from networks in that they consciously incorporated symbolic demonstrations of love, shared history, material or assistance.

Fluid boundaries meant no defined cycles of expansion, no neatly replicable units - in the language of others, significance rested in the eye of the beholder. Participants tended to depict their chosen families as thoroughly individualistic affairs.

By opening the door to the creation of families different in kind and composition, choice assigned kinship to the realm of free will and inclination. Each gay man and lesbian became responsible for the act of creating an ideal environment - presenting gay families as a foray into uncharted territory where the lack of cultural guideposts to mark the journey engendered fear and exhilaration.

Despite the characterization of gay families as freely chosen, they were less demographically representative - list was composed of other lesbians and gay men.

Overall, the interface between property relations and kinship relations among lesbians and gay men who called one another family seemed consistent with other relations, with the exception of financial independence on each part of each member of a couple. Individuals distributed their own earnings and resources.

Across household lines, services exchanged between members of different households included walking a dog to preparing meals, or even extending loans. A shared past was what differentiated friends from friends who were families.

### SUBSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES 116

Many lesbians and gay men alluded to the difficulty of constructing kinship in the absence of models. Others have abandoned this viewpoint that chosen families offer substitute for blood ties lost through outright rejection or distance - they fill some of the emptiness of blood family.

Most of the services that chosen kin provide for one another may be performed by relatives calculated according to blood, adoption or marriage.

This theory views them as replacements. When Bay Area gays applied kinship terminology, they typically viewed kinship terminology to their chosen families, placing themselves in the relationship of sisters and brothers to one another.

### FRIENDS AND LOVERS 117

Discussions of gay families pictured kinship as an extension of friendship - both friend and family.

An important distinction - learning to discriminate between feelings of erotic and non-erotic love, drawing contrasts between sexual attraction and friendship.

The category of mentor appeared to be fading.

This shift from contrast to continuum laid the ground for the rise of a family-centred discourse that bridged the erotic and non-erotic.

### FROM FRIENDSHIP TO COMMUNITY 121

In context, community can refer to the historical appearance of gay institutions, the totality of self-defined lesbians and gay men, or unity and harmony predicated upon a common sexual identity.

Finding community meant finding shared stories - sexuality was constituted as a ground of common experience than a personal domain.

In extending homosexuality beyond the sexual, the notion of identity-based community opened new possibilities for using kinship terminology to imagine lesbians and gay men as members of a unified totality.

While the use of kinship terminology to indicate community membership has fallen into disfavour as the politics of identity have given way 

Identity and community have become polarized in ways that presuppose culturally specific values of individualisms. During the same period, lesbians and gay of colour critiqued the simplistic assumption that mutual understanding would flow from a shared identity.

### DELIBERATING DIFFERENCE 129

Many gay men and lesbians began to doubt the existence of "the" community or any single gay lifestyle - "I am who I am", individualism.

The most popular alternative was to divest community of its egalitarian associations by using it as a proxy for 'population': one indication of the muddle in the model of community, people qualify the term by adding a phrase such as whatever that means.

The practice of identity politics in the United States has rested upon the cultural configuration of race, ethnicity, class, gender and sexual identity - what motivated the transition from speakness sameness to a division of community into ever-narrower circumscriptions of identity.

136

When gay groups in southern California suggested adding a lambda to the rainbow flag supposed to represent all gay people, lesbians denounced the addition as a non-inclusive male symbols. Disagreements periodically erupted concerning the proportion of men's to women's coverage in newspapers that attempted to serve "the community" as a whole - it is not common for lesbians and gay men to stereotypes.

Class differences traced out lines of division within as well as between the men's and women's communities, many lesbians attributed the visibility of gay male institutions as men have greater access to money than women.

Individuals who had purposefully sought employment in gay businesses reported their surprise at finding the gay employer-employee relationship as marked by conflict and difference as any other. In a dispute, it turns out that both sides were perplexed that sexual identity could not be solved at hand.

In contrast, the family-centred emerging during this period did not assume identity ... based upon sexuality alone. Defined in opposition to biological family, the concept of families we choose proved attractive it reintroduced agency and a subjective sense of making culture into lesbian and gay social organizations. Families also supplied the face-to-face relationships. Chosen families something rather novel into kinship relations by grouping friends together with lovers and children within a single cultural domain.

## CHAPTER 6: LOVERS THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS

The assumption that gender identity will be the primary subjective identity for every lesbian and gay men, universally and without respect for context, remains just that: an assumption.

For example: interracial couples. Likeness does not automatically follow from a common racial identity than from a shared general identity.

Refracting relationships through looking-glass imagery leads discussion toward the catch-all terms of sameness and difference but ignores in what *way* are they the same and in what *respect* are they different.


Examining the possibilities for creating differently gendered relations within lesbian and gay couples.

Partners looked for congruence, not similarity: people who dress differently and not in drag, people dressing more 'masculine', wanting softness or sensitivity in body.

One man might don a tweed jacket for that yuppie look in the hope of attracting another in work boots and jeans. The self-identification of a minority of gay men as 'top man' or 'bottom man' within a relationship testified to the incapacity of looking-glass language to grasp the complexities of phenomena that pass for affinity.

That mirrors can reflect inversion as well as likeness is recognized by anyone who has ever learned to tie a tie with the aid of a looking glass.

Chapter 5 explored how gay men invoke criteria of emotional and material assistance: they want someone to count on. For them, confidence in their ability to secure support from kin concealed an emphasis on self-sufficiency.

Many people cited the lack of any prescribed division of labour between members of a couple as one index of an egalitarian relationship. In descriptions of relationships, some allocations characterized chores as 50/50. Both partners were expected to pursue paid employment.

The portrayal of lovers as a union of equals rather than a relation of subjugation has clear ties to romantic ideologies of heterosexual marriage. Yet some gay people regarded it as having equality be a main thing. Heterosexual relationship appeared to them to lack the structural ties and foundations to foster equality in place of male dominance.

...

The egalitarian ideal has the potential to assimilate competing ideologies of androgyny, affinity, humanism, and contrast or complementarity. What counts as a 50/50 allocation of tasks is up to anyone. Lesbians thought that it was based on unity of symbolic opposites.

...

*This passage discusses merging theory, that many considered a tendency to merge inherent in the likeness they attributed to lesbian and gay male relationships*

In the United States, many people believe that in the absence of distinctions between partners, the boundaries understood to demarcate self and order the social world would prove difficult to construct - they view social ties as fragile and susceptible to dissolution, they believe larger social wholes must be fabricated from the building block of selves defined through difference.


Mirrors remain an organizing metaphor in many theories of psychological development.

The resonance between mirror imagery in depictions of gay couples show a confused relationship with their environment, failing to progress from identification to differentiation. After being refracted through the looking glass, a lesbian or gay relationship appears as a mark of inadequacy and immaturity.

A theory that has arose: gay men and lesbians lack significant interpersonal and kinship ties ... that the lover appears as a proxy for the image in the mirror.

Because gay and lesbian identity is organised in terms of gender and sexuality, the most visible gay institution have occupied the personal sphere of leisure and consumption: the heterogeneity of this study belies conjecture that gay people are predominantly white, male, wealthy, selfish and more. To claim an identity is not to subscribe to a particular way of organizing one's time and interests.

Attributions of wealth that ascribe class privilege to all gay people are linked to the reduction of sexual identity to sexuality, to presumptions that gay men and lesbians lack family ties.

In the context of families, responsibility carries an implicitly social orientation: a person is responsible to someone or for someone. A few lesbians subscribed to the ideology of family as a burden and responsibility that restricted personal freedom.

More common were complaints about co-workers who assumed that a gay man had no immediate family or financial dependents. If an individual was known to have a lover, acquaintances sometimes trivialized the relationship. Many heterosexuals do not recognise the potential for lesbians to be involved in childcare.

They have become adept at refuting accusations of gay selfishness and irresponsibility.

Depictions that locate gay and lesbian lovers within a relation of sameness reinforce popular perceptions that gay people enjoy class privilege because they lack dependents and kinship ties. There are nuances of narcissism embedded in mirror imagery that conflates the persons within lesbian and gay couples, turning relations symbolically constituted by love back in upon the self.

...

## COUPLES VERSUS COMMUNITY

Lost in this sea of sameness are subtleties such as the longstanding tension between gay couples and gay communities. They claimed that they didn't prefer having a partner over being single

When chosen families emerged during the 1980s they bore the potential to mitigate this tension - gay families grouped friends with lovers. They pointed with pride to families that did not reduce to a couple.

...

## REFLECTION ON METAPHOR

To emphasize continuities between lovers is to assume that gender is the only identity with the most subjective significance to each, when partners clearly do not experience it as such. To equate difference with dependence assumes gender to be the most meaningful attribute that orders experience.

One effect of this imagery is to make relationships between lesbians lovers appear inadequate.

... the author describes the looking glass metaphor for the rest of the chapter.  To pit it simply, the passive reflection of lesbian and gay couples denies difference and agency and interaction. Where is the gaze observed? Each individual must draw out interpretations from another.

# CHAPTER SEVEN: PARENTING IN THE AGE OF AIDS 165

In actuality, lesbian and gay parenting is nothing new. One thing that has changed is the conviction that a person should get married or at least renounce gay involvements if he or she wants children.

Rather than maintaining a heterosexual façade, more parents who identify as gay or lesbian have integrated their children into the gay families that are the families we create. Those without children have a lot of options: foster care, surrogate parenthood, adoption, coparenting, alternative insemination and 'old-fashioned' sex.

The focus here will be on lesbian mothers. Primarily, the lesbian baby boom.

## THE LEBSIAN MOTHER AS ICON 167

If motherhood can render lesbian invisible, lesbian identity can obscure parenthood.

We will focus on this method of 'choosing children' - as the practice of alternative insemination spread among lesbians, relations conceived as blood ties surfaced where one might least expect them: in the midst of gay families that had been defined in opposition to the biological relations gay and lesbians ascribed to straight family.

It is the prospect of physical procreation that renders the lesbian mother at once icon and conundrum. Babies conceived demand a reconciliation of a nonprocreative lesbian identity with procreative practice. Any reconciliation will be complicated by the notions of gender and personhood embedded in particular ideologies of kinship.

Biological offspring conceived through alternative insemination need not be 'conceived' as a product of two persons in this sense. Lesbians use the term 'donor' to describe a man who supplies semen for insemination.

Some lesbians don't want to know the donor's identity, mixes sperm from several donors to trace a child's genitor and more. This eliminates body-to-body contact. Some women refer only to 'semen' making the pair: woman plus sperm.

The author describes children after divorce who don't call the parents mom and dad but a variety of terms. The children of lesbian parents might call them 'mama' and some varieties. This widespread heterosexual preoccupation with nomenclature with an inability to imagine solutions to the problem seems curious.

Some people think damn the child needs a masculine and feminine role model. The author disputes this: most lesbian mothers who shared responsibility for raising a child made no special effort to minimize their differences but formulated those differences in terms of a new and gender-neutral contrast. For lesbian parents, the distinction shifted from being 'the mother' to 'the one having the baby' - reclassification defined as parental identities through difference but became a difference organized in terms of biological versus nonbiological parenthood rather than mother versus father. One effect of this shift was to underscore the congruence between procreative potential and lesbian identity, positioning lesbian mothers as mediators of these ostensibly contradictory categories. It allows coparents in excess of two. (174)

More relevant in this context is the construction of any sort of gendered contrast is the notion that children would complete or legitimate a family. The lack of any prescribed number or gender for lesbian or gay parents, it opened the way for novel alliances between lesbian mothers and gay men they imaged as brothers prior to the lesbian baby boom.

## MALE-FEMALE REVISITED: INSEMINATION AND AIDS 175

Generally speaking, gay men have been every bit as excited as lesbians about the baby boom and the prospect of becoming parents.

It was AIDS that drew lesbians and gay men together after the 1970s. Lesbians adopted a variety of positions with respect to AIDS: there was those condemning gay men for promiscuity, or rather being empathetic towards gay men. The lack of government led to gay men making contact with lesbian women, building bridges.

With AIDS, people were scared to give off sperm. Gay men were assumed to recognise motherhood, but this was difficult, leading to people looking elsewhere.

In legal terms relationships between gay and lesbian lovers lack recognition in the United States. Thus, this legal situation accentuated the importance of finding donors who would not challenge the status of gay people as partners.

That said, the epidemic has not dampened their enthusiasm for raising children, nor has AIDS changed the way that alliances of lesbian and gay men as parents in one sense of the word embody a male-female symmetry between nonprocreative beings. This disrupts the unity of gendered opposites incarnated in the act of heterosexual coitus that represents a means to reproduction.

## OF DEATH AND BIRTH 180

AIDS in the bay area subjected gay men to a random terror. Volunteers have developed skills and social ties, organizing their needs. This isn't an automatic sentence of death but people coping with the impact of serious illness on their daily lives.

When gay men and lesbians greeted the baby boom, it was in a context that presented contrasts between life and death as something more than a cognitive context. In practice, lesbian and gay parenting. In practice lesbian and gay parenting countered associations of sex including the nineteenth-century link between homosexuality and morbidity.

Parenting constructs a particular type of kinship tie, an age-differentiated relationship that has added a generational dimension to gay community. Age cohorts represent generations of a sort, defined by symbolic events that incorporated new periodization of history: Stonewall generation, lesbian-feminist, AIDS and more.

In many Western societies, the succession of generations had come to represent visions of unilinear progress fulfilled. This movement toward a world without heterosexist which enlists the idealism of gays and lesbians to benefit generations yet to come out, looking with expectancy to the children raised within gay families for empathy and acceptance in the future.

For a child, belonging to a gay family did not depend upon claiming a gay identity. What qualified children for inclusion was being chosen by a self-identified lesbian or gay man. Lesbian and gay parents tended to see them substituting the freedom to choose a sexual identity for the generalized social pressure to be heterosexual.

The spatial imagery of children growing up within lesbian and gay communities offer a clue to the symbolic weight given to children who have been chosen after a parent has come out - in a manner uncomplicated by ties to former spouses or heterosexual partners.

Children raised by lesbian and gay parents carry gay families into a heterosexual future - accompanied by the diverse range of lesbian and gay experience.

## BLOOD RELATIVES RESPOND 185

Parenthood and AIDS have opened opportunities to negotiate relationships with blood relatives.

Contesting definitions of family can become all too evident in conflicts over a course of medical treatment or hospital visitation rights. When a gay man or lesbian dies, disputes over whether families we choose constitute 'real' or legitimate kin can affect wills, distribution of possessions, listings of survivors in obituaries, and disposition of the body.

Tensions surrounding the legitimacy and kinship character of social ties elaborated through families manifest themselves in struggles to define what relationship children raised in gay families will have to a lesbian or gay parent's blood relatives.

Many parents however still want children to 'go straight' or have children. Some encourage and support it. These mixed response by blood relatives indicate that the birthing and the raising have come arenas of contention in which discourse on gay kinship is formulated even as transformations of kinship ideologies are hammered out.

## PARENTINGS AND PERSONS

Why should alternative insemination have dominated the discussions of lesbian and gay parenting?

The experience of coming out to relatives convinced many that elements of choice shape even the ostensibly fixed substance of biological ties. Selectivity manifested in the discretionary power to judge the closeness of relationships and to alienate kinship ties in response to revelations of a gay or lesbian identity. It should not be surprising that families we choose capable of integrating biological .

Insemination subsumes notions of biology under the organizing metaphors of choice and creation that have defined gay kinship in opposition to blood family. Such incorporations represent not contradiction but rather the interplay between any two terms that define an ideological contrast through difference.

They considered a nonbiological mother, father or coparents no less works. Biological relatedness appeared to be a subsidiary option ranged alongside adoption, coparenting and so on within the dominant framework of choice that constituted families we create.

The distinction many gay people made between the biological and nonbiological parents perpetuated the salience of biology as a category referent for kinship relations.

There were those who felt that ethnicity was irrelevant and those who dreamed of adopting 'a child from every race' if money were no object.

When searching for a donor, prospective parents frequently specified race or ethnicity. Some, after AIDS, mixed metaphors in attempting to "create" a more direct "biological" link by asking brothers. The arrangement would have created a legally recognized blood tie to the child that could have supported a custody claim.

Appearance tended to carry as much symbolism as genetic connection. Resemblance between parent and the child might signify an intention toward creating ethnic or cultural continuity as well as the union of the child's parents. Heterosexual couples often sought their union and reflection in their children.

The New York State Supreme Court argued that assuming the mother's lesbian lover's name would not be in the child's best interests.

An ideological stress on planning and choosing children pervades the titles for organization, conferences and films on lesbian and gay parents. Lesbians and gay men. In this context, biological ties no longer appeared as a given but as something consciously created, with choice representing a necessary and structural condition of parenting for anyone engaged in nonprocreative sex.

By situating relationships between parents and child within the metaphor of choice that defines gay families.

Prospective parents applied the notion of choice to the entire context of making a decision to have children, including the division of childcare responsibilities. Very often individuals engaged in extensive discussions and interviews before selecting coparents or sperm donors.

The phrase "choosing children" also resonates with the variety of methods available for bringing children into one's life. Some gay men and lesbians would not consider parenting without a lover; others had elected to become single parents.

The long history of state intervention into relationships between lesbians, gay men, and their children has supplied ample reasons for them to approach parenting with a healthy regard for tactical considerations - custody battles are a major concern. Former spouses are the most frequent plaintiffs in child custody cases.

Many lesbians and gay parents portrayed their children not only as the products of considered reflection, but as beings who introduced commitment and planning and everyday life.

For all that Western societies have rooted kinship in a biological relatedness that invokes the act of heterosexual intercourse, becoming a genitor has long carried cultural undertones of creation and responsibility for another human being. Among the lesbians and gay men in the Bay Area who had incorporated children into their lives. Although gay families have proved capable of subsuming childbirth along with adoption.

By the time the lesbian baby boom entered the discourse on gay families, kinship in the United States could no longer be reduced to procreation or procreation to the image of differently gendered persons locked in heterosexual embrace.

# CHAPTER EIGHT: THE POLITICS OF GAY FAMILIES 195

Lesbian and gay parents are part of the "we" in families we choose but from a child's perspective the "context is going to be defined by having parents" ... "How can you knowingly saddle a child with the stigma of gay or lesbian parents".

The emergence of gay families represent a major historical shift, when viewed against the prevalent assumption that claiming a lesbian or gay identity must mean leaving blood relatives behind and foregoing any possibility of establishing a family of one's own, unless a person is willing to make the compromise of hiding out in a marriage of convenient . Given that homosexuality firmly allied with identity only at the end of the nineteenth century and that the major period of urban gay population growth.

Gay families exhibited some distinct advantages over both nuclear families and the unattainable ideal of a unified, harmonious gay community. Face-to-face relations give families we choose a fighting chance to encompass conflict and dissent without denying the difference that crosscutting identities can make or the divisions that can come between people.

Significantly, many lesbians and gay men in the Bay Area cited a relationship's ability to weather conflict as itself a sign of kinship. Flexible boundaries released chosen families from the genealogical logic of scarcity and uniqueness that, for example, would limit a child to one mother and one father.

Gay families are not intrinsically stratified by age or gender. Their capacity to continue to embrace former lovers represents another strength. Chosen families shed a different light on the issue of the alleged instability or *inconstancia* of gay couples. Opinions among both gays and heterosexuals remain divided as to whether lesbian and gay couples together. If the question is reformulated to take account of contemporary discourse on gay families, which allows a former partner to make the transition from erotic lover to non-erotic friend without alienating the kinship tie, one could make a good case that gay relationships endure longer on average than ties established through heterosexual marriage.

For every way in which families we choose seem to depart from hegemonic understanding of kinship.

Even within the relation that opposes straight to gay families, the "same" elements of blood and choice surface on both sides of the contrast between these "different" categories of kin.

## ASSIMILATION OR TRANSFORMATION? 197

In the absence of close attention to history and context, there is the constant temptation for a person to view phenomena new to her experience as a reflection, extension, or imitation of something she thinks she already knows.

Consider, then, the way most discussions of gay families have evaluated the political significance of laying claim to kinship as either inherently assimilationist or inherently progressive, without respect to social or historical context.

Since the gay movement of the 1970s, certain activists have contended that having no family should constitute a point of pride for gay people, or at least remain a distinguishing feature of being lesbian or gay.

We (gay men and lesbians) should 'develop' our own terminology to describe 'our' (presumably distinct) experiences, rather than adopting 'their' (heterosexual) language and institutions.

...

All this is not to say that discourse on gay families lacks a radical potential.

It is ironic that parenting, one of the phenomena within gay families ... there is also a radical potential associated with the one sense in which gay men and lesbians consistently concern themselves with reproduction in forming their own families.

There is also a radical potential associated with the one sense in which gay men and lesbians consistently concern themselves with "reproduction" in forming their own families. If "society" wants to define us as nonreproductive beings in the physical sense, why should we reproduce social arrangements that further the status quo? This double-edged usage of reproduction lends itself to a social critique that extends beyond gender and sexual identity to issues such as class which lie beyond the arena of concerns customarily attributed to gay people. 

Individuals from working-class backgrounds tended to experience coming out somewhat differently from others ... if they had determined to live openly as lesbians or gay men, they often perceived this not so much as declining to copy their parents lives.

Viewed through the timeless sort of chronology that reproduction represents, a family can be pictured as an endless chain in which each individual replicates, exceeds, or fails to attain "your grandparents have and your children will have after you." Gay families have not incorporated the chronological successions implicit in the Anglo-Europeans notion of genealogical descent.

Gay families, in contrast, have not incorporated the chronological succession implicit in the Anglo-European notion of genealogical descent. Although chosen families can incorporate biological symbolism through childbearing, the children raised in gay families are not expected to go on to become gay or to form gay families of their own.

## Common Ground

Gay families not only dispute procreative interpretations of kinship, but introduce a new basis for rendering heterosexuality and lesbian or gay identity commensurable. Put simply, two things that are commensurable are capable of being compared. In the context of the symbolic contrast between straight and gay families, kinship bridges the opposition of straight versus gay by providing a third term capable of relating each to the other.

To view gay identity as a species difference is to regard gay people as beings so separate and different in kind that many heterosexuals believe they do not know and have never met a lesbian or gay man. Stereotypes that reduce gay men and lesbians to sexual beings only reinforces this perceptions of utter otherness.

People in the United States tend to conceive commonality through a notion of humanity, and species membership through kinship more than other sorts of social bonds. In their narratives it is not the name of a captured soldier on identification papers, or even a glimpse of the eyes ... humanity.

The concept of humanity as a unified species is deeply rooted in the procreative bias of a culture that dissociates gay men and lesbians from family by defining them as nonprocreative beings. The notion of a species difference that divides gay from straight resonates with the strategic location of gay people outside the domain of kinship. A seemingly matter-of-fact situation such as walking into a building that two gay lovers call home can evoke a startled recognition reminiscent of the emotion felt by Terkel's veterans when enemy soldiers assumed human form in the context of familial relations.

Situated in relation to symbols like home that carry kinship, gay men and lesbians suddenly appear as social creatures rather than as self-absorbed. By advancing a claim to kinship, discourse on gay families bear the potential to break apart what Michel Foucault has called the "frozen countenance of the perversions" without discarding lesbians or gay identity in the process ...

Gay people aren't 'just like' heterosexuals. As a cultural category now linked to gay identity, kinship opens up new possibilities for relating gay to straight that shift discussion from tired rhetoric. In discourse on gay families, straight remains opposed to gay, the two identities distinct but rendered commensurable through the vocabulary of kinship. The product of this discourse need not be a humanism that dissolves difference into a larger whole.

## THE BIG PICTURE 205

Families constructed age and gender and organize inequitable divisions of labour, feminists have often been highly critical of 'the family'. In their works on kinship, they have warned of the twin dangers of ignoring power relations within families. 

Without doubt many travesties have been perpetrated in the name of family, including attempts to bar gay people from homes and workplaces across the United States. Because gay families are not structured through hierarchically ordered categories of relationship, however, they do not systematically produce gendered divisions. Such stratification is not incompatible with chosen families. Neither is hierarchy essential to the constitution of gay families. Where kinship terminology, it has not been marked by gender.

Families we choose interpose face-to-face relationships between what Bonnie Zimmerman has called the 'isolating structure' of identity. Does embracing gay families then mean abandoning all hope of resurrecting a notion of gay and/or lesbian community? Lesbian and gay activists have travelled a long road ... by the late 1980s even white activists situated in the most privileged of circumstances that not all LGBT have participated in this we.

There are problems raised by identity politics: people have a tendency to create ties with people they perceive to be 'like' them yet the families we choose offer novel possibility for healing some of the rifts and wounds left over from a painful decade of learning to deal in difference.

Because the relationship of lovers brings together two individuals united by the symbolism of sex and love, many in the United States have drawn analogies between this bond and more customary affinial arrangements. Due to this reasoning, coming out seems to make clearer statements about kinship.

If legal recognition is achieved for some aspects of gay families at the expense of others, it has the effect of privileging certain forms of family while delegitimating others.

## REENGINEERING BIOGENETICS 210

By identifying family with procreation, 'straight is to gay as family is to family' concedes the entire domain of kinship to heterosexuality.

In the absence of a notion of genealogy, [[David Schneider]] argued kinship would cease to have meaning as a cultural domain: we are robbed of its relation to biology, kinship is nothing. Families we choose are defined through contrast with biological or blood family, making biology a key feature of the opposing term that conditions the meaning of gay kinship. Biological family and chosen families are mutually constituted categories related through determinism that opposes free will to biogenetic givens.

LGBT have defined their families through contrast, defined by difference blood family and chose families assume equivalent status. Through fear of losing kinship, they lose the assumption that shared biogenetic substance in itself confers kinship.

The categories of gay kinship might better to be labelled families we struggle to create and struggle with - in a sense, people of all sexual identities 'work' to make kinship. Yet gay men and lesbians encounter added dimensions that complicate constructing kin ties: parenting children in a heterosexist society, maintaining erotic relationship without being one-dimensional, risking kinship ties in coming to straight relatives, interweaving peer relationship in multiples of three or four or seven.

The shift from identification of gayness with the renunciation of kinship to a correspondence between gay identity and a particular type of family presents a coming-out story.

Any attempt to evaluate the political implication must take into account Foucault's contention that power feeds upon resistance and knowledge upon its negation. Significantly, chosen families do not directly genealogical modes of reckoning kinship. They undercut procreation's status as a master term imagined to provide the template for all possible kinship relations. In displacing, discourse on gay families move obliquely toward, responding to hegemonic form of kinship, stepping aside to evade the paradigmatic blow..
