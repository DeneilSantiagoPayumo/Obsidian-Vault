# What makes people work?
## Article Introduction

### Vignette

What makes people work? The straightforward answer would be to live. This is not the answer offered by the **Andean** peasants whose lives I have studied.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

N/A - aside from to counter Western assumptions.

My question of anthropology focuses on the nature of work because it touches on a fundamental aspect of what it means to be human,

### How is the article organised?

N/A

### What are the key takeaways?

The argument: the question of what makes people work is a central feature of the way that human existence is understood within different cultural and historical repertoires and, following [[Graeber]], that a satisfactory understanding of the nature of work requires a broader understanding of value (?).

## Methods and Data Sources
### How was this data collected?

Fieldwork - ethnography in the Andean highlands of Northern Potosi (Bolivia).

### What, if any are the pitfalls behind how the data was gathered? Does the author address this?

N/A

### Special notes on the method chosen.

What does fieldwork mean? These Andean peasants were confused on what 'working' meant. The puzzlement on their face was patent when I responded that I was working. (139-140)

Fieldwork tends to be 24/7 

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Fieldwork

The practice of fieldwork is located in ethnography.

When meeting or greeting another, a brief formal meeting must be exchanged - what are you doing, where are you going? Typically, it is responded in spatial terms - I'm going up to the mountainside, to my fields.

"However, some activities that involve a commitment of energy, time and concentration are linguistically marked. One of the most important is ploughing, usually with a team of two bulls pulling a simple wooden plough, to open up the ground in March / April before it gets too hard with the winter frost, so it can be sown in September." (141)

This is a male activity. Women help guide the ploughs. When I would ask women what qualities they admired in  a man, they argued for "one that goes out to plough." For a man, it's a woman who can prepare a delicious meal.

"The uniformity with which people responded tin this way indicates that these are the quintessential activities of the married couple that forms the basis of the household: thee man ploughs and the woman feeds." (141) At the same time, the division of labour is an act of seduction, and the analogies between ploughing and copulation are widely recognised. This is also reflected in the Spanish loan-word *wapu* (*guapo*), used approvingly of male and women energy. In Spanish, *guapo* means pretty, or sexy, but in the Aymara of Northern Potosi the sexual connotations are expressed as an appreciation of a person's vitality. 

"At the same time, work is tough and hard (*ch'ama*) and endurance is at the heart of personhood and human virtue." 141

(141, for below, specified)

When men plough the fields and drink, they often cry that they are the bull of the hamlet.  Bulls seem to occupy the same semantic space as the feline serpent of Andean mythology. 

```ad-quote
title: 141
"Men become bulls in ritual, when they fight and when they plough, in aa kind of mimesis of the dangerous but potent mountainous landscape, which is the source of the meteorological forces that make life possible, but can also destroy it. Bulls and ploughing are the supreme human manifestation of the cosmic energy  that both revitalises and threatens, closely linked to the power of the ancestors which causes the crops to grow."
```

However, cooking is not described as *ch'ama*. The context people use that word is to evoke the toughness of rearing and bearing children. Rural women see their increasing numbers of children - what has been described as the 'materialisation' that has resulted from the decline in their productive activities in recent years.

"I eventually understood that the generic term for work in Spanish (*tabajo*) in Aymara refers exclusively to ploughing, not surprisingly, given the high value attached to this form of work. The appropriate response to questions about what I was doing ... was ...  'doing papers' (*papil lurkta*)." (142)

"One of the fundamental activities classed as 'making' or 'doing' (*lurana*) is weaving. Weaving is not *ch'ama*, but is the prototype act of creation, used as a root metaphor for many other forms of activity. Weaving and sewing enhance people's attractiveness. Young people work hard to produce new clothes for the main festivals ... In so doing they demonstrate that quality of being '*wapu*'. They also show that the wearer has been able to generate in other people - their spouse, but even more important their cross-sex siblings - the desire to help them dress well, the desire to be *wapu*, to use their energy creatively. (142)

There is an intrinsic link between work, relationship and consumption in Laymi communities. Before work is started ... It is always known for whom, or for what, the end product will serve.

It is striking for two reasons (p, 143-144):
1. "The peasants form part of an intensely hierarchical social world, and one in which they are severely exploited at times."
2. "Because it is not only work performed by people for the strengthening and nurturing of their own networks of social relations that is celebrated as a positive value, but also, and perhaps more importantly, work carried out as, and for, the collectivity of which they form part."

### Work as value

Much has been written about cooperative labour in the rural Andes. They focus exclusively on labour exchange than exchange of objects.

Some of these forms of labour exchange are inherently two-away (rather than merely prioritising the collective). They have a pragmatic function by distributing labour across households to cover major times of demand. There are also work parties attended by large numbers of people, parties with a festive atmosphere.

They are more festive when held by individual households for agriculture or house-building. Most phases of the agricultural cycle were organised in festive work-parties known as *chuqu*.

145

The more prosperous households with two or most adult members would actually organise a work party. The lands of widows were attended to by those present. People dressed up in their best clothes to go out to work together, and decorated the yoke of the plough with willow fronds. This is a severe departure from European history and literature where good clothes are reserved for good days.

"In my experience, it was not only the sociability and the sense of occasion that made work parties important to people, but also the work itself ... The *chuqu* work parties of Laymi hamlets do not operate in terms of strict calculation of debts and credits." (145)

Calculations of reciprocity are made far more strictly in the loan or gifting of objects in things. The difference lies in the understanding of ownership:

"Things are attributes of people ... The vitality of a landholding community, its capacity to make the earth bear fruit, is an expression of the deities that protect and succour life, but may also punish and kill - deities whose worship is articulated through the rituals of the landholding community. Agricultural work is a prime example of the continual flow of energies between deities and humans and, especially in the practice of collective work parties, it is part of this ritual complex." (146)

This commitment to collective and cooperative labour is what distinguishes 'real people' from the townspeople. When suggested that how they work is unfair, they responded that "the townspeople did not know how to work, that they felt sorry for them because they had no land, and that was why they wanted to help them." 

How is this uneconomic behaviour explained, especially as Bolivian peasants are among the poorest people in the Western hemisphere? Are they under false consciousness? Culturally programmed?

In this vein their own acts would demonstrate their own superior humanity.

Collective work is still seen as a burden, "but the performance of this obligation is also a virtue, the fulfilling of one's proper role in the universe." (147)

They are not culturally programmed to work harder - some people are seen as selfish for going to tend their fields when others are drinking and feasting, prioritising their own private interest over the need to attend to the well-being of the community through ritual. It's about the positive value of work.


### The Spectre of Coercion

This abstraction from the social context is of course a crucial aspect of the political economy - productive work as a source of wealth, productive work in general - forming the basis for [[Karl Marx]] 's development of the labour theory of value.

155

The Marxist concepts of abstract labour and the labour theory of value were developed with reference to the capitalist mode of production, as a means of explaining the mechanism by which the worker was alienated from the product of his/her labour and thereby exploited.

The problem with such approaches that chart the nature of exploitation in different social contexts is that they assume the values that served egalitarian functions remained operative through inertia.

More broadly, priority is given to exploitation and alienation. The problems of Marxist abstractions inspired a more nuanced theory of work.

## Conclusions

People believe work is hard. Work is a form of servitude. Rather, "the prevalence of slavery in the ancient world has infected Western ideas about work and personhood more profoundly than is recognised ... It seems that the opposition between freedom and coercion plays a foundational role in Western ideas about work. Any form of compulsion can be quickly assimilated to a condition of servility, insofar as it represents a partial limitations on freedom and thus on full personhood." (158).
