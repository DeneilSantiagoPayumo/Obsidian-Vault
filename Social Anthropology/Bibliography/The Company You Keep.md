## Introduction: The Company You Keep

### Vignette

When people say everything has changed, they point to a shift in how Americans think of the employer-employee relationship. That is the basic metaphor used for people to understand what it means to be a worker has changed.

People long believed that they brought capacities and skills into the workplace. However, in today's business world, they are to think about the services they provide - now people must think they own themselves as a business, a bundle of skills, assets and relationships that must be maintained and enhanced.

To be employable you must represent yourself as a business of one, willing to *temporarily* assist other, larger businesses. (2)

This metaphor has transformed the logic that determines employment relationships.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

When people think of themselves as metaphors, what does that mean? A start-up? A mom-and-pop shop? What do these metaphors mean in different contexts?

People never openly viewed themselves as rentable property or business although their language often implied this. It is still the underlying metaphor.


## Methods and Data Sources

### How was this data collected?

Ethnography.

Location was not chosen in advance - research support from different organisations and funding bodies determined where they would do this research.

This thus was studied in Stanford, traveling throughout the Bay Area. They interviewed everyone involved in the hiring process: people evaluating job applicants, hiring managers, recruiters, HR managers and more.

165 semi-structured interviews in which we discussed hiring and job-seeking strategies. The tech industry was studied, as well as temporary care-givers and lawyers. Start up companies were studied additionally.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Self as Property

Lets refer to [[John Locke]] - they used property as a key metaphor. To be free, you must have property.

[[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] wanted to understand why people would ever agree to have a king or boss. They answered that people are willing to trade some of their autonomy for security.

The definition of property has not stayed the same. Property was understood as something you have and could bring to the market. However, over time property stopped being understood as a unified thing and property is increasingly a bundle of rights (6).

How did the metaphor of self-as-property shape how people understood the employment contract? (8-9)
1. First there was an assumption of exclusivity built into this version of an employment contract ... This form of exclusivity eventually morphed into an ideal of company loyalty ... Employers wanted to make sure that they always had a ready supply of workers, and did so in part by encouraging employees to feel a sense of commitment and obligation to a company. 
2. Second, this metaphor implied that there was a sharp boundary between your work and your personal life. After all, when you quit working, from this perspective you were getting your "self" back, you were no longer on loan to your employer.

### Self as Business

What does this mean now? Many people talked about this change in terms of company loyalty. Now that companies no longer offered security in exchange for the worker's freedom (to switch jobs, company or careers), workers and employers had to develop new strategies.

Owning yourself as though you are a business is different than owning your self as though you are property in several important ways ... **when you are a business, you see yourself as a bundle of skills, assets, qualities, experiences, and relationships...** (12)

```ad-summary
title: paraphrased, on resumes, 12-13
If we are property, our resume is a straightforward list of our experiences and capacities: where we worked, and what we are capable of. A strategy to doing resumes is omissions: neglecting certain experiences that are not relevant. (p, 12-23)

Now, resumes are a marketing document. We are supposed to present the business solutions we have executed in the past, employ quantified details to tout the results. We might discuss business results.
```
 
```ad-quote
title: 15
(15) "When a resume is used under the metaphor that the self is a business, in a sense the resume is part of a negotiation in which two businesses are considering entering into an alliance ... the resume represents the self as a bundle of previously successful business solutions, but not just any random collection of business solutions. Because each business that is hiring presumably has a context-specific set of problems, an applicant is supposed to anticipate the specific problems that a business may be facing."
```

Being a bundle of skills changes what aspects of a person should be, will be managed. We can now measure how well someone is listening, or speaks French, or runs Photoshop. Abilities that don't seem inherently linked are lumped under a category that can be objectively evaluated. (16)

When people attempt career transitions, when their histories don't easily reveal their competence, it spawns a dilemma - workplaces themselves are not interchangeable. However, to switch jobs, the applicants must present him or herself as an internally consistent bundle. (p, 17)

Finally, when you switch from thinking of employment in terms of the self-as-property to self-as-business, you change the basic ideas about what an employment contract is in the first place ... when you are yourself a business, when you are hired, you are entering into a business-to-business contract with another business. Instead of getting a form of security, what you are trying to do is create a partnership that distributes responsibility and risk so that every business involved can maintain their autonomy as market actors. (17)

They are not just a business, but a business with a brand. The company and employee are responsible for ensuring that their brand does not harm the other.

We can see this have legal ramifications with businesses like Uber or AirBnB. They allow people to bring their assets to the marketplace, offering assets and driving skills. These companies insist that those providing the services through the platforms are not employees - they are only brokering the arrangement for mini-businesses. (p, 18)

Job applicants are increasingly seen as potential direct competitors for the companies who might hire them. This is a logical corollary if you start thinking of people as businesses. As a result, new categories of employees are increasingly being asked to sign non-compete clauses before a company is willing to hire them. (20)

People face new dilemmas under this metaphor of self-as-business - if the self is a bundle of skills, then aspects of the bundle will be valued differently by different people. Some will value skills over qualities or relationships, others will value relationships over skills. This has implications for the hiring of individuals: hiring managers may decide to hire someone within their social circle over evidence that the person has the skills required.

1. Valuing networks above all else meant overlooking skills or experience. 
2. People often have to make calculated choices about whether they are going to enhance their networks or enhance their skills. (22)

In the hiring process, because this bundle that makes up the self is in fact a complex and often uneven bundle, valuing one aspect - be it skills, experiences, qualities or relationships - over all else could put the selection process for job applicants and the actual workplace practices at odds with each other.
