### Home and Away, Mobility and Care in Botswana's Time of AIDS

## **A collection of key ideas**

### Background:

Background:
- Botswana faced one of the worst epidemics of HIV and AIDS for over 30 years
- International funding to help address them: free provision of treatment but has done little to curb the spread of HIV.
- A vast range of responses - a field of where economies and practices of care has been done, contested and negotiated.
- Aids deemed: "mobility is understood simultaneously to create and reflect social crisis, specifically in the form of family breakdown." (203)
- Progression of HIV through transport and migration, moving away from home for work and to return for care.

### A rethinking of what makes a place a home, family, intervention and epidemic

An examination of the ways in which spaces of care are produced and experienced by Tswana families:

#### The scattered places that constitute the Tswana *gae* (home) / *Ko Gae*: House and Home

Practices of movement: staying, calling and sending:
- Obligations to contribute to the family care
- For the Tswana, care, or *tihokomelo* is expressed in provision of specific things and work - food and cooking, cattle and care, money and its management, 'housing activities' - the refusal of which builds sentiments of love, care or jealousy.
- Care, understood thus, is emplaced ('housed'), but also produces space ('houses').
- These contributions of care differ significantly from those undertaken for close kin, and that those differences are also spatialised - care offered in wedding planning is tied to less frequent moving than that that characterises the *gae*.
- The infrequency of movement marks gradations of relatedness.

Familial space of care:
- The movement undertaken between lelwapa, moraka and masimo, Its temporalities create a space of care (courtyard, a cattle-post, lands).
- The *gae*, then, is a divided multiplicities, scattered, and yet bounded place, defined and integrated by the movement, staying, and care-work of kin ... the *gae* is the only place in which one nevertheless remains, and to which one is inevitably drawn back. (207-208).
- This movement simultaneously binds people and places together, and keeps them apart - articulating a tension between closeness and tension (208)
- When two people marry, they establish a new *gae*,.

#### *dikgang* - risks, conflicts and crises that arise out of home / Going Up and Down: Mending Ntate's Ways

Ntate - the grandfather of the family:
- By calling his grandchildren into the neighbour's yard, Ntate was behaving as if he was *of* that yard, had taken on its *dikgang*, and had assumed the role of disciplinarian there. (209-210)
- It was as though they decided to take the neighbour's children as his own, and treat his own children as if they were simply neighbours.
- The person the ethnography has bad feet - swelling, couldn't walk without pain: moved in ways that he shouldn't.
- Dalliances created a difficult *kgang* - imperative of movement meant that mobility was subject to close scrutiny. After he recovered, his distance was carefully reasserted - the necessity of maintaining distance meant that intimacy presents risks of dikang which distance ameliorates
- Spatiality of the *gae* ensured the balance between closeness and distance, and an appropriate ordering of people and places ... he was moving in the wrong times, for the wrong purposes. Mending Ntate's health involved mending his ways... (210-211)
- Management of *dikgang* was traced to neglect of ancestors, which had to be mediated and resolved. It was traced to neglect of ancestors or conflict between specific family members.
- Care ... is an ongoing object of crisis for the Tswana and the crisis it produces generates and sustains care in turn. (211)

#### A comparison of these insights that characterise governmental and non-governmental programmes of 'supplemental care' and how they invert kin spatiality / The Geographies of Intervention: Supplemental Care

Mpho's story:
- Lost her eldest daughter Kedi who left behind three daughters of her own that Mpho wanted to help raise
- Volunteers encouraged Mpho to register her two granddaughters as orphans so her family would get a food basket and help with cost of fees, transport and uniforms.
- Another NGO that ran counselling camps had been sent, then called into a meeting to be briefed about how the students would be sent on therapeutic retreats. She complained that they were never at home.
- In her journey, consistencies between spatiality of intervention program and kinship emerge: intervention enable movement, a place where care is taken, supplemental care designed to augment the care of families - the link between familial and supplemental care that makes disruption potent.
- NGOs establish bureaucratic boundaries that one could not access without referrals, proof of claims, registering and more ... houses have boundaries but limiting access to different spaces is a key means of ordering relationships ... where one member of the family can enter, as a client, and the others cannot, familial patterns of authority and responsibility are effectively suspended, and family relationships rendered meaningless. In this sense, we might see the boundary-making work of NGOs and government offices - like others of their spatial practices - as a process of creating an alternative, family-like space and set of allegiances by creating alternative sorts of boundaries. (214)
- Patterns of movement undertaken by agencies differ than those of kings .... movements in the *gae* is cyclical ... the organisations described produce and require centrifugal movement ... distinguishes government from NGOs not only from kin ... for whom the direction of movement agencies undertake are reminiscent of the problematic aimlessness of 'going up and down' (215)
- Agencies are compounded by these risks. The new risks they represented, I suggest, were not simply a matter of people being in the wrong places and the wrong times; they were linked to a spatiality of care that competed with and disrupted that of the family (216)

Summary: where are you in turn is a question of how are you. Both are subject to change and uncertainty. AIDS can be seen as discontent - the long-standing practices of managing space among kin to enable and produce care might be better-suited to addressing the epidemic than popularly assumed.
