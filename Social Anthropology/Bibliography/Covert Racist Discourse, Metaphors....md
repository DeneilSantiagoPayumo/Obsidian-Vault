Hill provides an incisive analysis of everyday language to reveal the underlying racist stereotypes that continue to circulate in American culture. provides a detailed background on the theory of race and racism reveals how racializing discourse - talk and text that produces and reproduces ideas about races and assigns people to them - facilitates a victim-blaming logic integrates a broad and interdisciplinary range of literature from sociology, social psychology, justice studies, critical legal studies, philosophy, literature, and other disciplines that have studied racism, as well as material from anthropology and sociolinguistics Part of the Blackwell Studies in Discourse and Culture Series

## A summary of the extract:

This extract will illustrate covert racist discourse that White people do not understand as racist but reproduce negative stereotypes of people of colour - Mock Spanish. The Author begins by outlining that "official" English has become the de facto for the Western world. The rejection of Spanish as a language reflects can be reflected in how in public notices, Spanish words are grossly misspelled, and how "A staple of anti-Spanish rhetoric .... makes "Americans" feel like aliens in their own country." (125)

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Mock Spanish: Covert Racist Discourse and Indexicality

Here, Mock Spanish is "a set of tactics that speakers of American English use to appropriate symbolic resources from Spanish" that "works to create a particular kind of "American identity", a desirable colloquial persona that is informal and easy going ... that assigns Spanish and its speakers to a zone of foreignness and disorder, richly fleshed out with denigrating stereotypes." (128-129)

Mock Spanish borrows Spanish-language words and suffixes, assimilates their pronunciation to English ... changes their meaning, usually to make them humorous or pejorative, and uses them to signal that the moment of English-language speech or text thus embellished is colloquial and informal." (134)

**One tactic:**
Semantic pejoration, Spanish words of neutral or positive meaning are moved down into a semantic space that ranges from the merely jocular to the deeply negative and insulting (134).

For example, "Adios" and "Hasta la vista" become insults and threats. The author scopes through various uses of "Adios", and how it appears in the meaning "Goodbye and good riddance".
Spanish-language terms of address and titles are useful as insults.
"Another widely used product of semantic pejoration is "nada" which in Spanish means simply, "nothing" but in Mock Spanish means "absolutely nothing, less than nothing." (136)

"Manana" which in Spanish means "morning" or "tomorrow" and need not connote procrastination or laziness, conveys only this pejorated sense in Mock Spanish. (136).

**Second tactic:**
"Spanish words that are insulting, lewd, or scatological in Spanish are substituted for vulgar English words. "Loco" for "crazy" dates from 1877 ... Scatology is illustrated in the use of the Spanish nursery word "caca" as a euphemism for English "shit". (137)

**Third tactic:**
This is to "add Spanish morphology, especially the definite article "el" and the suffix "-o" ... to English words." (138)

The "el ... -o" frame can be used for any reference that the speaker or writer wishes to locate within a jocular colloquial register, and suffixation with "-o" can proliferate through an utterance or text." (139)

**Fourth and final tactic:**
"The last major tactic for Mock Spanish is hyper anglicization and the closely related tactic of bold mispronunciation. All Mock Spanish tokens are anglicized; one cannot speak Mock Spanish except in a broad American English accent." (140)

We tend to boldly mispronounce Spanish accents in a parodic imitation, the staple of comedy routines but are visible racism.


### Indexicality and the Multiple Functions of Mock Spanish

Mock Spanish constructs a light, jocular, humorous stance and also constitutes an identity signalling that the speaker possesses a desirable colloquial persona that is peculiarly "American" *and* located Spanish as a language as marginal, disorderly and un-American. It reproduces negative stereotypes of the Spanish language  and it asserts control over the symbolic resources of Spanish, reshaping in the interest of Whiteness.

These functions are accomplished through "indexicality".

Indexicality is one of the three major relationships between the sign and its object. An indexical sign or index is grounded in its object, connected through it by proximity, contiguity or necessity. Iconic signs are grounded through resemblance.

Drawing from Silverstein, social indexicals are creative. It is important to distinguish referential indexicals from social indexicals - a particular language can function as a social indexical that signals an identity as "speaker of X" or "person from Y". Social-indexical functions can become objects of metapragmatic awareness where speakers develop views on appropriate usage and can discuss these.

The positive indexical function of Mock Spanish in creating a light stance is a vital skill that of someone that aspires to a prototypical American identity - for example, see Terminator 2: Judgement day.

"Through the use of Mock Spanish ... Terminator moves from being a machine, a symbol of fascist foreignness amplified by his German accent, to being a sympathetic protagonist who talks "the way people talk." (145)

Mock Spanish nicknames are an important index for a certain kind of American masculinity. George W. Bush is famous for giving nicknames to friends and subordinates "Pablo", "Camarones", "El Grande Jorge" and so on.

"Mock Spanish is available to convey a down-to-earth colloquial stance not only in everyday interactions, but in the highest levels of public life. Mock Spanish is always good for a laugh." (146)

### Mock Spanish and negative indexes of racist stereotypes and marginalization of Spanish.

People argue that Mock Spanish is a symbol of our diversity or of speaker's respect for Spanish language and culture.

"First, Mock Spanish associates the Spanish language irrevocably with the non-serious, the casual, the laid-back, the humorous, the vulgar. "Spanish" is available for joking and for insult; it cannot lend gravitas or sophistication." 

The author uses an example - Mock German with "Das Keyboard" with the "Das" conveying fine engineering whereas it would be unimaginable to call a keyboard "El Keyboard."

"Mock Spanish, with its relentlessly anglicized and even hyperanglicized and boldly mispronounced phonology and pidgin grammar, assigns native Spanish fluency to the realm of the "un-American." To pronounce Spanish place names or the names of public figures with any approximation of native Spanish-language phonology is to risk being accused of being stuffy, effete, p.c., even ridiculous."

"Another indication that Mock Spanish indexes racist stereotypes is that it often appears accompanied by highly stereotypical and offensive images of "Mexicans."

Mock Spanish, with its neglect of Spanish grammar and distancing from Spanish phonology creates a linguistic space for "orderly disorder" - orderly as it is part of a larger, cultural order where Spanish has been assigned a non-serious function and disorderly because it loses its grammatical constraints."

English speakers believe and pride themselves on knowing a little Spanish. This sense of empowerment over Spanish among Whites contrasts with the most acute anxiety among Spanish speakers about English as documented by Urciuoli. His respondents believed that they must never mix the two languages, that even a slight Spanish accent in English is discreditable, and that to code-switch by using Spanish and English expressions in the same sentence ... suggests ignorance of English.

Finally, the connotations conveyed by the semantic pejoration of Mock Spanish vocabulary items constantly reproduce and reinscribe vulgar racist stereotypes of the Spanish language and people of Spanish heritage. To find "manana" entertaining, one must have access to the stereotypes of laziness. For "adios" and "hasta la vista" to function as brush-offs or hostile threats, one must have access to the stereotypes of treachery and duplicity.
