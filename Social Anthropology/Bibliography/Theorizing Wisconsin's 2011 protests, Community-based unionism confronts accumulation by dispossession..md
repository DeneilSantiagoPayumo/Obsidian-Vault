2011 Wisconsin Protest

# Theorizing Wisconsin's 2011 protests: Community-based unionism confronts accumulation by dispossession.

## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Recent waves of social-movement protest in Wisconsin challenge conventional understandings of labour activism, as they have responded not only to rollbacks of labour rights but also to privatization of state programs and resources and budget cuts that target poor and working families. Drawing from participant-observation, I explore the question of whether the movements that arose in Wisconsin in early 2011 represented an expansion of union-based activism struggling within the "expanded reproduction" of capital or a broader struggle against what New Enclosures Movement scholars have conceptualized as capital's ongoing primitive accumulation strategies. I examine the implications of the answer to this question for community-based labour movements in Wisconsin and beyond.

State capitol in early spring of 2011 - support for unions - newly elected Republican governor unveiled bills targeting public-sector employees collective bargaining rights coupled with harsh spending rights.

What kind of alliances was emerging in the upper Midwest? What kinds of social movements did the policy regimes of neoliberalism give rise to?

Were the movements to protect union rights and livelihoods stripped by austerity? Are we all in it together, spilling across the boundaries of union membership?

Wisconsin:
1. Home to two political heroes, Bob LaFollette and Joe McCarthy
2. Less than 2 percent of state's GDP derives from agriculture and forestry
3. Deindustrialization - manufacturing peaked 1970s, power of unions
4. Corporations created global chains, chafed at paying taxes, cutting government programs, reducing tax burdens...

title: On the regime of accumulation (9)
collapse: closed
This is not just an isolated empirical point but speaks to shifts in what regulation theorists call the "regime of accumulation."7 Following Antonio Gramsci, these theorists use the idea of such a regime to talk about the relationship between production and consumption in an economy at a given historical moment. A regime of accumulation includes norms about how work is organized; financial rules; management practices; accepted principles about how income should be divided among wages, profits, and taxes; consumption norms; and related patterns of demand. The regime of accumulation that fascinated Gramsci was Fordism. Everyone knows that Henry Ford introduced the $5-, eight-hour day in 1914. He understood that for his company to sell cars, workers were going to have to have enough income to buy them and enough leisure to use them. He kept this approach, even through the worst of the Depression. During the massive labor mobilizations of the 1930s, this vision of how the fruits of labor should be distributed was a powerful part of workers' ideas about how the world should be organized and what was fair.

5. Wage growth, new societal consensus on how income should be shared: mass production, rising productivity based on economies of scale, increased profits and investment...
6. Services now lifeblood of Wisconsin economy
7. Power of public sector jobs
8. "Purple state" - polarized

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Overview of the protest

Wisconsin - Scott Walker - proposed moderate set of proposal. Then, not deficit in current budget and little long-term deficit. Then, he gave 137 million in tax breaks to corporations and made the state's Department of Commerce a public-private hybrid funded by taxpayers and passed an order limiting lawsuits against corporations. Then, released the Budget Repair Bill, calling out the National Guard and had nonfiscal items - evisceration of collective bargaining, day care workers, public-sector unions...

Caused an uproar from many public sector jobs.
Democrats left the chambers to make it impossible for the senate to vote on the bill.
Schools closed, people rallied at the capitol.
Demonstrators formed a utopian village: free food, organised recycling. Kill the bill.
A blogger from western New York pretended to be a donor, David Koch. Walker claimed that he was in the pocket of big money and that his ambitions were determined by interests out of state.

Order for police to clear the Capitol of protestors. They refused, and they called in State Highway Patrol. Protestors agreed to leave.

Focus of protests shifted from defence of labour rights to a broader resistance to the politics of austerity - using budgetary distress to demand concessions from the poor and working classes.

Protestors were angry: state's open meetings law - movement to general strike, but no experience mounting one, put resources for eight republican senators into the campaign for the April election of a labour-friendly state Supreme Court justice.

### Fighting for labour rights

Labour struggle - perception of media attacks that the governor and Republican legislators unleashed on public-sector workers. Dead weight. Dependent. Right-wing think tanks: studies claiming to show that they are overpaid compared to private-sector counterparts.

Public-sector employment represents a complicated site of labor struggle, because the employer is the state. But Governor Walker did not target or address workers as their employer - he did not, for example, instruct the public agencies that were the direct employers of public workers to demand contract concessions. Rather, the governor sought to legislate change in the rules of the game - to take away workers' rights that had been conferred by the state and to change the rules by which their unions could legally exist and function. This was not a direct struggle between capital and labor (although the governor's corporate backers certainly approved) as much as it was a contest over rights fought on the more universal ground of citizenship.

The fact that the governor was changing the rules of the game made the struggle relevant to all workers. Card-carrying public-sector union members, mainly of AFSCME, SEIU (Service Employees International Union), AFT (American Federation of Teachers), MTI (Madison Teachers Inc.), and WEAC, were only a small proportion of the crowds who turned out for the protests. Members of private-sector unions showed up in even larger numbers, including the Teamsters, Steelworkers, UFCW (United Food and Commercial Workers), LIUNA (Laborers' International Union of North America), IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers), and Pipe Trades. These groups articulated a politics of solidarity that saw the governor's and legislature's actions as eroding the legal ground and the rights on which all unions stood. The rights and rules in question gave workers the ability to negotiate with their employers collectively rather than individually and gave them a voice in shaping their conditions of labor. They represented the protective covering of social institutions, in Polanyi's words, won by previous generations.

### Fighting the austerity budget

Over the US, corporate interests have been pushing back against unions - generating extreme wealth disparities.

These issues brought to the struggle groups that had worked against the earlier dismantling of welfare in the state as well as a broad array of antipoverty groups and advocates for children, the elderly, and the disabled. Given the distribution of poverty in Wisconsin, this increased the racial diversity of the movement.

...

The budget and related legislation targeted services that went beyond the safety net for the poor, elderly, and disabled; it also dismantled many programs that were part of everyday functioning in working-class and middle-class communities. The budget cut public school allocations deeply - by nearly a million dollars. It gave health insurers in the state a bonus by not requiring them to cover certain expensive conditions such as autism, cochlear implants, or end- stage renal disease, and it allowed them to exclude family planning services. Legislation abolished public transit authorities, which were of special significance to the poor but on which a broad swath of the population relied. It sharply cut recycling programs, cut funds for rural Internet expansion, and made it illegal to test drinking-water qualities.

Then, budgets towards privatization of schools.

This kind of privatization, like the tax cuts with which Walker had started off his term in office, raised questions for the public about corporate dominance of state politics and growing inequality. The use of epithets like "welfare queen" and "slob" against public-sector workers had dramatized that, from the point of view of the corporate elite, black or white, low- waged or on welfare, the bottom 90 percent of the state's population looked pretty much the same.

### Community-based unionism

```ad-quote
title: 15
The struggles against the "primitive accumulation" measures of budget cuts and privatization and the "labor battle" against restrictions on collective bargaining took place in a single political field - they shared a temporal, geographic, and social space, and protagonists presented their case using a single rhetorical frame. For the governor and the legislature, this frame could be summarized by the governor's twin slogans: "Wisconsin Is Open for Business" and "Wisconsin Is Broke."
```

```ad-quote
title: 16-17
Even though the labor movement has never used these terms, this shift could be interpreted as recognizing that labor's moments of struggle are always a response to capital's primitive accumulation strategies. Collective bargaining (when it does not break down), European- style corporatist innovations in training, and Japanese "co-management" strategies may qualify as examples of labor negotiating within the sphere of capital's expanded reproduction. (They also represent, in many cases, a protective institutional framework won in previous battles with employers.) But moments of struggle and protest always signal a breakdown of the "ordinary run of things," which occurs when the "ordinary run" has pushed labor's exploitation too far or when capitalists perceive the existing arrangements to pose an obstacle to the accumulation process.)

The social reproduction of labour is never separate from labour issue:
	"social reproduction refers to the labour necessary to keep households and communities functioning and to allow them to send productive members out into the world.  It includes the activities that reproduce and support individuals from day to day, from year to year, and across generations. We often gloss social reproduction as unpaid domestic labor and child care, but it can also include tax-financed garbage removal and schools and the commodified work of nursing assistants, day care workers, and police officers. As noted, a large proportion of all public-sector employers contribute to social reproduction in the sense that they support the next generation of laborers; care for the ill, the disabled, and the retired; and equip the current generation of workers with what they need to make it out the door each day. The struggle to secure the conditions of social reproduction has always been intertwined with the struggle for higher wages, as workers develop historically and culturally specific arrangements for converting their pay into the goods and services needed to survive. (17)

The strongest of societies oppressed and exploited to mobilize those who cannot obtain self-mobilization.

I am arguing here that this theoretical understanding of the unity of the politics of the workplace and the politics of the living space, or community, informed and shaped the 2011 social movement in Wisconsin. The names of many of the organizations formed to support the movement emphasize this unity of struggle: We Are Wisconsin, United Wisconsin, Defend Wisconsin, Voices of Solidarity, Wisconsin Wave. As these names represent a rhetorical effort to claim majority status, they also make the point that "we" are all in this together. I am not arguing that Wisconsin protesters are wiser than the average in figuring this out - it is something that many social movements throughout the history of capitalism and around the world have understood. In fact, the idea that labor is separate from the rest of society has only found expression at a few moments and in a few models. It is there in guild unionism and the U.S. labor movement's idealized and flawed vision of its postwar accord with industry. And it is there in Marx's theoretical formulation of how the capital accumulation process operates - but never in his historical examples (Sayer 1987).

Capitalist's use of primitive accumulation is not unique to the neoliberal era. What is unique about our experiences is the singlemindedness and effectiveness of the corporate assault - coherent agenda, wealth through corrupt practices, new abilities.

"The presence of labour federations committed to a community-based labor movement and a dense network of grassroots groups have made possible a response that draws together all those affected by the diverse right-wing projects undertaken in the name of "opening Wisconsin for business.  This recognition implies the need for unity between groups targeting labor rights and those concerned more broadly with securing resources for social reproduction."  (18)
