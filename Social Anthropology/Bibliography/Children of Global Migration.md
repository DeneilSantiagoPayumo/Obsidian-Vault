>In the Philippines, a dramatic increase in labor migration has created a large population of transnational migrant families. Thousands of children now grow up apart from one or both parents, as the parents are forced to work outside the country in order to send their children to school, give them access to quality health care, or, in some cases, just provide them with enough food. While the issue of transnational families has already generated much interest, this book is the first to offer a close look at the lives of the children in these families.

>Drawing on in-depth interviews with the family members left behind, the author examines two dimensions of the transnational family. First, she looks at the impact of distance on the intergenerational relationships, specifically from the children’s perspective. She then analyzes gender norms in these families, both their reifications and transgressions in transnational households. Acknowledging that geographical separation unavoidably strains family intimacy, Parreñas argues that the maintenance of traditional gender ideologies exacerbates and sometimes even creates the tensions that plague many Filipino migrant families.

## A summary of the book:

This book, as opposed to the other ethnographies, do not have a central narrative.
As a result I will outline all seven chapters and their conclusions:

**The Global Economy of Care** - this chapter introduces the concept that families are forced to work abroad due to problems with Filipino export-led growth. To provide for their children, families form transnational families where a parent goes abroad to earn money in Western countries. This extraction of care as a resource allows richer countries to ignore the problems of low wages, insufficient employee benefits whilst denying poorer countries the care resources needed for their own country.

**The Dismal View of Transnational Households** - non-governmental organizations tend to lobby for nuclear families, viewing it as the perfect means to support children. That said, this ignores the problem of the nuclear family and reinforces gender boundaries. Even despite the abundance of transnational families, various institutions pressure for the nuclear family: removing support for the families of migrant mothers. This creates a gender paradox: "the operation of gender conventions works against the families of migrant mothers ... these same gender conventions, paradoxically, enable the empowerment of a particular group of women and promote the disempowerment of some men." (55) - women with father-away families gain status to be visible, fathers in mother-away families are nowhere to be found.

**Caring for the Family** - this chapter discusses how people manage and fulfil their gender-ascribed role as leaving abroad for the family. "Fathers leave so as to fulfil their gender-ascribed role as breadwinners of the family while mothers are only justified in leaving when they have been denied their right to a breadwinner." (66). Women transgress gender norms by leaving, men don't and thus mothers must do more work to show that they love their children.

**The Gap Between Migrant Fathers and Their Children** - this chapter discusses the problems that arise with father-away families - children do understand that their families are not conventional, and do not experience a breakaway of familial ties. However, this is only possible if the mother provides extra work to cover the work that the father has left behind.

**The Gender Paradox** - absent fathers do minimal care work whereas martyr mothers mourn in the process, giving a picture of a mother wanting more to be at home than earning a living. This encourages daughters to take on housework that their mothers have left behind, and extended kin to pick up their slack. Fathers, at the expense of women, pass on caregiving responsibilities of children to other women. This creates the paradox: migration increases women's income power and places them away from the domestic sphere, but disempowers them by recreating conventional gender ideologies.

**Gendered Care Expectations** - Gender shapes the problem of transnational families, "children who in fact receive ample care may still view themselves as receiving "not enough" care, only because the caring work in their families is not done directly by their biological mothers." (140). The community must come together to help ease these problems of the transnational families.

**CONCLUSION: The Persistence of Gender**
Gender plays a big role in shaping transnational family dynamics. 
Globalization engenders the formation of transnational families and leaves the average family in the Philippines without an adequate supply of either public or private care resources (162).
Entry restrictions for migrants also stop transnational families from being reunited - see the Labour Certification Program in the United States that force children that are left behind in the Philippines to not join.
Transnational families invite the reconstitution of gender relations. To have a successful transnational family, you must alter your gender ideology. Migrant fathers must be nurturing and sensitive, mothers must learn how to discipline youths.
Women tend to do more of the work in father-away  and mother-away families - the work of men tends to narrow in its scope while the work of women expands.

### A collection of key ideas from the text

#### How different social norms dictate expectations of gendered behaviour

```ad-quote

"In the Philippines, the division of labour between fathers and mothers is made crystal clear by metaphorical references to men as *haligi ng tahanan*, "the pillar of the home," and women as *ilaw ng tahanan*, "the light of the home" (57)
```
##### How being the 'breadwinner' informs identities

*Chapter Three*

Conventional gender norms characterise fathers as breadwinners. This, in turn, influences their justification for leaving the family and also changes the activities they do when they stay.

```ad-quote
"Expected to be a "good provider," men migrate in order to fulfil their masculine role of extending material provisions to the family ... the employment of wives and mothers is equated with the failure of men to be "good providers". As I noted, men often leave so as to earn sufficient wages to build homes or send their children to good schools ... support a stay-at-home mother." (61)
```

This expectation of being the breadwinner shapes why they would leave. Parreñas draws on Caridad's story - the father had to leave to fulfil his duties as a breadwinner, the securement of masculinity only possible with these wages. Migrant fathers also left to pursue their careers, a choice rooted in an implication that this work allows fathers to provide for the family.

*Chapter Four*

Migrant fathers, perhaps because no social expectation is imposed on them, rarely communicate with their children. When they do, they take on an instrumental role model by reprimanding their children from a distance. This inevitably creates an emotional gap.

By having this finance, fathers can provide from a distance, giving finance to build homes. "The process of building the home allows children to witness the mobility that migration affords their families." (70).

That said, when they come back, "migrant men take over some of the family work of women whenever they are at home in the Philippines ... emotionally distant labour of cooking and cleaning." Parreñas notes that this may be because of "the awkwardness imposed by the effects of geographical distance and minimal communication between them." (71).

This inevitably leads to unfamiliarity with the children. Parreñas uses the story of Ton-ton Illano,  suggesting that unfamiliarity imposes a gap of inhibition, leading to children being less likely to share their problems with their fathers. (74).

To make up for their intense distance, fathers tend to enforce their authority in the household - "fathers may also feel pressure to act with authority ... they impose disciplinary standards that do not take into consideration the habits already formed by their children." (77).f

Because of this, women must work overtime to ease the gap between fathers and their children - intensive mothering allows the two to make connections. They must tell the men what's been going on, and tell the children what the men has been doing. Women must thus discipline and incorporate masculine identities.

##### How being the 'nurturer' informs identities

*Chapter Three*

```ad-quote
"In the Philippines, mothers can participate in the labour force, but not to the extent that this participation would dislodge the ideal of separate spheres. They can be breadwinners only if when doing so they do not undermine their role as the proper nurturers of the family." (59)


```

Women, in this light, are constructed as reluctant breadwinners: those who want to be with their children, recognise the right of men to be breadwinners, and work for economic reasons. Gender also determines how money is spent - money made by working mothers are also characterized as supplementary breadwinners. The women here face dual responsibilities as a result. 

Mothers migrate as, in the view of the children, they are left with no other choice but to migrate. Parreñas uses the sto0ry of Rodney Palanca, stressing his words in that "She did not have a choice," (63). They must either be nearing poverty, must need opportunities to provide for the family or otherwise. When they are not, they are implicated as giving 'greater priority to herself than to her family' (64).

*Chapter 5*

```ad-quote
"According to children, fathers do not perform much caring work in the transnational family of migrant mothers ... men forgo the physical caring responsibilities that migrant mothers surely cannot perform due to their geographical distance by passing this work onto other women in the family." (98)
```

The inability of men to do care work hurts children - children are afraid to burden mothers with their emotional needs, and keep their problems to themselves.

Men tend to 'relocate to another area of the Philippines and in the process completely avoid the possibility that women's work would become part of their daily routine of family life ... pass[ing] it onto other women' (101). They seem to reject the reconstitution of gender in the family.

Additionally, mothers 'not only reconstitute mothering by providing acts of care from afar, but also often do so by overcompensating for their physical absence and performing a transnational version of what Sharon Hays identifies as "intensive mothering"' (103)

Parreñas uses Cheryl's story (104) as an example: her mother contributes a large share to their household income and is more involved than her father, constantly calling, planning their menus, teachers and more. This establishes intimacy.

That said, mothers tend to 'overact' their performance - acting as a 'super mom', meaning that children:

```ad-quote
'easily develop the unrealistic view that mothers have a natural inclination to always shower them with acts of love ... as a result of their unrealistic gender expectations, in general children resist the reconstitution of mothering initiated by migration, reject the flexibility of allocating some of their mother's conventional duties to other members of their family ... and finally expect their mothers to be their primary nurturer despite all their financial support.' (106)'
```

Mothers became 'martyrs', discussing their eternal suffering at being separated. This image makes children 'find comfort in their mother's grief over not being able to nurture them directly' which inevitably 'naturalizes the maternalism of women.' (108).

This in turn socialise elder daughters to work and provide for their family domestically, the pattern of gender against its reconstitution creating reproduction.

We can also see the extension of care in the names children give to their female kin - mother, mama, nanay, mommy. Female kin are frustrated and burdened by these duties - 'In assisting migrant mothers, female extended kin bear the brunt of persistent gender inequalities that free men of household work and in the process they perpetuate the responsibilities bound to them.' (115) Cultural expectations dominate their lives.

*Chapter 6*

Children struggle with the transnational family falling outside traditional familial norms - Parreñas uses the story of Roan who had a close-knit family, his aunt taking ana ctive role in parenting, walking him to school and more but still not being enough for him 'because of Roan's belief that his aunt would naturally perform acts of mothering with less emotional attachment than his mother ... must just be naturally be better performed by his mother.' (122)

Children assume that the division of labour is natural and expect mothers to performs of the most intensive mothering. Parreñas uses the story of Rosette who longed for her mother to intensively mother her, pointing that 'the longing for such moments ... suiggests that what are easily overlooked ... gestures of affection in everyday life ... are starkly absent in the lives of the children.' (123)

Children do not recognise the economic contribution made by mothers as a form of care as it steps outside gender boundaries. They refuse to accept a reconstituted form of mothering.

Children are more prone to feelings of abandonment. "It is not only a nuclear family that children are denied in migration, but more significantly the greater familiarity that one could only achieve from moments of togetherness." (126). Partly because they spend less time together, children of migrant mothers are likely to hold feelings of abandonment compared to their fathers - the double standards of care expectations. Fathers can send them money and calls but mothers must always remain intimate.

Mothers take the pressure of economic contributions and remind the children of it extensively - as with Rodney Palanca, where the narrative of his own mother suffering was used to encourage him to study. "The reduction of the mother-son relationship to a commodity exchange is reflected in the infrequency of her visits." (132

#### How the problems of transnational families can be eased:

##### In father-away families:

Several things must happen:
1. Children must recognise that migration is done for the collective good of the family
2. "Mothers [must] use their position as intergenerational brokers to prevent possible misunderstandings between migrant fathers and children" (80).
3. Fathers must involve themselves in the lives of these children, notably gaining results when fathers demonstrate softer qualities of care.
4. "Migrant men who perform distance fathering and do so by incorporating maternal acts of caring and nurturing are more able to ease the gap in transnational families." (80)
##### In mother-away families:

Several things must happen:
* Firstly, you can maintain emotional security by relying on the maintenance of gender - assuring children of their mothers' love.
* You can also cooperate with community and kin: fathers can take on nurturing responsibilities, kin can speak cooperatively of the mothers, hold them less accountable and more.
* Some children may be traditionalists and prefer to stay in the country and work with their family, some 'realists' may accept this and know that they too ma leave to work. They are a minority. (137)
* Influential members of the community could help these children adjust to these lives and validate their existence and place the families within these norms.
* Support groups can help adjust children to their lives
* Fathers could assist children with dealing the migration of mothers and help them accept mothering.

#### Problems with how the state governs migrant lives:

*Chapter 1*

Care inequalities trouble the economic landscape. The lack of care resources in the Philippines results from 'care resource extraction' - the withdrawal of care from poor to rich nations.

These families form as: "first through the exhaustion of state care resources by structural adjustment policies that mandate the servicing of the foreign debt and second via the depletion of the labour supply of care workers from the global south as they move to the global north." (14)

The Philippines has incurred debt and is trying to pay it off to obtain the IMF's seal of approval. But the government isn't close to doing that. In exchange for SAP (structural adjustment program) loans, the Philippines was forced to open its doors to g;obal competition through the development of export industries to the cheap manufacturing of cheap goods. Also, the Philippines (to gain IMF access) had to rely on export-orientated industrialization and purchase goods in foreign markets.

This meant that:

```ad-quote
"First, the economy's only basis of competition in the global economy is low-wage labour. Second, the power that foreign direct investors posess to dictate production limits the coutnry's ability to diversify its products in order to provide goods that would generate revenue sufficient to purchase imports. Third, having to patronize the products and services of lending countries places the nation in a position of unequal dependency." (16)
```

Deregulation and restructuring has increased the vulnerability of the average Filipino worker.

On another note, migration allows workers to gain funding to raise their children or access quality health care, pay for good schools and access new opportunities.

Thus, care is now the largest imported product of the Philippines. 

```ad-quote
"The export of care is a legacy of colonialism as it maintains an infrastructure of unequal dependency between the Philippines and richer nations in the global economy ... dictated by the demands of the global north. (24)"
```

The global north thus does not see the point of investing in nursing professionals and passes the responsibility of the global south, making taxpayers invest in the education of labourers who then leave.

*Chapter 7*
The overlooked second generation create a hole in U.S. immigration laws. Let's look at the Immigration Act of 1965.

Parreñas uses the story Sharon, a mother who provided enough money to let her children come with her to the US, and her daughter Ellen who was too old and not considered a child, meaning that she needed to qualify for entry as an unmarried adult child - that she has to wait six more years to receive a visa.

```ad-quote
"Many minor children fall through the cracks in qualifying for higher preference categories because the age of the dependent child is determined on the moment of consideration of her petition, not on the day of filing. Therefore, a child petititoned by her migrant mother at the age of seventeen would be ineligible for immediate family reunification if the backlog extended the processing of visa applications past the year of higher eligibility." (146).
```

The author links this to the economy - the U.S doesn't need migrants, and thus closes their borders. As the demand for labour decreases, nativism kicks in to blow the flow of Asian in the country (sentiments of hostility).

```ad-quote
"The parents of most of the children I met had not been skilled workers in the United States. Thusm they did not qualify for an H1-B visa. Instead, most were low-wage service workers caught in the legal tangle of remaining 'out of status ... to obtain immigrant status via the Labour Certification Program, Sharon Seneriches had to wait seven years to receive her green card. During this time, her children - in limbo as well - also waited, with the hope that their mother would receive legal status before they became too old and thus ineligible to join her in the United States. (147-148)


```

The author uses Jeek's story (153) to explain the difficulty of having no parents - emotional insecurity, no outlet to process his feelings, He felt abandoned and felt that he was not able to concentrate on his studies enough. His story, like other children, reflects the inadequacy of kin relations.

```ad-quote
"Nativism ... is at work in this process, because backogs are more likely to affect the most representative migrant populations ... the families of migrant workers still often find themselves forcibly separated and disqualified from receiving the benefits that their working members have earned." (159)
```
