This paper responds to the challenge to conceptualize political activity through temporal as well as spatial perspectives, and does so by means of a discussion of the different temporalities experienced by union and social movement activists. It is based on fieldwork with activists from two public sector workers' unions in Buenos Aires and residents and street vendors' organizations in the city of El Alto, Bolivia. I discuss two coexisting temporalities, or social experiences of time (Munn): 'historical time', a sense of emplacement within a historical narrative of political action that looks back to the past and to illustrious ancestors and forwards to an imagined set of possibilities for the future; and 'attritional time', one of constant protest or negotiation, the continuance of the day to day of political life when there is no resolution in sight to a particular conflict or problem, coupled occasionally with a dramatization of what can become quite banal over time. Finally, I discuss a kind of event-based mediation between different temporalities, specifically revolution as a clash or meeting of attritional time and historical time, coexisting but separately experienced temporalities. This mediation involves both the revolutionary actions themselves and the practices of hailing, both contemporaneous and retrospective, which include scholarly research as well as other forms of social commentary. I suggest that this hailing might be in part enacted through a promise or assertion of discontinuity and rupture in the flow of time (Harris), even when events may not have been experienced as such at the time itself. Thus, different social experiences of time meet in a politics of time, to co-construct kairos, or revolution.

Argentine unionists, especially in ATE, experience historical time as participation in a historical narrative, with a relatively coherent version of the past as a flow of time divided into epochs or periods and punctuated by particular events and people. That time flows to the future, but the future is indeterminate; albeit one that is most likely to consist of continued struggle, even if it might be one that is constructed through prefigurative practices in the present. Here, historical time meets the second kind of time I proposed, namely attritional time, which is a kind of continuity. That continuity contains within it the constant possibility of discontinuity or rupture (the kairos within chronos). The point of rupture is the point at which attritional time meets and constructs historical time. That said, actual desire for rupture may in practice be more that of outside commentators (including myself) than of the activists.

There are specific practices of mediating the different temporalities: for example, in historical time, practices of protest and commemoration make the past present, in daily life and in political protest. Historical time is experienced through the telling of the linear, flowing yet punctuated narrative, for the purposes of training new delegates or enlightening a researcher; but also through more cyclical practices of commemoration. People are made into icons and ways of bringing the past into the present through imagery in offices, at demonstrations, in naming practices, the everyday use of Per√≥n's sayings, the study of his speeches, posting and viewing them on YouTube, showing them to new recruits, repeating the story of recuperation, of the union's path to health, and so on. All these are acts of making historical time present. What I have called attritional time is lived through repetition of political activity, political arguments, rhetorical strategies, visual and mobilizational practices such as demonstrations, assemblies, and so on.

Finally, this paper has also discussed a kind of event-based mediation between different temporalities: specifically, revolution as clashing or meeting of attritional time and historical time. The processes of this kind of mediation involve both the revolutionary actions themselves and the practices of hailing that are both contemporaneous and retrospective. Tentatively, I want to propose that this hailing might be enacted through a promise or assertion of discontinuity and rupture, even when events may not actually have been experienced as such at the time itself. Anthropologists and historians, as well as other social commentators, are complicit or even necessary participants in these hailing processes, which reveal much about 'our' own social experience of time. Thus, different experiences of time meet in a politics of time, to co-construct kairos , or revolution.
