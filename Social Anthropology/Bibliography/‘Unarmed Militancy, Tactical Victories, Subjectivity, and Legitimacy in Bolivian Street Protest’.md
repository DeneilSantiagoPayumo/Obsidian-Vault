# ‘Unarmed Militancy, Tactical Victories, Subjectivity, and Legitimacy in Bolivian Street Protest’
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Moments of intense physical confrontation between protesters and security forces have become iconic parts of political protest. These asymmetrical tactical encounters have been pivotal to successful Latin American revolts against neoliberalism and regime-displacing protest movements. Based on ethnographic engagement and oral history interviews with Bolivian activists in Cochabamba and La Paz, this article characterizes an overlooked tactical stance: _unarmed militancy_, which I define as the use of forceful, combative tactics that are nonetheless qualitatively less damaging than those of their (usually state) adversaries. Unarmed militants complicate the binary of violence and nonviolence often used to strategize and analyze protest. Unarmed militants claim some of the moral purity of nonviolence and of those victimized by state repression. Yet, they also physically fight back to hold physical space and interrupt daily life. Neither provocateurs nor extremists, unarmed militants collaborate in achieving the tactical and strategic goals of mass mobilizations. This article examines the material processes of on-the-street collaboration, the subjectivity of demonstrators, the narratives surrounding protest, and the moral understandings of just and unjust uses of force as elements that can make unarmed militancy effective. [_political legitimacy, tactics, protest, repression, revolution_]

There was a series of protests in January, February and April 2000. The water-privatization contract and the rate hike gave people among class lines to fight together..

Fathers defending irrigation rights led marchers from Tiquipaya to converge with another column from Vinto and Quillacollo.

Protestors used hot teargas canisters, debris into makeshift barricades, used cloths and such. The determined crowd overwhelmed the police. Bolivian security forces gave up their defence and launched over seven thousand canisters of tear gas and rubber bullets. Protestors were chanting demands and that 'we have won' and the government acquiesced. In April, the government revoked the contract.

This article is a combination of peaceful expressive activity and confrontation with security forces - unarmed militancy, using forceful, combative tactics such as property destruction, thrown projectiles, barricades to serve symbolic goals.

This in total creates tactical encounters that are numerically greater but qualitatively lesser, enabling crowds to hold significant urban spaces.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### UNARMED MILITANCY: BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND NONVIOLENCE

A tactical stance, denoting attitudes and practices (how people exercise physical action in protest, perceive their role in politics, interpret state repression and judge appropriate responses to it, combining tactics, ethics and a theory of change).

Armed struggle - overarching organization challenges the state with lethal violence, refusing to accept the one-sided physical vulnerability of the oppressed.

Nonviolence - disruptive actions but refuse to put pressure on the state, enduring rather than responding. The suffering makes the cost of confronting them unbearable, integrating vulnerability and suffering into political conversation.

Civil-resistance scholars dismiss unarmed militancy, Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan applied the same criteria to find that armed insurgents discourage participation (criteria only applied to movements overthrowing governments and ending colonial oppression)

In Bolivia, activist and public discussion rarely centers on the violence/nonviolence dichotomy. Indeed, several of my interviewees did not recognize protester “resistance” and “violence” as the same thing. Among the movement activists I met with and studied in Bolivia, combative and pacific means stand alongside one another as interchangeable alternative elements in a common narrative structure.[8](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-note-0008_65 "Link to note") In their pocket-sized handbook _Métodos de Lucha_ (Methods of Struggle), the Cochabamba Factory Workers’ Federation labor education school draws no boundaries between self-sacrifice and force, so long as the means “achieves positive responses to its demands” and “calls out the attention of the rest of the people.” Evenhandedly, it notes, “some marches or mobilizations are no longer realized just carrying placards but rather by also carrying stones, sticks, or dynamite; while others are done with water balloons in hand.” Bolivian teachers’ unions, who have earned a reputation for labor militancy, have engaged simultaneously in both forceful street confrontations and hunger strikes, notably in a massive strike wave that provoked a state of emergency in 1989. This integrated view of protesters’ tactical choices allows for the strategic inclusion of confrontational tactics within larger frameworks of protest.

### MATERIAL ACTS AND STRATEGY IN CONTEMPORARY UNARMED MILITANCY IN BOLIVIA

Contrary, unarmed militants often maintained cooperative, even immersive, relationships with larger mass movements.

The civic strike (_paro cívico_) combines road blockades, marches, open confrontation with security forces, organizational endorsements of demands, hunger strikes, grassroots-organized referenda, open public meetings, and numerous symbolic actions carried out upon property, persons, and space. Like conventional union organizers, participants stage these events in a regular sequence of collective organization, striking, escalation, negotiation, and concessions. But unlike in the Bolivian general strikes of the 1930s to 1980s, trade unions are not the protagonists of these economic shutdowns. “Rather than the traditional labor movement,” Coordinadora spokesman Oscar Olivera ([2004](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0040), 47) wrote, “it was the new world of work that came out into the streets: the unemployed, the self-employed, the young, and the women.” As Sian Lazar ([2006](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0031), 186ff) describes for El Alto, the labor union, neighborhood, and rural community of origin each provide “organisational bases for revolt” in contemporary uprisings. Multiple movements collaborate in a series of space-claiming actions, sometimes escalating into a total shutdown of commercial and civic life through coordinated marches, road blockades, enforced closures of businesses, and a general strike. In these forms of mass protest, tactical outcomes—control over space, access to symbolically important places, and impacts on commerce—matter. They provide economic leverage over the state and/or claim spaces that symbolize governance and popular democracy.

By taking over these spaces, protesters attract state intervention. Police and other security forces arrive in attempts to open roadways or keep demonstrators out of politically significant spaces, provoking confrontation. But the government's choice to repress protest generates a new vulnerability: if controlling protest is an expression of its rule, then failure to control it is a symbol of its powerlessness. The tactics chosen by unarmed militants deploy a numerical advantage to offset the state's capacity for violence. Stones laid on a highway or slingshots challenging riot police are useless unless the police are outnumbered but highly effective when the protesters have the advantage of numbers. Protesters’ weapons are harmful but very rarely lethal. Hence, they suffer the vast majority of injuries and fatalities. Unarmed militants refuse to yield in confrontations with state forces; they fight back in uneven contests in order to hold physical space, obstruct the flows of daily life, and impose social costs.

### SUBJECTIVITY AND FELT SOLIDARITY, NARRATIVE: THE "BATTLE" AS A NOD TO THE PAST AND AN ORIENTING MYTH

"At the subjective level, mass public participation in large-scale protests generates a profoundly felt but also empirically grounded sense of unity. As Jeffrey Juris ([2008b](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0026)) argues, collective action in the streets produces “affective solidarity,” as shared emotional experiences drive mutual identification among allies who experience danger, uncertainty, relief, play, and joy in tandem.[11]( https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-note-0011_74 "Link to note") Unarmed militant practice amplifies these emotions: Through the experience of holding space against determined adversaries, participants illustrate to one another (and to themselves) popular unity, collective power, and capacity for sacrifice."

Moments of unity: tear gas, shared risk, acts of material aid

At one level, these narrative frames are a form of intergenerational citation (or intertextuality; see Lazar [2015](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0032)) between present protests and events of the past. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui ([2010](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0043), 211–18) has long described the consciousness of Indigenous Bolivians as grounded in a memory of decades and centuries. From the 1920s to the 1960s, workers’ movements consistently organized strikes and intermittently armed militias to back their active unionism, while violent rural uprisings culminated in the agrarian reform of 1953. Across Bolivia, certain sectoral organizations—El Alto's Neighborhood Councils, the Aymara Indigenous community of Achacachi, the Cooperative Miners’ Federation in Potosí—cultivate a particularly militant profile and claim traditions of armed revolt as their political inheritance.

At a second level, martial language is purely descriptive. On February 5, 2000, local newspaper _Los Tiempos_ described the city as “an immense battlefield in which police repression had no limits…. The troops did not limit their force and repressed pitilessly.” These words of war are neither casual nor literal. Rather, martial language recognizes the presence of open, physical confrontation, the extended nature of the conflict, and the danger of participation.

At a third level, the language of war and battles is an interpretive frame. Between a resonant event and a larger revolution is a process of symbolic action and interpretation that draws in—and rewrites—notions of political participation, coercion, and legitimacy (Sewell [2005](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0048), 244–62). When French syndicalist Georges Sorel ([1915](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0052), 22) wrote about the proletarian general strike, he focused on the way workers “picture their coming action as a battle in which their cause is certain to triumph,” a viewpoint he called a social myth. When the strike begins, the theoretical division of society into antagonistic classes suddenly becomes real: “the interests and the different ways of thinking of … the foremen clerks, engineers, etc.,” are set in sharp relief from “the workmen who alone go on strike” (144). The general strike as myth, wrote Sorel, serves as a sort of orientation kit, comprising map, compass, weaponry, and overall strategy. In “every circle which has been touched by the idea of the general strike … the slightest incidents of daily life become symptoms of the state of war between the classes … every conflict is an incident in the social war” (145). “The Water War was like a political school for many young people of my time,” recalled Cochabamban activist María Eugenia Flores Castro, “It opened my eyes to see another reality that was all around me” (interview, April 14, 2011).

Protestors narrative echo but do not replicate the narrative structure of military confrontation - there is an asymmetry at the heart of the story and in purposes. This distinction is maintained as protesters' force is described as the embodiment of the people. Tactical means escalate in ways that keep them a notch below the state security forces they confront.

"Sometimes, as in this case, “speaking” through militant action allows unarmed militant tactics to be integrated into the conventional cycle of labor conflict: collective organization, striking, escalation, negotiation, and concessions. At others (as in the Gas War), combative tactics are the expression of an emerging, unconventional political force that questions the right of the current government to rule, proposing that it has lost the mandate of the people."

This examination of practice, narrative, subjectivity, and self-definition illustrates the strategic and often critical role unarmed militants can play in effective mass mobilization. Unarmed militants adopt the strategic imperatives of self-defense and control over space from armed struggle and of mass participation and moral distinction from nonviolence. When protesters leverage numbers and commitment to enable themselves to survive and resist police tactics, they are demonstrating a kind of power that combines physical efficacy and political legitimacy. Their encounter with state violence is marked by both heroism and suffering, and their practical and ethical choices must necessarily serve to distinguish their own acts from that of their adversaries. Confrontational militancy is not separate from the central work of mobilizing in large numbers and demonstrating broad popular support. The bodies of unarmed militants, whether defiant, wounded, or memorialized after their death, are potent political symbols of larger collectives. The practical acts and images created by confrontation contribute to the alchemy by which one set of state actions (or occasionally state actors) is repudiated and a new path is elevated as the natural expression of the will of the people.

Unarmed militancy is globally significant; forceful, resistant crowds play important roles in creating political openings. By disrupting the economic life of apartheid South Africa in the 1980s, seizing Argentina's streets in the December 2001 political crisis, and securing and defending access to Egypt's Tahrir Square in January 2011, unarmed militants played pivotal roles in major political transitions. Across the world, unarmed militants embrace a wide range of ideologies and strategies. Many of the tactics celebrated in the antiglobalization compendium _We Are Everywhere_ (Notes from Nowhere [2003](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0039)), for example, were echoed on the Maidan in Kyiv as part of the campaign for Ukraine to join (rather than protest) the European Union (Channell-Justice [2016](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0010)). In Thailand, political factions have deployed unarmed militant tactics and road blockades to opposing ends over the past decade (Sopranzetti [2014](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-bib-0051)). The terrain on which these actions are practiced, in terms of obstacles, traditions, legality, legitimacy, and collective memory, is also highly variable and situated in each context.

Nonetheless, there are imaginative, political, and emotional resonances between the many scenarios where unarmed militancy arises.[17](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1111/aman.13382#aman13382-note-0017_94 "Link to note") The circulation of images and narratives of collective action is intrinsic to each unarmed militant protest, part of the process of mobilizing, justifying, and contesting the armed forces they face down. Yet these images and narratives always circulate more broadly, drawing in a broader circle of interest. There are also signs of growing cross-movement attention and interchange linking unarmed militant activists across their sites of activity. The Water War inspired solidarity protests in San Francisco, New Yorkers traveled to Oaxaca and organized solidarity protests at the local Mexican consulate, and public missives were addressed from Tahrir Square veterans to the Occupy movement and from West Bank Palestinians to protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. These steps indicate that a vital global conversation among participants in unarmed militancy and theorists of their tactics and strategies is emerging. The accompanying process of scholarly theorization and comparative analysis—long-standing for armed struggles and increasingly solidified for the practice of nonviolence—is just coming into focus for unarmed militancy.
