## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Street demonstrations are a common form of political action across Latin America and globally. In this article, I explore some aspects of their symbolic and experiential power, with a focus on ideas of physical and visual intertextuality and their importance in the construction of political agency. I do so through an examination of the symbolic and aesthetic experiential politics of dances, parades, and demonstrations in Bolivia, suggesting that similarities between these practices constitute a kind of citation, which enables each to partake of the symbolic power and resonance of the others. I then investigate the similar political and symbolic work done in Argentine demonstrations by visual (and auditory) intertextuality—but in this case across practices separated by time. I argue that the concept of intertextuality enables an understanding of agency that is not confined to conscious human intentionality and that acknowledges readers as much as actors.

The Torchlight Parade.

A discussion of three Bolivian practices of festival, parade and demonstration that share similarities in look, feel and experience. These practices mimic or reference the other, engaging in the symbolic politics of others.

Referencing is a kind of visual intertextuality that shapes political actions. It is not citation - people can read the citation differently.

### INTERTEXTUALITY, POLITICAL RITUAL, AND POLITICAL ACTION

Richard Bauman - the 'relational orientation of a text to other text'.
Geertz - human behaviour as symbolic action.
Movement towards interpretation? Ethnographies of protest requires symbolic analysis with other analysis that focus on political economy or relationship between protestors and the city.

Visual intertextuality: "... Intertextuality is a process of interaction between conscious or almost conscious re-enactment of key historical moments and the hailing of such by one or several audiences, including the media." (244)

Intertextuality should also encompass physical or sensual experiences - bodies and senses in space. For example, the ritual nature, communicative - "as public event" aspects and more.

To see:
1. The Bolivian case as how citation can work across space and practices, physically and visually
2. Argentine case to illustrate citation across time
3. Contrasted in terms of intentionality and explicitness of interpretations

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### POLITICAL AGENCY EXPRESSED IN PHYSICAL FORM

**Context**: September 14th, neighbourhood of Rosas Pampa, El Alto, Bolivia. The zone holds a civic parade and then in the afternoon, dance groups through the Entrada. Then the following morning, early mass at church, then "Diana" when the dancers danced the same route without the costume. On Sunday, a bullfight in the nearby football field.

Festivals on occasion of the anniversary of the neighbourhood or village. Civic parades on important events.

```ad-quote
title: power (245)
"Festivals and parades are organized in similar fashion, through the convocatoria described in the opening paragraph of this article. The convocatoria is not merely the name for the piece of paper that invites participation; it also names one of the most important powers held by organized social forces such as trade unions or neighbor associations in El Alto and refers to the power to convene large numbers of people. The civic parade is an important way to show to state authorities the “power of convocatoria” wielded by specific organizations or individual leaders, but another means of demonstrating this power is street demonstrations, also organized by paper convocatoria. Often (particularly on the first of May), civic parades shade into or become protest marches, sharing physical form and—very occasionally—recognizing explicitly the overlap, as in the chant, “this is not a parade, it is a protest march.”

```

In all three practices, corporate groupings move through space in a unified way. Dance groups are organized on the basis of kin or occupational group. In parades, schoolchildren march as their schools, gender segregated, adults march in blocks of union affiliation, council, et cetera.

These protests emerged out of concerns over gas extraction, the nature of democracy in the country, the nature of the state itself, murderous, inclusionary...

Parades and festivals celebrate belonging to neighborhood, city, or nation, and demonstrations usually address their demands to the national or city government. They are therefore all practices of citizenship—ways that individuals relate to the state (Lazar [2008](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0032)). The physical organization into small corporate groupings underlines the fact that, for all three, citizenship of the “imagined community” of the neighborhood or city is dependent upon insertion into smaller “face-to-face” communities (Anderson [1991](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0005)), organized on the basis of residence, kinship, or occupation. Those smaller communities are marked out in the festival by sound, movement, and costume; for the parade by the sign at the front of the group and schoolchildren's uniforms; and for the demonstration by the banner or sign at the front of the collectivity.

Festivals, parades, and demonstrations are a means for individuals to define and physically experience the collectivity, creating a shared sense of identity through movement. The movement is strictly choreographed and acted out for the benefit of an audience lining the streets in the case of festivals and parades. Both culminate in a show for distinguished guests at a stage at the end of the route. In festivals, dancers dance in lines, either in single-sex groups or in couples. At the head of the lines are the “guides” who keep everyone disciplined. They dictate which steps those behind them will dance and when they will change from the basic forward motion step to one of four to six well-rehearsed movements. The dancers dance the basic step until the guides make a sign to indicate which special step they want next and whistle to prompt the group to move into that step. The end result is usually extremely impressive. Much effort goes into creating the costumes and into rehearsing so that everybody in the group does the correct movement at the correct times (see Figures [1](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-fig-0001)a and [1](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-fig-0001)b).

```

Then: focus on discipline, organization into corporate blocs, call and response - explicitly enforced by those in charge.

"The aesthetics and physical experience of uniformity within the group promote a collective vision of political agency. The uniformity requires considerable discipline to achieve, as evidenced in the dance rehearsals and actions of the guide at the front of the dance group or the shouts of the sociology director for us to keep in line." (246)

Can also see political belonging in how it is created in shared language of nationalism, parades and festivals held on important national and local civic dates. Continuum: highly stylized to the less.

The combination enables a dialectic whereby through citation each practice can perform features that are more prominent in the others. So, for example, the protest march can, through citation, make a claim to the civic parade's celebration of mainstream national belonging, as well as to the nested belonging that is part of both the parade and the festival. Thus, protesters can assert that they are not protesting against the Bolivian nation itself—even when they demand the resignation of the country's president, as they did in October 2003. By stressing national belonging, they claimed legitimacy for their protests and consequently delegitimized the (corrupt) guardians of the nation at the time, whom they accused of “selling off” the country. Also, with the use of both the national flag and the wiphala in demonstrations, marchers stress both their indigeneity and their belonging to the Bolivian nation; through the presence of such symbolic markers, they demand the recognition of that dual identity. Daniel Goldstein ([2004](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0021):4) has pointed out how festivals are spectacular presentations of the community to the national state, a “demand for inclusion in the national bodies politic and social.” Nicole Fabricant and Nancy Postero ([2013](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0019)) show how mestizo groups from the eastern regions of Bolivia used spectacular ritual performances to protest what they saw as their exclusion from the post-2006 national state, newly associated with highland indigeneity.[5](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-note-0005_60 "Link to note") The demand for recognition is made not only through the mobilization of symbolic language of nationalism but also through the physical citation of parades and festivals. The citation works the other way, too, meaning that parades and festivals can participate in the subversive potential of political demonstrations, as is recognized explicitly by the phrase in my title; hence, the use of the word _convocatoria_ both for the process of getting people to participate and to index a political grouping's ability to gain (and keep and demonstrate) large numbers of people.

The interplay of citation across practices and the consequent deepening of symbolic power was only very rarely explicitly articulated by residents of El Alto as intentional strategy—the “authorial borrowing” type of intertextuality identified earlier. It may better be understood as the other type of intertextuality that so appealed to poststructuralists: the constitution of symbolic practices through the assimilation of readily available cultural texts or symbolic productions. This is a process familiar to anthropologists, but attributing it merely to my own reading of these texts or conversely to some naturalized—or even historically produced—common way of doing things in El Alto would be a thin reading of the political agency and symbolic politics at play. Instead, I would suggest that citation is a significant symbolic technology that is deployed by participants in political rituals (including protests) within the circulation of symbols that are so central to political action. We could imagine this circulation as a symbolic economy of political action. As practices cite each other, they become more than the sum of their parts, in this case injecting subversive potential into mainstream modes of action and conversely claiming that more subversive modes of action are, in fact, part of mainstream performances of national belonging. Thus, intertextuality becomes a form of political construction, and festivals, parades, and protests not only are performative practices in their own right but also come to have a different sense and effect as a result of their intertextual relation to each other.

### (SENSORIAL) INTERTEXTUALITY AND THE PROTEST REPERTOIRE

2012 - Argentine economy slowed down - high inflation - controls on purchase of dollars - opponents not being able to address these problems because of a government that brooks no opposition - Protest occurred November 8 2012.

title: Interplay (250)
As with the Bolivian case, processes of citation deepened and complicated the power of symbolic political agency as enacted in this embodied and sensual event, but in the #8N cacerolazos, citation mostly worked across time rather than across space or practices. It drew out multiple and contradictory interpretations of the nature of the government and of popular discontent with its actions among both ordinary people and media commentators. This brought the interplay between demonstrator–performer and audience–interpreter into question and introduced tension between alternative local interpreters, whose readings depended to a great extent on their political positioning with respect to Cristina.

The #8N cacerolazos were a conscious re-enactment of the demonstrations held two months previously, and a subsequent cacerolazo held in April of 2013 was part of the same thread. Although the gatherings were particularly large, the fact of holding a mass demonstration was not in itself unusual. It brought in a number of intertextual citations in complex and contested ways. The most prominent in the conversations of the unionists I knew was the citation of the events of December 2001, when people took to the streets in opposition to controls placed on withdrawals from bank accounts. This culminated on December 19–20, when widespread protests including cacerolazos, food riots, and street marches led to President De la Rua's resignation and that of his four successors in the space of ten days. Those protests famously demanded “Que se vayan todos!” [They all must go]—referring to the whole political class (Auyero [2007](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0006); Robben [2007](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0037)). The connection with 2001 was very much in the minds of my interlocutors when they spoke about the #8N cacerolazo in its immediate aftermath. During a later discussion during a workshop on leadership run by the union, one union delegate said that the difference between the two was that in 2001 “the people” had been on the streets, whereas in 2012 it was only “people” on the streets.[11](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-note-0011_71 "Link to note") In Spanish, the distinction is not merely one of the definite article as in my translation because the speaker had used two different words: _el pueblo_ (the people) and _la gente_ (people). He was making the distinction between a mere crowd and a mass that constituted the Argentine people as a united national entity, a point I return to below. He was also contesting one of the organizers’ hoped-for interpretations of the cacerolazo's intertextuality, because for #8N to be fully successful as opposition to the government it needed to evoke through citation the chain of associations that linked it to 2001 and thereby to “que se vayan todos” and that sense of a definitive political crisis.

Produced debate around the nature of democratic government, credible opposition, representation, **spontaneity and class composition.**

The cacerola (pots and pans) technique was associated with the middle and wealthy classes.

```ad-quote
title: 251
Indeed, it is thought to have started in Chile in the early 1970s, when middle-class women banged pots and pans in their houses in protest at food shortages during Salvador Allende's government. It is therefore also closely associated with the right-wing Pinochet coup, and so this citation by means of the repetition of the pots and pans protest technique potentially undermines the claims of some of the #8N demonstrators that Cristina's government was dictatorial; indeed, this was the criticism of Cristina's regime that was most keenly felt by many of her supporters that I knew. In Argentina, the most famous cacerolazos of 2001 also provoked regime change and appeared to have occurred to a similar pattern to the Chilean ones (Sitrin [2006](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0039):22). The citation of previous cacerolazos in Argentina and the present ghost or subtext of the Chilean ones contributed to contradictory readings about class and democracy after the event. In combination with the reading of visual clues, such as the clothing, color of skin, and hairstyles of the protesters, these presences through citation meant that many pro-government interpreters saw the #8N cacerolazos as “middle class.” This undoubtedly enabled the government to feel confident about not changing its policies significantly because, they argued, their “national popular” project is supported by the popular classes, who had not taken to the streets.

If we grant that the protesters were on the whole “middle class,” as they were understood to be by the unionists with whom I worked (and this is actually contested), another layer of interpretation comes into play. The gatherings at the obelisk and the progression to the Plaza de Mayo also visually and physically cite previous mass protests of working-class people, the most celebrated of which is the demonstration of October 17, 1945, led by Eva Perón in protest at the imprisonment of Juan Domingo Perón. Antonius Robben ([2007](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-bib-0037)) has argued that mass, often violent, street demonstrations have punctuated Argentine political history and changed its course at several significant moments. The archetypal example of this is October 17 but also crucial were the following: the Cordobazo of May 17, 1969; the demonstrations greeting Perón's return from exile at Ezeiza airport in June 20, 1973 (which became a massacre); the protests against the Falklands war in 1983, which toppled the military dictatorship of the time; and the riots of December 2001.[12](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-note-0012_75 "Link to note") I would argue that the protagonists of the #8N demonstration and the other related cacerolazos were attempting to recreate the sense of regime crisis that is symbolized so powerfully by these previous mass demonstrations.

Why is this important?

Without the ability to read these cues, one might imagine that the president was very simply on the verge of being toppled by a mass uprising, as had happened in 2001. It would be difficult to imagine that she enjoyed any support at all, and her subsequent survival in office would be inexplicable. Yet it was important for government supporters at least to figure out exactly who was opposing her, how they were represented in institutional politics, and what was in fact the role of the media beyond reportage, especially given the particular politics of the opposition between the president and the Grupo Clarín media conglomerate.[]( https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aman.12227?saml_referrer#aman12227-note-0013_79 "Link to note")

The media is a crucial actor - questions of agency - how do people read this? - dual play - death of the author - shift in focus from actor-author to reader-interpreter - readings should be contested - understandings should not be not be reduced to instances of conscious intentionality - expansive notion of cultural textrs
