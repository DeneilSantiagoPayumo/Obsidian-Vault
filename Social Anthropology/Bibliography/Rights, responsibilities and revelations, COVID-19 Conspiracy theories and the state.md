An incorporation of COVID-19 into conspirational schemes worldwide provides us with a useful set of cross-culturally comparable conspiracy theories involving the state and thus a useful lens through which to enhance our thinking about how conspiracy theories work as sociocultural critiques.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Pandemic sense-making and dissent

Knowledge is instrumental - it is not distinguishable from culture. Pandemic conspiracy theories are less contests regarding specific detailed facts than contests regarding values.

#### Medical conspiracies and the state

Such conspiracy programs provoke concerns related to sovereignty, exploitation and social coherence.

Call and response:
- Many cultures use blood-stealing and organ-thieving stories to index how they physically fuel the global economy ... They express colonial trauma and critique both the non-democratic distribution of science's benefits, and the state's role in supporting this. (70)
- When the government insisted that individual behaviour change ... Would stem transmission, residents pushed back ... In challenging official discourses, they expressed 'an aspirational vision of citizenship based on political rights, social recognition, and access to high-quality public services delivered by a robust, responsible state.' (71)
- In Venezuela, cholera conspiracy theories directly addressed an 'economy of erasure' in which marginalised populations remained unheard ... The theories embodied a bid to be seen ... Articulated local-global links in ways that questioned the discursive production and segregation of these domains in addition to highlighting their state's failures. (71)
- In Eastern Indonesia, HIV/AIDS-related conspiracy theories reflected everyday experiences of 'inconsistent applications of policies, missing information, and omissions in formal practice', militarisation and racialisation in the study of setting (Butt 2005, 432)'

#### A waiting matrix / Contested expertise

COVID-19 emerged in this context - "themselves rooted in much older worries about the profit-minded capitalist promotion of purportedly unsafe electromagnetic technologies, and worries about modernity itself." (72). 

In England, anti-Semitic prejudice "drew upon already well-established jingoist and racist tropes ... expressed pre-existing geopolitical tensions" (72)

A dominant way for experts to deal with conspiracy theories is to try and 'debunk them'. This debunking disregards people's extant knowledges, technology supports a grand narrative towards metanarratives ([[Lyotard]])

"The uncertainty regarding specific origins, successful cures, prevention measures and risk for transmission expressed within the scientific community is exacerbated in the public mind by conflicting messages from different health authorities..." (73)

### New viral loadings: leveraging pandemic conspiracy theories

#### Ireland: rejecting foreign rule and state corruption.

"While almost every conspiracy theory propagated during the pandemic expresses concern over a loss of freedom, in Ireland this view resonates particularly strongly with the colonial legacy of, and national sentiments rooted in, the conflict with Britain ... The painful memory of brutal foreign rule was particularly visible in the arguments made by O'Doherty and John Waters when they legally challenged Ireland's lockdown restriction in the High Court, in April and May 2020." (75) - "Seemingly universal conspiracy theories gain traction when they amplify or provide a fitting explanation for a story already being told locally."

#### Poland: retaining democratic desires

Members believed that during COVID-19, the Polish nation would become a battlefield for the more powerful, for forced vaccination.

"The views expressed by this group’s members (mostly followers of alt-right presidential candidate Krzysztof Bosak, who was running against Duda) resemble the superconspiracies discussed above, their threads weaving pandemic worries into well-rehearsed anti-Semitic and Big Pharma tropes. However, as in the Irish case, here, too, ‘universal’ ideas need, for traction, to resonate with locally rooted sentiments and already-internalised culturally specific tropes. The Polish people endured struggles for independence from Russia, Prussia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the nineteenth century, from Fascist Germany and The Soviet Union during World War II, and from Communism in the 1940s–80 s. These tropes are highly relevant to Bosak’s followers." (78).

Conspiracy theories thus allow people to simplify complex histories and make sense of constant political changes - the processes can be visible in which Poland's private media expressed concerns over governmental mismanagement of the pandemic. The idea that the government was hiding the truth behind a façade caught on strongly.

#### US: shoring up a dream

"In the US, well-known tropes are also in play, but here they are linked to the crumbling American Dream of self-built prosperity, and to concerns regarding the freedoms meant to support it. Well before COVID-19, employment and wages for the US masses were declining ... the nation's failure to protect citizens from predatory lenders ... coupled with 'governmental bailouts' meant to shore up corporate wealth catalysed increasing cynicism regarding once-trusted institutions. The internet enabled disheartened citizens to engage with each other in ways hitherto impossible ..." (79)

"... So, rather than questioning the America Dream as a myth, which would mean giving up on the prospect, many citizens found it more satisfying to blame their downward mobility on 'bad apples', favouring the proposition that a few (very powerful) bad actors in positions of power barred them from 'success'. This perspective fuelled populist desire for leadership from beyond 'the establishment.'" (79)

Then - Donald Trump. After that, Q.

```ad-quote
title: 80-81
And here is a thread we wish to pull vigorously: a concern with corporate nefariousness, giving expression to a US-specific need for sustaining faith in one’s chances to attain the American Dream despite increasing wealth inequity. Trump’s base, cultivated from among the disaffected, preserves an imagined ladder to self-made success through faith in his leadership (not coincidentally, at his election convention Trump promised to ‘save the American Dream’). In part from this loyalty, simultaneous to anti-lockdown protests, rumours linking Fauci to Big Pharma bourgeoned. But there was more to it than that. Fauci sees COVID-19 squarely through the lens of authorised science – a lens discounted by Trump’s base and consistently pelleted with ‘alternative facts’ by others drawn to conspiracy theories. Moreover, Fauci argues, again pointing to science, that COVID-19 will be vaccine preventable. This simple contention expanded the anti-Fauci, anti-lockdown faction, providing a dog whistle for so-called anti-vaxxers.

### Undesired Governance

Four expressions of state power served as focal points for dissent:

1. Nanny State - over-interferes with citizens through regulation
2. Cardboard state - a functioning democracy at constant risk of collapse, pretend away COVID-19 because it does not have the resources.
3. Shadow state - made of 'flexians', made of members of corporate boards and thinktanks.
4. Deep state - highly, sinister plants with occult origins, deflect attentions from one's states and its shortcomings.

Knowledge is always political - conspiracy theories are designations that are also political and more. The label is a lumping device for dissenting narratives and a reciprocating technology for the production of doubt.
