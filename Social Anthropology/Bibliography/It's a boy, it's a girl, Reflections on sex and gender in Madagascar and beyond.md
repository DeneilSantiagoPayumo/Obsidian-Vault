**This concerns the [[Vezo]] people.**

## Article Introduction

>[!summary]
>This article will discus the question: why do the Vezo make a point about the sex of their new-born babies?
>
>This argument is organised as follows. The author, within the first three sections of the chapter, discusses why the Vezo might wish to ignore the sex of their new-born babies. Then, to understand why the Vezo announce: "it's a boy" or "it's a girl", we will understand the distinction between sex and gender. The author will discuss the category of people, the alter-egos of the new born babies. Then she will discuss the two contrasting forms of identities: activities done in the past and the essence inherited from the past, and how the Vezo use rituals to separate these kinds of existence.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Why might the Vezo wish to ignore the sex of their new-born babies?

title: Nobody is born human or Vezo
A key facet of Vezo learning: Vezo identity is not a fixed state of being which people are born into, but is a way of doing which people perform in the present and which makes them Vezo contextually and contingently. The difference between Vezo and Masikoro lies in the different things they do - identity is thus performative.

This applies to the Vezo body - it is made through practice. There are traces that their activities leave on their bodies, whitish scars of the fishing line on fingers, the build of men's bodies and eating a lot of fish.

People not only are not born Vezo, but they are also not born human. For example, the boundaries between mother and baby is fuzzy and ill-defined: it is not clear where one begins and another ends. The baby will make the mother crave food or make trouble when unhappy.

The mother is a vehicle for the baby's interest. If the father has done 'dirty things', the baby may refuse to emerge. The wounds left on the mother is likened to the wounds left on the baby's body: they are in danger of being penetrated by air, and must be kept hot and wrapped up in several layers of clothes and blankets. "In a sense the separation which has occurred at the moment of birth of this prolonged symbiosis, for it is the lack of strong and clearly defined bodily boundaries ... that require mother and baby to remain fused with each other." (35) Additionally, if the mother and baby aren't close to one another, there is a risk of a passing *angatse* (a spirit) that may shape the face of an unprotected baby because babies are malleable.

It is because babies are vulnerable that makes them less than human - they are laid without funeral, excluded from ancestral tombs and more.

The Vezo person is not gendered. The Vezo do not draw the radical distinction between male and female substance. They distinguish relationships on the basis of how each parent of each sex transmit their substance to their children - daughters receive milk and sons receive semen. The relationships they are in are marked categorically by gender. The emphasis here is on the sameness of the relationship.

The most significant part of the story will unfold as these babies grow up and gradually acquire what, at birth, they still lack: a "gender", as they act as a boy or a girl and gain the Vezo identity. Boys and girls are said to be just the same in their character and disposition - the only difference occurring at the moment of birth, as boys appear facing downwards so they don't look at their mother's vagina. These children will grow up and become socialised into different gender roles so why do they use sex as a fixed trait of a person?

We must turn towards the *sarin'ampela*, people who acquire a gender which contradicts their sex - this illustrates two opposite extremes in the dialectical interplay between sex and gender.

A *sarin'ampela* are 'men' who 'like women' (in the sense that they prefer to be women). They create an image of the woman they want to be.

One starts becoming a *sarin'ampela* from a young age - preferring to spend time with girls, braid their hair and their identity is defined by performing women's jobs and women's ways of doing things. In all cases though, sexual preference is secondary to the experience of being a *sarin'ampela*.

It is difficult to define exactly what they do as the definition of men's as opposed to women's job is rather fluid: people's livelihoods vary greatly, and gender roles change depending on the location. The distinction however still matter: men are to fish, women are to dry and salt the catch. Women carry loads on their heads, men do it with their shoulders. Women let their hair grow whereas men have theirs cut short. Women make a distinctive kind of laugh that men don't.

*Doing* is essential to how *sarin'ampela* identity is defined - making an important point about the processual nature of gender identity. The *sarin'ampela* become gendered through their way of acting and doing. For the Vezo, "gender is no more and no less an image - something that is created through what one does and does not do; something that one becomes. (44)"

How far can this be disengaged however? Informants remarked that these *sarin'ampela* still have a penis between their legs. They will never be treated as women when they die - in funerary procedures, people of their biological sex will handle them, and they will placed in the same tomb as their sex. Their image is negated during death.

title: Sex and Gender
[[Judith Butler]] argued that the distinction doesn't matter: sex appears to be natural, given and intractable as a result of a specific discursive practice. This emans that sex is culturally constructed as gender.

[[Yanagisako and Collier]] advocated the analytical disengagement of gender from sex - gender, as we invented it is the cultural elaboration of sexx. Gender should now be defined as the "pure" difference, not connected to biological difference and completely disconnected from sex.

[[Henrietta Moore]] argues that we should free themselves of the sex/gender dichotomy as it is too easy to search for how sex is transformed into gender and prevents us from asking how different cultures construct the difference between men and women, and blinds us to the fact that categories of sexual difference are as culturally variable as gender constructs.

Why has the author chosen to rescue this dichotomy? Rather, it captures the cultural theme that engages the Vezo of Madagascar. Our sex and their genitals share a fundamental feature - they are categorically fixed and intractable.

The Vezo are deeply engaged by the tension between malleability and fixity, indeterminacy and determinacy. They resolve this tension by drawing a sharp distinction between the living - who create their identity through activities performed in the present - and the dead, whose only identity is given as an essence inherited from the past.

In rituals and interactions with the ancestors, "Vezo negotiate the boundary between life and death, between processuality and fixity, between what human beings create and make of and for themselves in the course of their lives, and what they are given as irreducibile features of their personhood."

Gender identity is created processually and acquired through practice - but people born, live and die with their intractable sex.

Butler is right that the pre-discursive nature of sex is the effect of a discursive practice, this si not peculiar to the West but grounded in the shared human experience of discovering hte limits to the transformation of one's sexed body, and of creating an image.
