## Article Introduction

```ad-important
title: Context
From 1978-1981 the Irish National Liberation Army male prisoners undertook a form of protest against prison authorities and British government, refusing to leave their cells either to wash or use the toilet. In 1980, they were joined by female comrades. There was fecal and excretal imagery everywhere. This protest had no precedent - and was incomprehensible to the public.

Foucault analyzed punishment in the prison system - the subjective transformationh of individuals from dangerous criminals to dociel citizens. At what points, however, does technology of normalisation break down and rational disciplines fail to produce docile subjects?

Let's combine The Dirty Protest with the anthropological 'deep play' - how feces and menstrual bloods characterized the dirty protest as overdetermined primordial symbols. Primordil symbols that resort to great psychological significance.

There was a lot of physical abuse, gendered and sexual harassment. Physical punishment disciplined these prisoners and humiliated them through male dominance. Additionally women, sexually harassed and losing close relatives in shooting, invoked this protest. 

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### HUMILIATION AND VIOLENCE: THE DEEP PLAY OF SUBJECTIVITY

These physical punishments were aimed at socializing prisoners into the new social order: the random beatings, scarce diet, constant visibility, body searches defeated their will and transformed them into dependent infantilized subjects. Prisoners had nothing but their bodies to resist assault. (p, 129)

This dirty protest had a painful psychological and physical element.

title: the psychological pain (130) then a summary (131-132)
"Physical pain, insufficient diet, and constant humiliation evoked in the prisoners, in acute and extreme form, the vulnerability and powerlessness of childhood ... fantasies of dismemberment, dislocation and mutiliation accompanied any venture outside the cells and were particularly present during body searches, forced baths, and wing shifts."

"The Dirty Protest was simultaneously a sign of rejection and an instrument of power, but one that constituted also the symbolic articulation of dangerous feeligns that could not be expressed in other forms without risking madness or serious physical injury ... its significance was elaborated by them in the idiom of Republican resistance, which is part of Northern Ireland's nationalist culture. THe prisoners' political beleifs arise out of a shared social experience of the working-class ghettos and are essential to the protest in that they provide its rationale and moral legitimation."
```

The dirty protest must be understood as violent attempt to existential recognition (politically or otherwise) without succumbing to physical elimination.

### EXCREMENT AND THE FICTION OF CIVILIZATION

```ad-quote
title: Excrement, 136
"The images of the prisoners surrounded by excretas reinforce stereotypes of Irish barbarism, yet the inability ment and administrators to handle the situation reveals other effects. Thus, I would argue that the fantasies of savagery project onto Catholics were appropriated, literalized, and enacted by prisoners. This materialization inevitably confronted the officers in an inescapable physical form with their own aggressive fantasies which produced shock, horror, and the futile attempt to erase them by increasing violence, forced baths, and periodic steam cleaning of cells-acts of cleansing that, like the dirtying of the prisoners were both literal and symbolic (Feldman 1991:185). The "Dirty Irish" had became really shitty. In so doing they were transforming the closed universe of prison into an overflowing cloaca, exposing in the process a Boschian vision of the world, a scathing critique of Britain and, by association, of civilization.
```

It was a mirror of colonial barbarism that reflected onto the officers and challenged their identity of a civilized nation.

### DIRT AND BLOOD: THE MEANING OF SEXUAL DIFFERENCE

What can make thirty dirty women more revolting than 400 dirty men, if not the exposure of menstrual blood? In popular consciousnesses, women did not belong to prison. People assumed that women would abandon political activities that are too risky. 

Women had to reject gender as a differential factor in political militancy - they preferred to be part of the IRA than its feminine counterpart, Cumman na mBan.

However, the menstrual blood reintroduced this gender difference - objectified a difference that women had carefully obliterated in other dimensions of their life. "In so doing, the menstrual blood became a symbol through which gender identity was reflected upon, bringing to the surface what had been otherwise erased. (139)

The Nationalist community did not understand *women's* pain.

```ad-quote
title: 141
The young women in Armagh, like the men in Long-Kesh, conceptualized their physical and psychological pain within the parameters of a religious ethic of salvation acting in the political arena. At the level of conscious purpose it was for them a necessary requisite to save Ireland from colonization and reestablish a just and equal society in a reunited Irish land. This ethic of salvation acted as an interpretative language for pain that would otherwise be meaningless. Yet if a religious-political frame can provide meaning to the prisoners' pain, it cannot express it. Their suffering eludes language. Republican women could narrate the events of the Dirty Protest, but the emotional experience was encountered with painful silence and the explicit admission of lacking words to describe it.

```ad-quote
title: Demanding recognition, 144
When the Armagh women demanded to be part of the IRA, rejecting its feminine branch, they were criticizing a genderized system that set them in the position of political subsidiaries. This critique already modified the terms of the system. Simiilarly, by mimetically reappropriating the Dirty Protest, the Armagh women at first negated gender difference, stating that their struggle was the same as that of the men. Yet this attempt to transcend a genderized context by negating the feminine was negated in turn by the objectification of sexual difference that the menstrual blood represented. Thus, the mimetic appropriation of the Dirty Protest entailed a process of rewriting a (hi) story of resistance, a rewriting that specified the feminine in its most transgressive form. But it also entailed a refiguration of the feminine inasmuch as it was affirmed not as a shared essence but as existentially inseparable from class and ethnic posiitions.
```

In conclusion, these are primordial symbols - invested with political power, have a performative character, arising out of the social order.
