# Chapter X
## Article Introduction
[[Richard Borsay Lee]] spent over three years conducting fieldwork among the !Kung San, an isolated population of 1,000 people in northern Botswana.
This article is an extension of this study.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?
The necessity of work is a basic law of human existence - all human societies have had to work to survive: in state societies the nature of work has become incredibly complex. With the advent of capitalism, some owners of capital do not work at all. Everyone worked.

Underlying the network of social relations anthropologists are so fond of studying is a network of energy relations to which we pay little or no attention. Yet the basic units of social behaviour and interaction have never been satisfactorily defined and isolation.

The methods of energetics, nutrition, demography, and ecology seemed to offer a way out of this impasse. Armed with these tools of analysis, we could ask questions such as: how many days do people work per week, how many dependents does each active worker support, how adequate is the diet in terms of calories, proteins and nutrients?

### How is the article organised?
This chapter presents the results of a work diary collected at Dobe in July and August 1964 - data on work effort in relation to group size, sex and age, efficiency and male hunting success and more. Housework and tool making are estimated to arrive at a final estimate of overall work levels.
### ~~What are the key takeaways?~~

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Context
#### Operationalisation: (252-254)
The main kind of work the !Kung do is subsistence work: hunting and gathering. They also manufacture and maintain their tools, clothing and housing. Any activities carried out in a socially pleasurable context are not considered work. Household and domestic work here is considered as part of a separate activity to compare it to industrial and other societies.

"Work is defined as those activities that contribute to the direct appropriation of food, water, or materials from the environment. These include three main categories of activities:
1. Subsistence ...
2. Manufacture and maintenance of tools of subsistence...
3. Housework" (253)

Units of measurement include: counting the number of people who did work on any given day, and in some cases clocking them in and out of camp. This gives a good count of the number of workdays, and the length of a working day.

This does not interfere with the flow of activities and allows the observer to follow a number of people through the day.

#### Other interesting contextualise information revolving around working patterns

*On how much they work*
"The low input of work required to feed a camp of hunting and gathering people challenges the notion that the life of hunter-gatherers is a constant struggle for existence, with subsistence work dominating their lives. The !Kung San, at least during the month of this study, appear to spend less than half their days in subsistence and appeared to enjoy more leisure time than the members of many agricultural and industrial societies." (259)

*On gift-giving*
"When a person visits Dobe and is fed by the Dobe people, he or she incurs an implicit obligation to reciprocate hospitality at a later date." (259)

*On gender balances*
"The work effort for visiting men and women was similar, but resident men were observed to work an average of 12 out of 28 days, whereas resident women worked about 9 out of 28 days. This finding contradicts the view that women are the workhorses of a foraging society: Men appear to work a third harder than do women." (261)

*Work effort among the men and women*
"My overall sense, after viewing men and women at work in many !Kung camps, is that the Dobe data are on the high side for old men, too low for young men, and fairly representative for women. My impression is that the male-female differences in work effort observed here hold true at other camps." (265)

*Efficiency in hunting*
"Overall, the men's hunting made a positive contribution to the energy balance, but not a particularly efficient one. In each day of hunting the hunter consumed about 2800 calories and 90 g of protein; his work yielded 7900 calories (raw basis) and 343 g of protein, for a net contribution to the group of 5100 calories and 253 g of protein." (267)

*Allocation of calories, paraphrased (272)*
How is this modest surplus of calories given to the camp allocated?
1. Part of the surplus goes to maintain the camp's hunting dogs - the dogs eat what is left over, absorbing the marginal variations in abundance of foodstuffs
2. The surplus is also used to meet the caloric demands of the !Kung trance-healing dance. The dances involve the whole camp and go on from dusk till dawn. With the men dancing and going into trance and the women sitting up all night singing and clapping, a dance requires a substantial amount of energy; the participants in a single full-night trance dance may consume calories equivalent to those used in a full waking day
3. The rest may go to physiological accumulation of fat.

### Other forms of work: manufacture, maintenance, and repair (Start - 272)

Manufacture and maintenance of tools of subsistence and of other essentials such as clothing and housing must be considered in any comprehensive view of their work lives - tool making and tool fixing (also including karosses, dogs, sandals, storage structures, huts and more).

The summary of results offers surprising insights in tool making and fixing: (276-277)
1. First we see the interdependence of men and women. Many of the tools used by women are made for them by men. Housing used by both men and women is made by the latter. 
2. Second, we see that in both making and fixing subsistence tools men carry a heavier share of the work than women ...
3. Work on clothing is comparable for men and women ... But in the area of housing women do much more of the work.

"Overall the man's daily work load is estimated at 64 minutes compared with 45 for the woman..." (ibid))

*On Work Effort*
"Overall, women do more housework than men, although because of the men's predominance in butchery, meat cooking, and firewood collecting, the difference between the sexes is not as great as one might expect...." (278)"

*On the final tally*
"Men clearly have the heavier share of work in subsistence and tool making and repair. Women do more housework than men, but overall the men appear to have a longer work week. The shorter subsistence workday of the women does not result in a lower return in foodstuffs; we have already noted that women provide more food per day of gathering than men provide per day of hunting. Women return to the camp earlier in the day than men. They use the time to ensure that the ostrich eggshell canteens are filled and that some food is prepared to await their husbands' arrival later in the afternoon if both happen to be out that day." (278-280)

You can't therein say that men are the exploited members of the !Kung society. A major category of work still is child care, and a child's own mother falls 60 to 80 percent of the work with young children. This does not suggest the notion that women are the exploited members of the !Kung society.
