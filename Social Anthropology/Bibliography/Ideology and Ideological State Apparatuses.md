## A summary of the book:

Althusser's discussion on the state of ideology, or how the state reproduces false class consciousness.
## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Althusser's conception of ideology

Ideology has no history.
Marx envisioned ideology as a pure dream, empty and vain, constituted by the day's residues. Ideology thus is a pure dream, and has no history of its own **which does not mean that there is no history in it.**

A statement: ideology has no history and must be related to Freud's proposition that the unconscious is eternal, i.e. that it has no history. Thus, ideology is eternal and Althusser aims to propose a theory of ideology in general.

#### Thesis I: *Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence.*

Commonly associated with 'world outlooks' where we admit that the ideology we are discussing from a critical point of view, these world outlooks as imaginary and not corresponding to society. If we however admit that they do not correspond to reality, we admit that they allude to reality and thus must be *interpreted* to discover the hidden reality.

Why does ideology exist? "What is represented in ideology is therefore not the system of the real relations which govern the existence of individuals, but the imaginary relation of those individuals to the real relations in which they live." (111)

This provides an alternative question: why is representation given to individuals relation to the social relations which govern their conditions of existence and their collective and individual life necessarily an imaginary relation?

#### Thesis II: Ideology has a material existence

"An ideology always exists in an apparatus, and its practice, or practices. This existence is material." (112)

"The ideological representation of ideology is itself forced to recognise that every 'subject' endowed with a 'consciousness' and believing in the 'ideas' that his 'consciousness' inspires in him and freely accepts, must '*act* according to his ideas' must therefore inscribe his own ideas as a free subject in the actions of his material practice. If he does not do so, 'that is wicked.'" (113)

Thus, ideology of ideology recognises that the ideas of a human exist sin his actions, and lends him other ideas corresponding to the actions that he performs - practices.

Two central notions of subject, consciousness, belief and actions:
1. There is no practice except by and in an ideology
2. There is no ideology except by the subject and for subjects

(115)

### Ideology interpellates individuals as subjects

This thesis focuses on the latter proposition, that there is no ideology except for concrete subjects, and that this destination is only made possible by the category of the subject and its functioning.

Ideology imposes obviousness as obviousness which we cannot fail to recognise and recognise as obvious. At work in this reaction is the ideological *recognition* function which is the two functions of ideology, the inverse being misrecognition.

Althusser uses an example of meeting an acquaintance on the street, shaking their hand and saying 'hello, my friend!' He points out that we are subjects and function in rituals, and that this recognition only gives us the consciousness of our incessant practice of ideological recognition but it doesn't give sense of the knowledge of the mechanism of this recognition.

This category of subject is constitutive of ideology which only exists by constituting concrete subjects as subjects.

Several formulations:
1. All ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects, by the functioning of the category of the subject (distinguish between concrete individuals and concrete subjects).
2. Ideology acts and functions in that it recruits subjects among the individuals by that precise operation called interpellation ("Hey, you there!")

```ad-example
Take a police officer yelling, "Hey you there!"
The individual will turn around, becoming a subject as he recognises that the hail was addressed to him and that it was him who was hailed.
Thus, what seems to take place in ideology seems therefore to take place outside it and vice versa.
```

"Ideology has always-already interpellated individuals as subjects, which amounts to making it clear that individuals are always-already interpellated by ideology as subjects which necessarily leads us to one last proposition: *individuals are always-already subjects.*"

### The Christian Religious Ideology

We shall use a rhetorical figure.
It says, you are Peter - God exists and you are answerable to him, this is who you are and this is your place in the world.

This is a familiar discourse. If we consider that religious ideology is indeed addressed to individuals, in order to transform them into subjects, Peter is free to obey or disobey the appeal.

The interpellation of individuals as subjects presupposes the existence of a Unique and central Other Subject in whose Name the religious ideology interpellates all individuals as subjects. All this is clearly written in the scripture.

God identifies himself as the Subject and he who interpellates his subject, the indivudal subjected to him by his very interpellation.

God is thus the Subject, and Moses and the innumerable subjects of God's people, the Subject's interlocutors-interpellates. The structure of all ideology, interpellating individuals as subjects in the name of a Unique and Absolute Subject is speculary: this mirror duplication of ideology and ensures its functions. All ideology is centreed around the Absolute Subject and interpellates around it the infinity of individuals into subjects in a double mirror-connection such that it subjects the subject to the Subject...

Summary:
The duplicate mirror-structure of ideology ensures simultaneously:
1. The interpellation of individuals as subjects
2. Their subjection to the Subject
3. The mutual recognition of subject and Subject, the subjects' recognition of each other and finally the subject's recognition of himself
4. The absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition the subject recognise what they are and behave accordingly

(122-123)

Vast majority of subjects work all right by themselves, recognising the existing state of affairs. In the term subject, someone is interpellated as a free subject in order that he shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject.

In the end, ISAs contribute to this reproduction, it is only within the processes of production and circulation that this reproduction is realised through how the training of the workers is completed, their posts assigned and more. This is still abstract though

The ISAs are not the realisation of ideology in general. It is by the installation of ISAs in which the ideology is realised and becomes itself the ruling ideology, achieved on the stake in a very bitter class struggle.
