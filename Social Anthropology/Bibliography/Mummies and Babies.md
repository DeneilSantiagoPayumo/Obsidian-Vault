>This paper examines an institutionalized friendship among adolescent girls and young women in southern Africa. Lesotho's economy is based on migrant male labor, which leaves the women dependent on male earnings or subsistence from the land, and also creates unstable marital relations. Young girls in the modern schools develop close relationships, called “mummy-baby,” with slightly older girls. Sexual intimacy is an important aspect of these relationships. Mummy-baby relationships not only provide emotional support prior to marriage, but also a network of support for married and unmarried women in the new towns or schools, either replacing or accompanying heterosexual bonds.

## A summary of the book:

This paper examines an institutional friendship in Lesotho, an independent migrant labour exporting country in Southern Africa. These adolescent Basotho girls refer to each other through terms like "mummies" and "babies", akin to heterosexual courtship. As girls experience puberty, loss of virginity and childbirth, these mummy and baby relationships help the girls handle their physical maturation, emotional growth and broadening social relationships.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

```ad-seealso
title: Context
collapse: closed

Lesotho is a country surrounded by the Republic of South Africa. Dominant feature is male migrant labour, and men migrate to South Africa leaving women in Lesotho without fathers, brothers, husbands and sons.

Employment for women are few and poorly paid, forcing them to depend on male earnings and subsistence agriculture. It prevents adultery, non-support, desertion and more. Girls leave their natal kin and move to their husband's home, and spend their early years of marriage waiting for the migrant husband's occasional visits.

### Mummy-baby relations

Basotho girls engage in three activities where they act out different aspects of adult female roles - pretending to cook, performing mock-marriages without husbands and "in dyadic mummy-baby friendships they experience the nurturing aspects of mothering and being mothered, without the risks of childbirth or the responsibilities of child-care". (99)

Through these means, these girls are socialized into adult female roles. Lesotho custom, girls are usually forbidden from discussing sexual matters since they haven't borne children, so these mummy-baby relationships help fictive mothers provide what a biological mother cannot.

Three aspects of traditional female society helped provide these mummy-baby relationships: firstly, special gift-exchange partnerships, secondly an underlying influence of female initiation traditions and finally the practice of lengthening the labia minora to enhance sexual pleasure during intercourse.

These relationships are most common among pre-adolescent and adolescent school girls. Older unmarried girls who have dropped out and remain in the village or those who've gone into towns to seek employment often maintain old ties and form new ones in the urban environment.

```ad-quote
"Once two girls agree to be mummy and baby, the relationship develops through arranged encounters and by material, nurturant, and emotional exchanges which vary with relative age and marital status of the partners. (103)"
```

The dominant member of the dyad arranges the meetings and deferential behaviour towards the older women are expected.  Often, these schoolchildren will issue one another love letters to express their feelings.

Mummies have to partake in gift-giving: providing sweets, cosmetics, head-ties, clothing and more. For babies in boarding schools, material exchanges are more important. Babies sometimes give peaches and vegetables or small things, but typically they are in the receiving end of the transaction.

The older mummies helped provide advice and protection concerning love-relationships with men.  Since a girl's own mother can rarely give realistic advice or protection because of traditional prohibitions on sexual discourse, "adolescent mummy can provide advice on sex and protection from aggressively courting young men which a mother cannot give." (104).

Additionally, these mummy-baby relationships help exchange affection and sensual satisfaction - they hug, and kiss, provide romance and more.

There are three distinct levels of intimacy:
1. The common form of greeting when Basotho friends and relatives kiss each other on the lips
2. The way mummies and babies kiss and hug each other, resting on the bed or embracing
3. Genital sexuality - however, Christian views of homosexuality do exist and the author notes that "my limited faculty in the language ... prevented clarification" and that informants may have perceived their responses in two different ways.

"It is clear that these structured friendships provide opportunities for adolescent girls to discover and enjoy with other girls their own developing sexuality within a parentally tolerated relationships. They fill this need at an age when heterosexual relations are forbidden by adults." (106). It also allows these girls to experience both dominant and receptive sexual roles.

Features of initiative, secrecy and more are common here. These romantic dramas of attraction, proposals, jealousy, reconciliation are features of this game. This game stands in contrast to the formal rules of marriage where women are constrained by the patriarchal family and economic system.

```ad-quote
"In addition to the female-to-female interactions so far considered, mummy-baby relations provide a training situation through which older girls help to introduce their juniors into the world of heterosexual relationships." (108)


```

It is accepted that a mummy may have several babies, or that a multi-generational chain can be found. The rules of the game are based on the biological nature of the uterine but transactional aspects are equally important - babies receive gifts, help advice but are expected to return undivided loyalty and affection.

Asymmetrical gift exchange suggest a similarity to conjugal relations - in Lesotho, marriage is based on emotional attraction between peers, initiated by a dominant male and involves economic ties and sexual relations.

Girls can be involved with a boyfriend, become pregnant and even get married whilst still being a mummy - occasionally boys participate in the game as "sonnys" or "daddys". Most Basotho informants were shocked at the idea that sexual relations could exist between a mother and son - that this is wrong since or due to incest taboos or may be confusing their roles.

Needless to say, boys were involved in these relationships and helped provide sweets, gifts and more to the baby. Not all daddys are friendly though - they may destroy the female dyad by making sexual advances to the younger girls. 

```ad-quote
"Thus, although the mummy-baby game can postpone or replace relations with boys for a time, it can also introduce participants to heterosexuality." (110)


```

The mummy-baby game points to features of female sexuality and affective relations that challenge western assumptions:
1. The compatibility of these intimate female relations with heterosexuality challenges our western insistence on polarising homosexuality and heterosexuality.
2. There is a growing body of literature on the nature of female sexuality and difference between gendered attitudes limited by non-western data: these female mummy-baby relations are structured differently from sexual relations among men in the enforced all-male living conditions of South African mine compounds.
