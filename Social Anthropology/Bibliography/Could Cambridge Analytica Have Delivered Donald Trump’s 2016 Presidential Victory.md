## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
I first provide some context about Cambridge Analytica’s (ca) activities, linking them to ca parent company, scl Group, which specialised in “public relations” campaigns around the world across multiple sectors (from politics to defence and development), with the explicit aim of behavioural change. I then analyse in more detail the claims made by mathematician and machine learning scholar David Sumpter, who dismisses the possibility that ca might have successfully deployed internet psychographics (e.g. online personality profiling) in the winning 2016 Trump presidential campaign in the US. I critique his arguments, pointing at the need to focus on the bigger picture and on the totality of ca methods, rather than analysing psychographics in isolation. This is followed by a section where I use ca whistleblower Christopher Wylie’s 2019 memoir to show the important role that in-depth qualitative research and methods akin ethnographic immersion might have played in building ca big data capabilities. I provide an angle on big data that sees it as complementary, rather than in opposition to, human insight that comes from qualitative immersion in the social realities targeted by ca. The concluding section discusses additional questions that should be explored to gain a deeper understanding of how big data is changing political campaigning, with an emphasis on the important contribution that anthropology can make to these crucial debates.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

How did Trump bungle the pandemic so hard and yet still convince his supporters that the US response to the pandemic was going well, and that the US economy was in good condition?

### Cambridge Analytica, Data Campaigning and the Future of the Human

CA operations should not been as a sensationalist story of 'rogue' scientists "but rather as an effort to advance common techniques of contemporary digital capitalism such as audience segmentation and microtargeting in the field of election campaigning." (144)

"Psychographics are discussed towards the end, in a section on email advertising. Here it is claimed that ca tested its ocean psychographics with two email campaigns. 74 One email had a subject line that “was designed to be reassuring to people who ordinarily might have a propensity to worry” – it read “Preserve Freedom and Overcome Hillary’s Candidacy” and was crafted with voters scoring high on neuroticism in mind. The email was sent to a group of people who scored high on neuroticism and another group who did not. The first group had 20% higher open rates than the second." (135)

"The second email campaign targeted only people scoring high on neuroticism, and had three types of email subject – one with a reassuring message (for example, “Calm the storm, stop Hillary”), another one with a fear-driven message (for example, “Electing Hillary destroys our nation”), and a last one with a generic message (for example, “Information from Make America Number 1”). The fear-based subject line had 10% higher open rate than the generic one, and 20% more opens than the reassuring one.

The report concludes that “[t]hese email campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of psychographic profiling for enhancing email marketing campaigns.” (136)

Algorithms can find patterns that don't require theory.

"If that were not enough, in 2014 ca allegedly started to experiment with the
Covert creation of pages and groups on Facebook and other social media testing campaign messages, without declaring the real owners and administrators, or their algorithmic work. When a critical mass of members or followers was reached, administrators and troll accounts would suggest physical meet-ups that would further invigorate, and often inflame targets, in a highly invasive process of behavioural change, without any real knowledge from the targets of the experiments they became part of “in the wild.” We do not know whether such experiments were carried out during the 2016 Trump election campaign, but there is no reason to exclude such possibility" (139)
