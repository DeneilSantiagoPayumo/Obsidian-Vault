**This considers the people from [[Brazil]], specifically Salvador.**

## Article Introduction

>[!summary]
>I will argue that the sexual divison that researchers have noted between those who penetrate and those who are penetrated extends far beyond sexual interactions between males to constitute the basis of the *gender division* in Latin America. Gender is not grounded not so much in sex ... as it is grounded in sexuality.
>
>Gender in Latin America should be seen not as consisting of men and women, but rather of men and not-men, the latter being a category into which both biological females and males who enjoy anal penetration are culturally situated.

This argument will be drawn from the Brazilian city of Salvador, among a group of males who enjoy anal penetration - effeminized prostitutes known as *travestis*.

The single most defining characteristic about travestis is their bodies - travesties do not merely don female attributes but incorporate them. Young boys inject themselves with female hormones to give themselves female features, medication to combat oestrogen deficiency or pills to prevent pregnancy. These pills are easy to acquire.

Eventually the travestis will inject silicone after side effects emerge to give fleshy thighs, hips and 'bunda' (buttocks). The majority of travestis do not have silicone as they believe it will cause cancer, because they believe that injections are painful, are waiting for implants or are satisfied with the size of their breasts.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The body in context

There's a strong consensus among travestis in Salvador that any travestis who claim to be a woman is mentally disturbed - they cannot be a woman and never will be. Any attempt to change what God did to them is impossible and result in madness.

They modify their bodies hence to be 'feminine' and 'like a woman'. They wanted the attraction to men, and felt attracted to men. Also, female forms help attract money through prostitutes.

But what about the penis? Almost every travesti values her penis and many admire it. However, they keep it hidden and 'imprisoned' - pulling it down between their legs and pressing it against their perineum with their under panties. Also, a travesti may have a *marido* (a live in boyfriend), attractive young men with no jobs and are supported by the travesti. They are not considered homosexual and are regarded as men.

One of the defining attributes of being a **homem** in the gender system that the travestis draw on and invoke is that a man will not be interested in another male's penis. A man, in this interpretative framework, will happily penetrate another male's anus. But he will not touch or express any desire for another male's penis. For him to do so would be tantamount to relinquishing his status as a man. (577)

Travestis want their boyfriends to be men and not homosexuals - they want them to be symbolically different from themselves. They themselves do not want the men to express interest in their penis, become concerned about their orgasm or wish to be anally penetrated.

On the street however, travestis' are prized for their big penises. They are wanted to anally penetrate others. They even stop taking hormones because they want to penetrate.

### Why inject silicone?

There may be social and economic considerations - a body full of silicone translates into cash. Males however do not become travestis because they are sexually abused, or because they have no other choice to find employment as openly effeminate homosexual men to find employment.

Also, in social and economic terms, the sexual marketplace does not require male prostitutes to be travestis - see male prostitutes called *miches*. Even transgendered prostitutes do not require radical body modifications that travestis undertake.

Additionally, travestis do not need to have sex with their clients - rather for a large part of their income, they just rob them by pick pocketing the client, assaulting him or threatening to create a public scandal. It is possible to derive money from prostitution and not consume hormones or inject silicone.


Travestis frequently refer to biological males by using feminine pronouns and feminine adjectival endings - this classificatory system is subtle and complex, travestis narrating their lives will use masculine pronouns when discussing themselves as children but switch to feminine when referring to their present-day lives. Clients are referred to as 'she' but the same client will be referred to with different gendered pronouns depending on the actions they perform. (579)

There is no third sex here - travestis only arise based on a strict dichotomy. They have a different gender system. Here, the gender system is not based on genitals, but rather on sexuality.

It depends on actions - those that want to be anally penetrated disqualifies them from being men and makes them into *viados* like the travestis themselves. Travestis dismiss gay men as pretending to be gay. As a gay man, the author is assumed to be akin to be the same as them. The author does not disguise themselves or modify their bodies, but they're still women all the same.

This explains why most travestis do not wish to have an operation - they are already equivalent to women. A sex-change operation culturally speaking would not give her anything. Simply put, they share a gender with women even though they are not women themselves.

```ad-quote
The desire to be attractive for persons of the opposite gender puts pressure on individuals to attempt to approximate cultural ideals of beauty, thereby dawing them into patriarchal and heterosexual imperatives that guide aesthetic values and that frame the direction and the content of the erotic gaze ... [travestis] appropriate and incorporate the ideals of beuaty that tehir culture offers them in order to be attractive to men. (581)
