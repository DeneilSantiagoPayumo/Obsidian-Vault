## Article Introduction

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

```ad-abstract
Examining conspiracy theory authors has not been seen as worthy of ethnographic inquiry in anthropology as of yet. This is intriguing, as encountering conspiracy theorists inspires a process of reassessing the critical nature of our own discipline, with its doubting mechanisms and thrill for alternative realities, and the essay offers analogies between such theories and the discipline. This article tackles conspiracy theory through ethnographically encountering the people largely responsible for the creation and dissemination of such theories. I argue that ethnography of conspiracy theory is ethnography on and with conspiracy theorists. The essay responds to recent calls to address uncomfortable ideas ‘at eye level’. Such calls to take seriously people who adhere to challenging ideas comes from work among far-right thinkers, an area sometimes converging with conspiracy theory. Reviewing material from fieldwork in Greece among authors in the conspiracy genre illuminates a wide array of concerns, from the idea that their work is science-worthy to statements both associated and dissociated from fascist ideas. The essay shows how professionals of the conspiracy theory field craft such theories and (re)work their own social standing, while I take conspiracy theory arbiters’ claims to the epistemic seriously and explore their relations to the far-right.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Ethnography Among the 'Truthers'

Three kinds of empirics:
1. Outcome of a cognitive derivative of ethnographic fieldwork

Their conspiratorial narratives vary, spanning global conspiracies to stories ingrained in the national contingency. These authors attract a multi-generational readership. 

2. Material seen in internet forums, websites, blogs and social media pages.

They embrace the branding and identify their craft as a means to talk about the political. Their craft are unconventional and radical way to talk about 'the political'.

3. Exposure from informal flows of information regarding conspiracy.

### The Theorists Behind the Theory 

The idea of truth-activism: conspiracy theory, for Kodros (publisher) is 'a marginalised way to read reality that has *something to do with politics*' - it speaks truth to power.

```ad-quote
title: 2015 interview with Velopoulos
An author mainly writes from his soul, while a researcher mainly from the mind. I write mainly from the soul, from the heart, but with facts. I am doing the research and expose the facts in order to demonstrate and prove that those things I believe in are indeed how things are. And the other, the reader, has the burden of proof. When I have a sense of the truth, I go out in books to find it, until I’ve found it.
```

```ad-quote
title: 53, the anthropologist's point of view.
The dazzling point on finding truth here is unwittingly referring to a classic quote from Mein Kampf, where truth-finding reality is established on a reversed burden of proof, which lies with the reader, rather than with the author. That is, ‘it is not I who need to explain and prove; the plain fact that power is afraid of what I am saying and tries to disapprove it, implies I am right’.
```

Conspiracy theories are often embolden with the validity of actual truth - what he does is science, is cited in Harvard. The real trope here is 'truth' associated with 'science'.

```ad-quote
title: 54, Arinakis on truth and conspiracy theories
The associations with paradigm shifts in science are startling – underlining that conspiracism is both a discipline based on work and an art based on inspiration. Importantly, Arinakis seems aware of a major epistemological premise for positivist science, ‘limitations’, while he bemoans what he calls the ‘republican fanaticism’ of scientists that debunk conspiracy theories.

Most conspiracist views about the cosmological ramifications of this 'reality' are not only different but also very diverse and contrarian.

### 'The Truth Is Out There': Conspiracy and Anthropology / Reclaimin Theory

It is a desperate search for a hidden reality, all it does is offer an alternative to 'mainstream' science. In fact, anthropology's claim to empirical knowledge shares a cognitive impulse with conspiracy theory: anthropologists and conspiracy theorists search for truths, for modes of thinking 'out there', among the Others. In the process ... They are conditioned by this alterity in building up knowledge. (55)

```ad-quote
title: 57, about reclaiming theory
The ethnographic encounter among the truthers (Kay 2011) brings the anthropology of conspiracy theory amidst the social basis of these alternative political theories to witness the knowledge production of conspiracism. However, shedding light on a conspiracy of secret connections to fabricate ‘alternative’ scenarios of causation is of course not unique to this type of theory. While many theories claim to be ‘alternative’, in the sense of original or radical, in their take on social reality (anthropological theory might be one example), their defining characteristic is not that they are ‘alternative’. This condition is, rather, an outcome of their marginality within the system of hegemony in the public sphere.

That system of hegemony might often ascribe to ‘truthful’ knowledge a primary position in the hierarchy of cognition (see for instance Fritze 2009). However, many people recognise alternative forms of knowledge when they demand transparency from their government (Davis 2017: 154).

#### Other things:
Looking into the Thessaloniki milieu, however, shows that conspiracists make claims – if not appeals – to degrees of hegemonic epistemic validity for their theories rather than magic-like processes. Because of this audacity, they face mechanisms of epistemic power that distinguish conspiracy theories from scholarly theories. The recognition of this epistemic power is the source of [Pelkmans and Machold's (2011)](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/saas/30/1/saas300104.xml#bib29) critique to Sanders and West's (2003) relativist position that levels the epistemic and the conspiratorial worlds. Pelkmans and Machold are principally concerned with how truth and untruth are produced in asymmetrical fields of power/knowledge: for them, while some conspiracy theories are nonsense, others correctly identify secretly colluding powers (2011: 73). While I am indifferent to whether what my Thessalonikian interlocutors write and say is ‘nonsense’, I agree that we need to interrogate systematically the links between power and truth (2011: 68), as the classificatory mechanisms of ‘valid’ and ‘veridical’ knowledge are certainly products of asymmetrical power plays. The power of labelling has specific normative effects that can render a critical theory obsolete by classifying it as a ‘conspiracy theory’ ([Pelkmans and Machold 2011: 74–75](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/saas/30/1/saas300104.xml#bib29); cf. [Harambam and Aupers 2017](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/saas/30/1/saas300104.xml#bib9); Fassin 2021).

Indeed, instead of far-right clichés on Jews and Masons, the real trope in conspiratorial narratives here is ‘truth’, a term often associated with ‘science’. Take Arinakis, for example: while claiming that science is as open to interpretation as fiction is, and that we live in an era of epistemic dictatorship (what he calls ‘the fundamentalism of the lab’), he would, however, occasionally in our conversations utilise an epistemic reductionism. According to his own admittance, his references to ‘dreaming of alternative scenarios’ were founded on Freudian and Deep Ecology scholarship. He would routinely remind me that conspiracies are ‘not that crazy, really. They are truths that wait to be broadly recognised, much like Galileo's idea that the Earth is moving’. The associations with paradigm shifts in science are startling – underlining that conspiracism is both a discipline based on work and an art based on inspiration. Importantly, Arinakis seems aware of a major epistemological premise for positivist science, ‘limitations’, while he bemoans what he calls the ‘republican fanaticism’ of scientists that debunk conspiracy theories:

> a revolutionary committee is in power, the doubtful mechanisms instilled by modernity. The kings are dead. The French Revolution has taken over the world. The ‘reasoned’ are in power. But where is sense? Where are the solutions that they, the ‘reasoned’, the science-centred, had promised us? No king to blame, so why would no one blame their own limitations?[](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/saas/30/1/saas300104.xml#)

It is central to underscore that most conspiracist views about the cosmological ramifications of this ‘reality’ are not only different, but also richly diverse, and indeed contrarian to each other. In this internal strife, interlocutors were routinely associating fellow conspiracists with the two tropes of the Hofstadterian thesis (paranoia and the far-right). Therefore, ‘paranoid’ is used as a pejorative to describe a competitor theorist and the term ‘fascist’ as a way to debunk the validity of one's claims. In discussion with me, Arinakis used the terms, ‘paranoid’ and ‘far-right’ to describe Monkakis, while both called Velopoulos ‘a fascist’. All three had bad things to say about Dakopoulos, another major Thessalonikian conspiracy theorist and by 2015 standards arguably the most appealing in all Greece. All the above called Varkidis, another author, ‘a crook’, while Arinakis pointed out that Varkidis is also ‘a crazy fascist’.

It is common among conspiracists and other fringe groups to have conflicts and accusations of being traitors, agents or of being plainly irrelevant; Freud called this the narcissism of minor differences ([Blok 1998](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/saas/30/1/saas300104.xml#bib4)). Paying attention to the diversified cosmos of conspiracism helps to demystify and de-essentiale this milieu, and links it to a sociological characteristic of political groups: factionalism. This way we also take these discourses seriously (see [Pasieka 2019](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/saas/30/1/saas300104.xml#bib28)), as matters of inquiry stemming from conscious agents. Conspiracists themselves often prioritise their radical break from other conspiracies, which they find more important than any break from a ‘rational’ reality.
