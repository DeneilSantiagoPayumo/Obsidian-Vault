"Conspiracy theories are one way of dealing with gaps between hopes and reality, between the visible and the hidden, and between expert and lay knowledge. They often start as a way of making sense of misfortune, whether a dramatic national event, an eco-logical disaster, or a health crisis in one’s family. The assumption is that some actors have intentionally conspired to cause such harms for their own benefit. Conspiracy theories concern disasters affecting individuals, but they may also be connected to perceptions of persecution against a way of life; against whole ethnic, racial, or religious groups; or against social categories such as women, men, or children. They are meaning systems that either explain or make sense of specific events or of social, political, or economic systems of power." (1)

They try to address the presence of good and evil, and thus are frequently connected to cosmologies. They can be fruitfully be scrutinized *as* or *in* cosmology.

For *as*: explain and make sense of suffering with reference to intentional evil actions of a hidden power. Combatants are locked in a worldly battle with kind and evil forces.

In most parts of the world, apocalyptic or extreme ethnonationalist political movements weave conspiracy theories into their cosmological systems. They attempt to expose hidden power and articulate social and political criticism.

"Focusing on politics, human agency, and knowledge, they diagnose the symptoms of the malaise and make claims about the cure at the same time. Thus, conspiracy theories often generate actions destructive for individuals or groups." (2).

They can be understood as therapeutic talk. The author references [[Stewart and Harding]] who argue that conflicting discourses on religion, science and technology provides a master narrative for anxiety - neurasthenia.

"Thus, the promise of transparency goes hand in hand with increased conspiracism. The more information is revealed or available, the more we suspect that something is still hidden. Thus, the promise of more open political and economic relations has for many people created a world that seems increasingly opaque, where hidden and secret actors collaborate for evil purposes." (3)

Conspiracy theories are not only about what we do not know but also about what we cannot forget. They have the power not only to reveal hidden associations but also to disturb opaque official narratives. For that reason, conspiracy theories thrive in divided societies, where the same events can be interpreted in diametrically different ways (see Moore and Sanders 2002). Conspiracy theories can fruitfully be analyzed as arenas for conflicts over issues that are of particular importance for people in a given society. Conspiracy theories can hence be interpreted as other than an anxious reaction to the great frameworks of contemporary times: post modernity, globalization, neoliberal capitalism, and so on. The truth claims in conspiracy theories are often disputable, or impossible to verify, yet for anthropologists conspiracy theories offer an important entry point to learn about topics of urgent importance for particular societies
