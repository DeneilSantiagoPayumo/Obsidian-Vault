1973 [[Clifford Geertz]] - [[Interpretivism and Structuralism]]

311 The concept of culture ... is essentially a semiotic one. Believing, with [[Max Weber]] that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning.

If you want to understand what a science is, you need to look at what the practitioners of it do.

In anthropology, what anthropologists do is ethnography. It is understanding what ethnography is, or what doing ethnography is, that a start can be made towards grasping anthropological analysis.

From one point of view, that of the textbook, doing ethnography is establishing rapport, selecting informants, transcribing texts, taking genealogies, mapping fields, keeping a diary and so on. This defines the enterprise.

What defines the intellectual effort is - to borrow from Gilbert Ryle, "this description".

```ad-example
title: An example of thick description - winking

Ryle's discussion: two boys rapidly contracting the eyelids. In one, this is an involuntary twitch, the other a conspiratorial signal to a friend.

The two movements are identical, one could not tell which was twitch and which was wink. The difference however is that the winker is communicating in a specific way, to someone in particular, to impart a particular message, according to a socially established code and without the cognizance of the rest of the company.

Contracting your eyelids on purpose when there exists a public code in which so doing counts as a conspiratorial signal *is* winking - a speck fo behaviour, a fleck of culture and thene, a gesture!

Suppose there's aa third boy who parodies the first boy's wink - not only is he not winking or twitching, he is parodying someone else's attempt at winking, sending a message.

If others think he is winking then his whole project misfires. One can go further: uncertain of his abilities, the winker may practice at home, rehearsing - rapidly contracting his right eyelids as all the others.

Complexities are possible - the original winker may have been winking.

But the point is clear: there's the thin description of what the rehearser is doing (rapidly contracting his right eyelid) and thick description (practicing a burlesque of a friend faking a wink to decieve an innocent into thinking a conspiracy is in motion).

Therein lies the object of ethnography - a hierarchy of meaningful structures in terms of which twitches, winks, fake-winks are produced, perceived and interpreted.

This shows how much actually goes into ethnographic description - what we call our data are really our own constructions of other people's constructions of what they and their compatriots are up to, and this is obscured because most of what we need to comprehend a particular event, ritual, custom, idea or whatever is insinuated as background information.

It leads to a view of anthropological research as more of an observation and less of an interpretive activity.

Analysis is sorting out the structures of signification and determining their social ground and import - sorting needs to begin with distinguishing three unlike frames of interpretation ingredients in the situation and move how their copresence produces a situation in which system in which systematic misunderstanding reduced traditional form to social force.

What the ethnographer is faced with is the pursuit of the more automatized routines of data collection, a multiplicity of complex conceptual structures. And this is true of the most down-to-earth field work levels of his activity: interviewing informants, observing rituals, eliciting kin terms.

Doing ethnography is like trying to read a manuscript - foreign, faded, full of ellipses, incoherence, suspicious emendations.

Culture, this acted document, thus is public - does not exist in someone's head, though unphysical, it is not an occult entity. Once human behaviour is seen as a symbolic action, the question is as so whether culture is a patterned conduct or a frame of mind, even if the two are mixed together, begins to lose sense.

The thing is to ask what their import is: what it is, ridicule or challenge, irony or anger, snobbery or pride.

There are many ways to obscure it.
One is to think of culture as a self-contained "super-organic" reality with forces and purposes of its own. Another is to claim that it consists in the brute pattern of behavioural events we observe in fact to occur in some community, to reduce it.

Variously called cognitive anthropology, this school of thought holds culture as composed of psychological structures by which individuals guide their behaviour - and the view of culture follows a view equally assured for a native. In such a way, extreme subjectivism is married to extreme formalism, with the expected result: an explosion of debates as to whether analyses reflect what the natives "really" think.

Culture is public because meaning is. You can't wink without knowing what counts as winking. You can't conduct a sheep raid without knowing how it is to steal a sheep.

To draw from such truths that the conclusion that knowing how to wink is winking and knowing how to steal a sheep is sheep raiding is thin description - a cognitivist fallacy that culture consists of 'mental phenomena' analysed by formal methods.

Finding our feet is what ethnographic research consists of - personal experience, trying to formulate the basis on which one imagines.

Looked at in this way, the aim of anthropology is the enlargement of the universe of human discourse - an aim to which a semiotic concept of culture is particularly well adapted. As interworked systems of construable signs, culture is not a power to which social events can be causally attributed.

Descriptions of Jewish or French culture must be cast in terms of the constructions we imagine them to be - the formulae they use to define what happens to them. It does not mean that such descriptions themselves are Berber, Jewish or French. They must be cast in terms of the interpretations to which persons of a particular denomination subject their experience.

In short, anthropological writings are themselves interpretations, and second and third order to boot. They are thus fictions, in the sense they are "something made" or "something fashioned."

Cultural systems must have a minimal degree of coherence or else we would not call them systems. The force of our interpretations cannot be hold on the tightness which they hold together.

If anthropological interpretation is constructing a reading of what happens, to divorce it from what happens - from what, in this time or that place - is to divorce it from its applications and render it vacant. A good interpretation of anything takes us into the heart of that. When it does not do anything, it is defunct.

What does the ethnographer do - the standard answer is that "he observes, he records, he analyses."

318

Three characteristics of ethnographic description: it is interpretive, what it is interpretive of is the flow of social discourse, and the interpreting involved consists in trying to rescue the "said" of such discourse from what is involved.

There is also a fourth characteristic - it is microscopic. We can't get a massive in-depth story of people's lives without it as such.

The notion that one can find the essence of national societies, civilizations ... in small town and villages is palpable nonsense. Hat one finds in small towns and villages is small-town or village life.

The famous studies purporting to show that that the Oedipus complex was backwards in the Trobrian, sex roles were upside down in Tchambuli and so on are not "scientifically tested and approved" hypotheses - they are interpretations, arrived in the same way as any others, and any attempt at investing them with authority is a methodological sleight of hand.

The methodological problem is real and critical. It is resolved by realising that social actions are comments on more than themselves, that where an interpretation comes from does not determine where it can be impelled to go.

The besetting sin of interpretive approaches to anything is that they tend to resist conceptual articulation - you either grasp an interpretation or not, accept it or not, be self-validating or just validating in the sensitivities of the person.

It must be admitted that there are a number of characteristics that make theoretical development of it difficult: the need for theory to stay closer to the ground.

The whole point of a semiotic approach is to gain access to the conceptual world. The first condition for cultural theory - it is not its own master.

Cultural analysis breaks up into a disconnected and coherent of bolder and bolder sorties - studies do build on others, and better informed, they plunge more deeply into the same things.

Rather than beginning with a set of observations and subsuming them into governing law, such inference begins with signifiers and attempts to place them within a frame. Measures are matched to theoretical predictions and symptoms are scanned for theoretical peculiarities.

The second condition of cultural theory: it is not predictive. Theoretical ideas are not created wholly anew in each study, they are adopted from related studies and applied to new interpretive problems.

Such a theory suggests that the distinction appears in the experimental sciences between "description" and "explanation" appears here as one, between "inscription" (thick description) and "specification" (diagnosis).

Our task is to uncover the conceptual structures that inform our subject's acts, and to construct a system of analysis whose terms are generic to those structures. The aim is to draw large conclusions from small facts, supporting broad assertations about the role of culture in the construction of collective life.

Anthropology is a science whose progress is marked less by a perfection of consensus than by a refinement of debate.

The author is not impressed by the argument that complete objectivity is impossible as of course it is, so one should let sentiments run loose.

The main danger is that cultural analysis will lose touch with the hard surface of life and with the biological and physical necessities on which those surfaces rest. The only defence against it is to turn cultural analysis into a kind of sociological aestheticism.

We must make available to us answers that others have given, including them in the consultable record of what man says.
