### Detailed account of the texture of the democracy of direct action as experienced in the daily assemblies of Occupy Slovenia

Reading a diary:

```ad-quote
title: 242
The buoyant tone of the diary reflects the expansive mood of activists who—after years of organizing alongside migrant and minority groups in Slovenia, organizing that led to the marginalization of activism and even, at times, its public vilification—find radical activism to be much more popular suddenly. They understood this newfound public support in relation to a political disorientation in Slovenia. The goals that oriented public life for two decades—economic liberalization, European integration, and democratic consolidation—had lost their self-evidence in the face of the political and economic crisis.

..

By stressing “No one represents us,”“Real democracy now,” and “Que se vayan todos”[They all must go], as well as bemoaning the consequences of the “monopoly of ‘democratic parties’ over political life,” activists positioned Occupy Slovenia as a response to a crisis of representative democracy in Slovenia.

...

Again, by positioning themselves in front of the Stock Exchange rather than addressing national institutions, either symbolically in a historic space like Congress Square or literally before parliament, as protest traditionally has in Slovenia, activists sidestepped the state and directly engaged financial institutions, not, it should be noted, as a populist defense of the local against foreign capital. On the contrary, many activists embraced the ways that the financial crisis brought them together with movements elsewhere struggling against financial institutions. Finally, activists marked a transition from protest—which objects to current conditions and is often directed toward making requests of powerful actors—to resistance with the formation of the assembly, a collective body that enables activists to decide and act together.

Migrants from various backgrounds were an important constituency in Occupy Slovenia. Here are the ways in which the democracy of direct action opened a space for minority participation ... Aso by those with minority political positions or groups.

**First, I pressed Andrej on the question of what the limits of political participation in Occupy Slovenia might be.** That is, within the **framework of the democracy of direct action, with power residing in the workshops, what would prevent initiatives that are fundamentally hostile to the movement from co-opting it**? **All workshops are to abide by the framing principles adopted** when the encampment was declared on October 15, Andrej explained, by organizations like the Invisible Workers of the World, the Union of Crane Operators, Social Center Rog, We Are the University, and an Alternative Exists. **These principles include opposition to financial bailouts and austerity, rejection of political representation, and contribution to the development of an autonomous movement and solidarity**. When a leader of the Party of Youth-Greens (SMS-Zeleni), for example, tried to participate in the occupied Faculty of Arts Assembly as part of his party's preelection campaign, Andrej continued, **he was booed into silence and told not to return as a party representative, though he was welcome as a human being**. How would the movement respond to a populist anti-immigrant initiative? “Look, first, you’ve seen how many migrant initiatives are represented here, the Erased, Invisible Workers of the World, and the workers dormitory strike,” Andrej responded, “**so we’ve created a clear profile that is inhospitable to the politics of hate**."

Second, I wondered what would prevent centrifugal forces from undoing Occupy Slovenia. **Was there not a tendency for people to self-select into workshops of like-minded people**? Was there not a danger, especially in light of the sectarian tensions that marred the alter-globalization movement in Slovenia and elsewhere, of groups spinning off from Occupy Slovenia and no longer returning to assemblies, no longer engaging with those who were different than they? Well, Andrej admitted,

> this is a very real danger, and there have at times been signs of such centrifugal tendencies. We don't know where this will lead. **For the moment, however, I’d say two elements counter this tendency**. First, in creating a camp in front of the Stock Exchange, **we’ve clearly defined a common enemy, an enemy that many of us can link directly to the conditions of our daily lives, the nature of our employment, the debts we can't pay**. But second, **that camp is also a common resource we are governing together. Not of course just the physical camp, though that is crucial**. I mean we recently discussed the possibility of closing the camp because it's just so exhausting to sustain it in this [late December] weather, but many felt that it was what linked us in some fundamental ways. And, from the discussion, it was clear that the camp was the **physical manifestation of the broader common resource of the movement, the profile we’ve built publicly, but also the new forms of social relations we’ve produced collectively around that camp**.

### A minoritarian history of social movements in Slovenia


```ad-quote
title: 247-248
These experiences, **both of the dangers of majoritarian politics and of the sense that certain forms of organization and advocacy stifle the initiatives of the most marginalized**, led radicals to develop **the democracy of direct action as a framework that allowed for encounter and collaboration** among varied initiatives under the Occupy Slovenia umbrella but nonetheless maximized the diversity and protagonizem of individual initiatives or workshops within Occupy Slovenia.[26](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#en26) To be clear, our earlier contrasting of the democracy of direct action and consensus models was not meant to imply that decision-making practices like those adopted by OWS do not protect the rights of minorities. Indeed, **consensus processes**, which require the consent of those who hold minority positions, **can be quite effective in protecting minority voices—though this is less true of modified consensus**. Within the framework of the democracy of direct action, however, it is possible to act from minority positions, even to take actions that may not be popular among the majority.

After looking over the above history we had written, Andrej was left with the nagging sense we had neglected something essential about the quality of the democracy of direct action and what had motivated its development. To be sure, the above history **demonstrates why activists would be decidedly ambivalent about majoritarian and populist accounts of the Occupy Movement**. So, even though the slogan “We are the 99%” was sometimes heard in Ljubljana, it always had unwanted nationalist overtones for those of us who spent years working alongside Slovenia's 1%—the Erased. Similarly, statements like those OWS issued in the name of “the people, united” (#OccupyWallStreet New York General Assembly 2011) had unwanted nationalist overtones for activists in Slovenia. For Andrej, invoking the people _(narod)_ always implied the forging of new sovereignties that might, in turn, either exclude or hierarchically include those marked as minorities.

But all this, Andrej complained, **makes the democracy of direct action sound as if it is only a reaction against the dangers of sovereignty—hard lessons learned from discrimination**. For us, however, **it is also a positive affirmation not only of the marginalized and the minority but also of minoritarian politics as the organization that will be expansive and ever more inclusive rather than disciplining or normalizing those who participate**. At the center of this organization is the figure of the minoritarian as a universal figure, in the Deleuzian sense of becoming everybody and everything.[27](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#en27)

### Workshop for Direct Social Work

Problems with social media:

```ad-quote
title: 248-9
**The argument that is emerging is that the regulations in place serve to prevent many from accessing the funds they are entitled to, that the controls often cost more than they save, and the social assistance that is given is therefore significantly smaller than it could be because of this bureaucracy**. The relationship of social workers to users, moreover, already one of discipline and stigmatization rather than collaboration—as both social workers and users in the workshop testify from their distinct experiences—is further deteriorating in the face of the sovereign debt crisis and consequent austerity policies. Despite relatively small public debt and deficits, Slovenia is forced to follow the dictates of the financial markets and implement policies similar to those of states pejoratively designated as the PIGS (originally, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain, but now often expanded to include other states). The policy changes being made affect social workers and users more than perhaps any others in society. “Social workers are always in offices,” says one young social worker, “we’re always filling out paper work. We are not meeting with users in the daily conditions in which they struggle.”

Marta proposes, and others quickly embrace, **a demand for a complete overhaul of state policies: a basic welfare package of €550 ($698) that would be guaranteed to all instead of the current regime of interlocking programs for those deemed needy within a complex range of rubrics**. Perhaps there should be means testing at the very upper end of incomes, perhaps not; this remains unresolved. By the end of the meeting, activists draw up plans for direct action against the Ministry of Work, Family and Social Affairs; the Center for Social Work; and the Ljubljana Public Housing Fund. The actions must be grounded, Marta reminds us, in the personal experience of social workers and users, not in abstractions of social critique


```

Remarkable, but many central tensions:

```ad-quote
title: 249-250
Although I found the dynamics I saw within Direct Social Work workshops remarkable, especially their capacity to create settings for collaboration across significant differences, I was, nonetheless, left with the nagging sense that they were also **a particularly striking example of a central tension implicit in the workings of the democracy of direct action**, a tension that was not being acknowledged by participants. Is there not a contradiction in the Occupy Slovenia movement, I asked Marta after one Direct Social Work workshop, between, on the one hand, **the declared rupture with representative democracy**, the effort to start rebuilding society through **practices of direct democracy that encourage encounters between differences and becomings**, and, on the other hand, **the continued use of terms such as _welfare_ or the development** of _demands_ for policy changes addressed to the state?

...

What Marta was laying out, in other words, was a belief that the process of changing one's circumstances begins with **a critical description of the limits and frustrations of one's current predicament and continues with the struggle to change this predicament**. Through this critical yet empirical analysis—carried out collectively, in a time and place of their own choosing—Direct Social Work participants have in essence already embarked on the **transformation of these conditions and their social relations**.

...

It is possible to:
> to use a discourse of rights without falling into state-centered politics. There is no necessary contradiction, in fact, between claiming rights while trying to construct stateless sociabilities and communities. Direct democracy for us means that we reject the transfer of rights and powers to any sovereign. **So we have to find new ways to produce rights—by defining them such that we simultaneously build our power to realize them**. This is a politics of small steps that accumulate new forms of alternative power that can be used in the war being waged globally by financial institutions, markets and the institutions of representative democracy against our generation. In this sense, becoming in Occupy Slovenia is not understood as originating in some imaginary point of perfect freedom. It is more related to the Foucauldian notion of freedom as an expansive threshold … The goal of action is not freedom itself but processes of liberation, the struggle to resist the actual conditions in which we find ourselves today. In this sense, the process of producing together new claims, new rights like those that Direct Social Work articulates, is as important as the content of the rights.


What Andrej is describing is a radically different understanding of rights than one encounters within classical liberal theory ([Kurnik 2011](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#b51)). What he envisions are not natural rights, God given or otherwise, which we have by belonging to the human race (human rights), or legal rights, which we have as citizens of a state, democratic or otherwise, that has guaranteed these rights constitutionally (civil rights). **These are rights, instead, that are produced collectively, that we possess only insofar as we have the capacity to assert them socially, only insofar as we build together with others the collective capacities to exercise them**.[32](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#en32) They derive, Andrej insists, from the **Spinozan right of aggregated people who claim nothing less than the right of God, which is absolutely free** ([Spinoza 2002](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#b80):683; cf. [Speed 2008](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#b79)).[33](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#en33) Maybe this understanding of rights sounds nebulous, Andrej concedes, when pressed. “What would the right to housing look like concretely in our terms? Well, we’ve begun to challenge the banks’ authority to evict, as have the movements in the U.S. We should move on to squat vacant bank-owned properties and distribute them to those most in need. **We will govern this resource in common together, assuring that empty homes don't go unused**. Hey, we love the Boj za encampment, but it should not be the best we have to offer the homeless.”

Whereas most activists movements would, of course, define themselves as seeking social change, Occupy Slovenia is one of those very rare social forms that is engaged in **self-conscious processes of becoming-other-than-it-now-is in an open-ended manner**, both in terms of encounters with difference and collective struggles against existing conditions (cf. [Besteman 2008](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#b5)).

As these articulations of being and becoming are, therefore, inextricably entangled, what we want to highlight are the political and theoretical limitations of theorizing direct action and direct democracy as primarily prefigurative—especially the ways they limit our ability to explicitly analyze and even valorize the process of becoming. The shift in Ljubljana toward an emphasis on becoming highlights some of these implications. **First, activists have explicitly tried to ground their critique, and the articulation of the possibilities of change in their current circumstances, from within the contradictory predicaments in which they now find themselves lodged. Rather than seeing direct action, as Graeber has described it, as the “defiant insistence on acting as if one is already free” (2011) or expressing hope in an eventual telos of freedom, activists around Occupy Slovenia are engaging in a messy, and, some activists stressed, never-ending liberation struggle**. Second, the practices of Occupy Slovenia facilitate encounters with difference that **allow for a becoming-other-than-one-now-is**. In other words, the fruit of the democracy of direct action as political practice grows in unexpected ways from the soil of countless hours of dialogue, bickering, and common struggle—among social workers and users, precariously employed researchers and migrant laborers, students, professors, rent-striking construction workers, outsourced Bosnian dockworkers, and Erased waiters.[36](https://anthrosource-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01361.x#en36) Third, **prefiguration implies that we know in advance what form struggles can take—which has echoes of a kind of utopian telos, no matter how near at hand. The practice of the democracy of direct action itself indicates that direct democracy must be conceived of as an open-ended process that will involve unexpected new forms. In this spirit, movement organization and decision making themselves must be submitted to critical reflection, must be opened to a process of becoming**. To quote L. A. Kauffman, the Occupy Movement “has opened up for questioning so much that was previously taken as given. May it do the same with its own methods” (2011:48–49). Finally, by opening up direct democracy toward becoming and by insisting that creative practice may rush ahead of theory, we can recognize the minor but important role that the ethnography of direct democracy can play in documenting, reflecting on, and contributing to a reimagined democracy.
