# Subject to labour: Racial Capitalism and ontology in the post-emancipation Caribbean
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
Racial capitalism is often understood as a process that acts upon subjects that are already racialized, facilitating their exploitative incorporation into capitalist processes. In this article, I push past that definition to argue that racial capitalism is a fundamentally ontologizing process by which subjectivity is produced. I advance this point through an analysis of the central role of labor in the foundation of post-emancipation Caribbean subject formation . I argue that in crossing the Atlantic in the service of colonial capital, enslaved Africans, and later indentured Indians, underwent a process that undid previous senses of identity, thus demanding new ontological moorings rooted in plantation labor. The practice and conditions of labor experienced by both groups after emancipation provided a common basis of ontological orientation. Thus, racial capitalism,’s through the instrument of labor, has fundamentally structured the terms and definitionter of Caribbean identity.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?


### How is the article organised?


### What are the key takeaways?

In this article, I think through Black and Indian labour during the post-emancipation period in the Caribbean to consider not only the durability of racial capitalism as colonial labour transformed in the wake of emancipation, but also how that labour, and thus racial capitalism, became an ontologizing process for these Caribbean subjects. Racial capitalism, as defined and used here, is the employment of racializing processes, such as racism, but also the categorizing function of race, through social differentiation, to uphold and facilitate capitalism broadly (1-2).

### Racial Capitalism and Caribbean Foundation (2-3)

By paying attention to racial capitalist dynamics within the scope of subject formation, this article seeks to understand post-emancipation Caribbean identity and belonging as rooted in labour practices and relations. The analysis reveals a transformation shared by both Caribbean subjects of black and Indian background made through the unique yet similar experiences of slavery and indentureship, respectively, and position these experiences as facilitating a Caribbean ontology.

- As slavery formed the basis of modernity that capitalism would create, it severely diminished cultural linkages between traditional African norms and Black Caribbean cultural practices.
- The Caribbean region was made up of lower and middle class, with the lower class planters identified as better workers.
- It was made up on the dynamics of a colonizer / colonized relation.
- As a Western imperial project in capitalism and globalization, the Caribbean was exceptional in its constitution of fragmented histories experiencing racial disjuncture.
- Post-emancipation Caribbean society was stratified by race and operated along a cultural continuum between the poles of the cultural practices, ethics and systems maintained by European colonizers and the amalgam of African ethnicities glossed as "Black".
- "The challenges in finding a singular theory that can account for the multiplicity of cultural heritage in the Caribbean can be read as the difficulty to accommodate incommensurate histories, epistemologies, and varied geographic attachments where not all members of a multi-cultural society relate in the same way to the pace they inhabit." (2-3)
- "The Creole came to represent all the values of a plantation society as creolization, the culture--creating processes of hybridisation, served as a vector of racial capitalist plantation ethics." (3)
- "Racial Capitalism as rooted in the plantocracy provides an ontological framework that maintains unification among multiple categories of identities." (3)

### Racial Capitalism and Black-Indian Labour Relations (3-4)

"[Indian] Indentureship demonstrated the historical agency of racial capitalism to continuously produce and reproduce forms of subjectivity." (3)

Indian indentureship ended up being just another form of slavery - these workers assumed the economic role of the slaves and their status as well. The privileges of democracy were illusionary. 

Plantation authorities imprisoned Indian labourers if caught and under this category the predicament of the indentured labourer was similar to Africans under slavery.

[[Robinson]] tells of the similarities of these servants and enslaved Africans. The rationale behind the British indenture scheme is that the Indian labour would discipline Black workers in regard to wages and labour hours, enabling British sugar producers to win back a competitive position against their competitors who still utilized slave labour in the production of sugar ... "social differentiation between Black and Indian labourers produced deep practices and sentiments of competition, ultimately facilitating the labour objectives of the British. Indeed, competition would affect race relations, leading to animosity between the two groups of labourers which bolstered the divisive nature of the categories of race." (3)

"The competitiveness in the labor regime was facilitated by competing values of ethnicity for both Indians and Blacks. For Black laborers, their history in the region, having been in the Caribbean for over two hundred years by that point, provided them a certain form and claim of belonging. For the Indians, their culture, which continued to be revered by the British despite Indians’ low-ranked place in the New World social hierarchy, engendered a particular comparative cultural supremacy ([[Khan]], 2004). This sentiment is believed to be politically and economically motivated as the reinforcement of mutually negative stereotypes, often disseminated by the plantation authority, increased competitiveness among the two groups (Khan, 2004)." (3).

These antagonisms while presented as two subordinate groups jockeying for power, again, much depended on “the substantial colonial legislation [which] was intended precisely to halt processes of cultural hybridization that were generating a cross-ethnic imagined community at the popular level.” (4)

### The Ontology of Labor

"Through an ontologizing of colonialism and the plantation complex, racial capitalist formations can reconcile the disjuncture of identities present in the Caribbean." (4).

"Taking up [[W, E. B. Du Bois]] ' racial capitalist framework, ontologization produced by racial capitalism is not merely about the work of laborers but is about how the functioning of labor constitutes a sense of being. This process is facilitated by labor becoming core to one’s being and their belonging within the world around them." (4)

```ad-quote
title: 4, summary
"For Indians who made that transition along the cross-atlantic voyage, much like enslaved Africans before them, crossing caused in many material ways a dropping of one’s past and becoming remade. Contextually applied to the Caribbean, with its diverse histories of migration, the suggestion that one’s identity can change in transit could enable a transformation in the regional conception of identity. With this perspective, the voyages across the Atlantic that have, up to now, been viewed as causing an ideological disjuncture with one’s identity, can instead serve as a portal in which upon transition, past identities are relinquished and made anew in the present. While both groups maintained their respective histories and cultures as best as they could, crossing for the purpose of labor initiated an ontological shift in the New World. The outcome of that crossing was the undoing of previous senses of identity, and what took its place became necessarily framed by their experience as laborers, where labor served as the foundational qualification of life under colonialism."
```

An approach to Caribbean identity requires a complex identity - formed on a basis that is culturally fragmented, ruptured and hybridized. Under such circumstances, poly-ontologies can be condensed.

"An ontological paradigm of labor (facilitated by migration) appears best suited to account for an inclusive Caribbean identity. This notion of ontology does not need to be sourced in an ancient cosmogonic origin, but can be determined, while not quite ex nihilo, from discourses and practices, by which ontologies are established not solely by the notion of being as a constant cosmology, but by activity based in the present." (5)

## Conclusion
 
```ad-tldr
title: Conclusion, 5
collapse: closed
The Caribbean experience has been “indelibly conditioned by colonial subjugation” (Munasinghe, 2001:212), but it is, in fact, this subjugation that the descendants of slaves and indentured laborers share. My aim in this paper has been to understand labor as an instrument of ontologization. 

As an instrument indiscriminate in its unyielding requirements that those under it meet the demands of profit, made for particular and new subjects. As labor makes possible an ontologization that produces the notion of the Caribbean as both subject and geography, the system for which labor is an inducement, namely racial capitalism, must be recognized for full capability of its “historical agency” that Robinson outlined as that processes’ means of social endurance. In other words, racial capitalism cannot be seen as merely a system or logic of capitalist production or accumulation, but critically, as a force that produces capital as well as subjectivity. 

Moreover, this subjectivity, when developed in the context of historical and cultural rupture, can become the basis for a comprehensive sense of self, or ontology. In some way, the the argument here has been an extension of Robinson’s original treatise, where the development of the “worker” would go on to build a particular European class formation that was functionally always racialized despite the myths that would attempt to deny this truth. 

However, thinking through the Caribbean, and within a context that extends beyond the Black laborer, whether as enslaved, or emancipated, there is opportunity to more clearly identity the full functioning of racial capitalism.
