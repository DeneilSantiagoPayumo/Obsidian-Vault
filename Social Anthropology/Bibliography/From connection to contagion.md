## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
This essay proposes that we ‘think data’ with a complex legacy of work, once disavowed and now resurgent in social theory, on crowd formations. I propose this move because social media platforms’ mobilization of data – the extractions, ever-shifting reaggregations, and micro-targeting, on the one hand, and our engagements, re-tweets, acts of sharing, and production of virality, on the other – has fuelled such anxious concern about the very things that animated much crowd theory in the first place. Key among these concerns are the force of emotional contagion and the threat of social dissolution; the composition of ‘the social’ by elements that well exceed the human; and pressing questions about the media through which energetic forces travel, often with lightning speed. What questions might be enabled by attending to the resonance between crowd theory's ‘anti-liberal’ preoccupations and contemporary concerns over how social media platforms crowd us?

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Thinking data: crowds and clouds.

How was the cloud (as data aggregation, social media platforms, and algorithmic filtering, among other things) generating new kinds of collectives or aggregate formations.

What do we mean by each part of the question? First, the cloud - what is it? The author uses the cloud to refer to social media platforms as engines for data production, data gathering and data aggregation. These practices re-compose their units into infinitely expanding, partible collectives/

What is 'crowded' or crowding about these aggregating effects?

The rise of authoritarian and anti-democratic regimes return us to the close relationship of the cloud. For [[Gustave Le Bon]], crowds threatened to dissolve society itself.

"I am asking how the cloud crowds us (again) at a moment in which that question has taken an explicitly anxious, arguably 'anti-liberal' turn. For it seems increasingly difficult to disentangle various insurgent illiberalism, from conspiracy theorists to racist violence, from the data that transits through and constitutes social media." (97)

We can turn to Facebook's transformation from a self-branded engine of 'connection' to accused vector of 'contagion'.

The World Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public health bodies have indeed issued warnings about an ‘infodemic’ fuelled by the major social media platforms – an overabundance of information, much of it false, racist, and dangerous, which, along with the other virus, must be contained.[1](https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13482#jrai13482-note-0001_32 "Link to note") Infodemic and Cambridge Analytica, QAnon and ‘memetic warfare’ (Philips [2018](https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13482#jrai13482-bib-0034)), and white nationalist marches have arguably supplanted Facebook and Twitter ‘Revolutions’ as iconic instances of the cloud and its crowds.

### Contagion, heterogeneity, medium

What is transiting through our preoccupations with social media as data extraction and aggregation right now? There's three points of contact:

1. Emotional contagion - [[Gustave Le Bon]].
	 "What most drew Le Bon's attention was the force that held a crowd together, and here he and his fellow travellers become much more interesting. Not just any mass of people constituted a crowd: a group became a crowd only when ‘emotional contagion’ took hold of its members – a mutual susceptibility to ideas, images, emotions, or actions that, in a crowd, spread like fire from one person to the next, outpacing and indeed swamping reasoned thought or deliberation. In a crowd, Le Bon fretted and Elias Canetti later marvelled, we lose ourselves." - 98

Suggestion, imitation and contagion meant a loss of rationality and capacity for discernment and a dissolution of the individual as an autonomous, bounded, stable and sovereign subject.

2.  The heterogeneity of the crowd
	"Le Bon noted repeatedly that a crowd is something distinctive and even new; the force of emotional contagion results in a recombination and hence an essential transformation of its constitutive elements. A crowd is, in this idiom, something different to, and far more than, a ‘summing up-of or an average struck between its elements’ (Le Bon [2009](https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13482#jrai13482-bib-0023) [1895]: 16). More broadly, indeed, crowd theory produces a notion of crowds that are constitutively not-simply-human; there is, in much of this work, something peculiar, arguably ‘more-than’, about their nature. For Tarde, humans are not the only monads in the world, or even in the universe, through which the forces of imitation, vibration, and irritation bring about resemblances, nor is imitation a ‘psychological’ principle transiting between individual people and their individual minds (Tarde [2012](https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13482#jrai13482-bib-0041) [1893]). Actions imitate actions, gestures imitate gestures, and ideas imitate ideas (Latour [2005](https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13482#jrai13482-bib-0021); Tarde [2012](https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13482#jrai13482-bib-0041) [1893])." (99)

3. I would suggest that many crowd theorists indeed already understood crowds as *media* through which transmit palpability and urgency ... the infinitesimal acts of imitation that generate both crowds and sociality more broadly.

### Social media as crowd media

"Through algorithmically filtered feeds of similarity, likes, and likeness, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms seem to have become highly effective suggestionizing (Le Bon's term) machines. These machines, moreover, are constitutively heterogeneous, feeding quite explicitly on that which ‘looks like a human’: bots, markets in Twitter followers, click farms, ‘fake’ accounts that might be automated or might be human-made. The notably efficient transit of affect and ‘irrationality’ (‘fake news,’ extreme sentiment) through these networks _is_ the problem named by Le Bon's concerns with emotional contagion. And ‘emotional contagion’, in turn, is a key principle on which social media platforms’ revenue models are based (Kramer, Guillory & Hancock)." (100)

How do we think of these relations without reproducing a panicky breathlessness?

1. Crowds are made by suggestion, not scale (101)
	Social media makes worlds small and inducing, we fear and accuse. "What crowds us even in such moments of presumed atomization is our embeddedness in algorithmic universes of suggestions and likeness." - Cambridge Analytica where "the company used quizzes and surveys to gain access to the profiles of Facebook users and those whom they had friended. This extracted data was then mobilized in the form of ‘psychographic’ profiles of voters that were used, in turn, to micro-target electoral information at particular voters. Here we see the entanglement of social media's data practices: covert data extraction that is, in turn, enabled by the networks and relations of affinity produced through users’ own engagements – sharing, Friendships, likeness – with the platform (see Cadwalladr & Graham-Harrison 2018)"

2. Does social media crowd insofar as it incites violence, extremism and lies? (101-102)
	"Is social media merely a monetized effect of, even a parasite on, extant forms of collective effervescence, or is it the source of palpable energies itself, a mode of configuring atmospheres and affective/informational environments?" - see 2018 article, A genocide incited on Facebook'

	"I cannot help but think of Le Bon's anxious ... Understanding that if if crowds are particularly 'receptive' to extreme sentiment, they are also the transformative medium through which such sentiment both travels and is animated." (102)

3. What connects is contagion
	"Facebook is a platform that 'connects' precisely by instrumentalizing and monetizing emotional contagion itself ... academic psychologists collaborating with Facebook's own research team had used the social network as a ready-made experimental platform for studying ..."

"The dynamic relation between contagious, destructive urgency and a business model that feeds on and hence amplifies exactly such urgency is, we might say, one of the most important sites of palpable intesification and more-than-social, crowded composition at work here. It has has certainly provoked a series of concerns about the way Facebook in particular, though not alone, makes us into ‘dopamine’-fuelled, emotionally driven users, ever more vulnerable to each other and to the redounding forces of irrationality, hatred, and contagious fakery (to paraphrase just a few of countless such laments). Le Bon argued that crowds, galvanized through the power of contagion and governed by extreme sentiment rather than measured reason, threatened to bring civilized society (i.e. aristocratic society) to its knees ([2009](https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.13482#jrai13482-bib-0023) [1895]: 8). Critics of Facebook, including a chorus of former Facebook employees, have started talking about the way that social media (or just ‘social’) might well be destroying society itself, and with it, the substrate of rationality on which political equality (the opposite, of course, of what Le Bon desired) is based.
