# Knowledge, Skill and the Inculcation of the Anthropologist: Learning to Sew in the Field.

## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
This article explores employment as a mode of participant observation, by analyzing the complex relationship between skill acquisition, embodiment, and anthropological analysis. It highlights the importance of thinking critically about the body, including the ethnographer’s own body in the field. I describe working in a garment factory and learning to sew as part of my doctoral research on the garment industry in Trinidad, West Indies. I argue that disciplining the body into a particular craft is also a process of incorporating (or ‘‘taking into the body’’) the ideologies of work that structure skill’s meaning and practice. By describing my own difficulties ‘‘disembodying’’ what I learned in the field (in order to intellectualize the experience) I show how learning practical skills and enacting them everyday can be both a vigorous and perilous form of ethnographic research.

### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

Drawing on the experience of learning to sew during ethnographic research in Trinidad, West Indies ... Learning skills alongside our informants, and practicing these skills in their midst, the principal danger is of internalizing local points of view too much, rather than two little.

Disciplining the body into a particular craft is shown to be a process of incorporating ... the ideologies of *work* that structure skill's meaning and practice. "When I learned how to se in Trinidad, I was not only taught an aesthetic orientation toward clothing and techniques of the body to draft, cut, and stitch garments; I was also schooled in a particular perception of sewing as an income-generating activity. When I returned home from the field, I struggled to divest myself of such views to look at relationship between skill acquisition and work practices more critically." (55)

### The Seamstress' Habitus I: Worker Strategies of Skill Acquisition

56

Sewing has two main components: drafting patterns and cutting them into cloth and assembling the pieces together. When a child is sent to local seamstress to learn "sewing", what is being sought are skills in both and stitching.

An extremely important way of gaining sewing skills is what Venessa Maher, writing about Italian seamstresses, has called "stealing with the eye".

Signature Fashions workers often used formal employment in the factory to aid in their home business pursuits. Creative inspiration and knowledge of fashionable designs hold economic importance for the independent seamstress; the Signature Fashions factory was seen a good place to work because it provided stitchers with expertise and access to designer garments.

Patterns were pilfered from the shop floor to be reworked into new styles at home.

### The Seamstress' Habitus II: The Anthropologist's Experience

57

The anthropologist was assigned a job: the button tacker.

Over the course of my "employment" I grew particular intrigued by the shop-floor conversations from which I was excluded.

Although Signature Fashions was considered a good place to work (air-conditioned, minimum wage, access to fashion, the company was not the centre of its employees' professional identities. They would not use the word 'garment worker' to call themselves, the skilled workers are likely to describe themselves as 'into the sewing.'

The anthropologist deemed that by learning how to cut and stitch, they could claim the alluring domain of activity - pride and pleasure of cutting fabrics.

My experience learning to sew with Donny, and interviews with teachers and learners in Trinidad, reveals an emphasis on nonlinguistic, practice-oriented approaches to sewing, with the teacher demonstrating tasks that the learner is required to perform as the teacher watches. Although the learner must rehearse her teacher’s ‘‘way’’ of cutting, teachers recognize that each learner will come to ‘‘have her own style’’ of cutting, and that she must ‘‘take her time’’ to discover and develop her ‘‘own way.’’ Thus if learning a craft also means learning ‘‘culture,’’ as Marcel Mauss has argued (Mauss 1973), when acquiring the ability to sew Trinidadians also learn to see ‘‘skill’’ not merely as technical, mechanistic ability, but rather as a deeply personal expression of the embodied self, whereby personal flair reveals both innate ability and a cultivated ‘‘style’’ (cf. Carnegie 1987).

Cutting however - you stitch on a machine. Little practice.

Workers approved of the home-made clothing, and supported her. She was not acknowledged as someone "into the sewing" and enjoyed the pleasures of membership.

### Agency, Intentionality, and Effects

58

The anthropologist believed that garment workers as active agents - cut and contrive - a living through creative participation in formal and informal sectors of the economy.

Conceptualization of garment workers as "agents" was salient - using factory as a resource containing materials, machines, technical how-how, and fashion ideas. Within unequal conditions, workers depicted their various acts of "thiefing a chance" as a bold decision to make the most out of options.

However, why did the garment factory owners allow wide-spread illicit practices like thiefing a chance to flourish?

"[[Burawoy]] describes workers attempting to gain control over work-tasks through a range of shop-floor games collectively dubbed "making out." Making out relies on complex interactions among workers - including cooperation and the enforcement of shared norms - which often incorporate the tacit support of shop-floor supervisors. For Burawoy, what is most significant about these games is that workers playing them not only participate in their employer’s appropriation of the surplus value of their labour; they also participate in the obscuring of this surplus value extraction. By ‘‘making out’’ on the shop floor, workers gain an illusory sense of mastery and autonomy over their work, while at the same time consenting to their own exploitation. It is this element of consent (which obviates coercion) that gives such casual ‘‘games’’ a pernicious effect." (58)

Signature Fashions workers consistently conformed to managerial demands that they adapt to the "flexible" conditions of the postliberalization economy (Harvey 1989, Martin 1994). Thiefing a chance is a structuring feature of shop-floor life at Signature Fashions. It drew on, and contributed to, the ‘‘flexible’’ orientation of the factory by encouraging workers to skill up for new tasks, and reinforcing networks of mutual aid that were essential to the formal production process (Prentice 2008). As flexible workers in an instable and hostile economic environment, signature Fashions employees come to embody new subjectivities associated with the neoliberal insistence on self-reliance, resourcefulness, and opportunism (Freeman 2005; Ferguson 2006), which are also deeply inflected by West Indian cultural mores that celebrate cunning, creativity, and nerve (Browne 2004). Signature Fashions had, in part, survived the vagaries of postliberalization because of the types of ‘‘agents’’ its employees had become.

"I came to see that the notion of "agency" must always be assessed in relation to intentionality and effects.  In my doctoral thesis, I argued that the decline of trade unions and the withdrawal of the state from worker’s welfare (both facets of neoliberalism as much as the opening of trade barriers) forced garment workers to become exemplary. Neoliberal subjects. Not only do they have no one to rely on but their individual selves in everything ranging from pay disputes to occupational injury, garment workers have also mobilized local values of self-reliance, individualism, autonomy, and the valorization of cheeky ‘‘cunning’’ to get by in difficult economic times. In Trinidad, this ethos of individualism inflects within a historically racialized environment, in which managerial strategies of control rely upon, and thereby reinstantiate, ethnic difference (Yelvington 1995); forms of neoliberalism are thus shown to be critically local – beholden to particular legacies of economic history, politics, and social organization in any one place."

Trinidadian discourses of skills in the garment factory actually work in the service of capital to workers' disadvantage. Because skills in sewing constitute the basic condition of participation in the labour force, workers see capturing these skills as an important, individual ambition. "Although workers thief a chance behind the boss's back to prepare themselves for the work of the factory, such acts actually serve management's goals, by externalizing the costs of retraining workers, and avoiding more collective types of action (Prentice 2008). Recognizing the complexities of intentions and effects in the construction of capitalist labour relations prompts us to examine as well the role of desire (here, the desire for consumption) in shaping worker's response to unequal terms of employment."
