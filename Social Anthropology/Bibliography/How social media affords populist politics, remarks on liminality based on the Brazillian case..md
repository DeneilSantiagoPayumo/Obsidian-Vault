## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
In the past decade or so, populism and social media have been outstanding issues both in academia and the public sphere. At this point, evidence from multiple countries suggest that perceived parallels between the dynamics of social media and the mechanics of populist discourse may be more than just incidental, relating to a shared structural field. This article suggests one possible path towards making sense of how the dynamics of social media and the mechanics of populist mobilization have co-produced each other in the last decade or so. Navigating the interface between anthropology and linguistics, it takes key aspects of Victor Turner’s notion of liminality to suggest some of the ways in which social media’s anti-structural affordances may help lay a foundation for the contemporary flourishing of populist discourse: markers of social structure are suspended; communitas is formed; the
culture core is addressed; mimesis and anti-structural inversions are performed; subjects become influenceable. I elaborate on this claim based on Brazilian materials, drawn from online ethnography on pro-Bolsonaro WhatsApp groups and other platforms such as
Twitter and Facebook since 2018.

Keywords: populism, social media, post-truth, liminarity.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### POPULISM AND SOCIAL MEDIA, IN BRAZIL AND ELSEWHERE

Populist leaders like [[Bolsonaro]] and his predecessor, India's Prime MInister Narenda [[Modi]] have used social media for populist mobilization. "They did so by actively delegitimizing the professional press and attacking "elite media figures, alleging corruption" (407)

```ad-quote

In Brazil, both during and after the 2018 elections, criticism of Bolsonaro’s actions and statements has been explained away in terms of verba (funds): the desperate cry of parasites unwilling to let go of privileges and taxpayer money ‘freely’ granted to them by the State. Although fundamentally reliant on social media, both Modi and Bolsonaro have selectively engaged with allied mainstream media outlets. In the Brazilian case, a TV channel owned by one of the country’s largest evangelical churches, TV Record, has been a faithful government supporter.
```

This discourse splits the social field into two distinct, friend-enemy camps that feed off each other through escalating opposition. They decry expert language as boring and distant from the realities of common folks.

"Both appeal widely to vague notions of "law and order" and vigilante-style justice, while decrying human rights and belittling the due legal process." (408)

```ad-quote
title: 408
The two leaders are, moreover, fixated on rewriting history from the point of view of their respective ‘revolutions’. Both offer an “alternative narrative of nationalism and postcoloniality” which turn previously hegemonic histories inside out. While Modi’s focus is on the anti-Muslim Hindutva, Bolsonaro’s effort has been to redeem painful periods of Brazilian history, such as the 19th century monarchy (marked by slavery and the crushing of regional insurrections) and especially the Military Regime (1964-1984). They have done so based on “unsubstantiated allegations” which eventually become “self-evident facts” upon being widely circulated online.

### Crisis and Liminality

[[Victor Turner]] developed his theory of liminality as an explanation for the performative efficacy of tribal rituals. He notes three stages: separation, an intermediary stage he called limen and reaggregation.

Populist rupture occurs in context of widespread dissatisfaction, usually with a leader 'outside the system.' The 2013 protest in Brazil, the author argued, led the path to a liminal period in the country's political field. Bolsonaro was known back then as someone against political correctness and human rights' supposed protection of crooks and criminals.

The elections thus took place in a context of high dissatisfaction and widespread sentiment of chronic crisis.

### How social media affords liminality

#### 3.1 Markers of social structure are suspended

```ad-quote
title: 413
WhatsApp or Facebook groups, or filter-bubbles on Twitter and elsewhere, are in this sense functionally analogous to the bush huts built for Ndembo initiands, where they were kept isolated from regular village life until the liminal stage was completed and they were ready for reintegration into society at large.

A difference here is that, in digital populism, reintegration is not in sight. Much to the contrary, the whole apparatus is put in place in order to keep users sealed off from the broader public sphere – or to purposely fragment the latter into a camp of truth and authenticity opposed to a threatening outside made up of lies, hypocrisy, and conspiracies. Gatekeeping here is active, and may range from human (individual or collective) curators such as influencers and groups admins, to non-human conscripts like bots, platform algorithms, or, on WhatsApp, peer-to-peer cryptography. Whatever proposal to control or regulate online misinformation is denounced as censorship and encroaching on the freedom of speech.

In this sense, the Bolsonarist digital sphere approximates Kelty’s notion of recursive publics, thatis, a group constituted online by means of a reflexive “concern for the technical and legal conditions of possibility for their own association” (KELTY, 2005, p. 185).
```

#### 3.2 Communitas is formed

Liminality is based on an anti-structural social form he called *communitas*: "society as an unstructured or rudimentarily structured and relatively undifferentiated comitatus, community or even communion of equal individuals" (p. 360). 

```ad-quote
title: 414
In the context of digital populism, communitas ties operate analogously to Laclau’s chain of equivalence, which brings and binds individuals together by selecting out particularities in favor of shared, vague signifiers incorporated in the person of the leader and the body politic. In populism at large, the chain is extended by means of empty signifiers indexing some kind of “generalized social bond”, often involving vague notions of nationhood.
```

Triggers - Attention, Beware, Urgent contribute to extending the chain of equivalence and communitas - "On platforms such as Twitter, this connective function was, and still is, largely performed by hashtags figuring empty signifiers which are regularly created and spread by influencers, bots and common users to address every emerging issue or controversy around the government." (415).

Social media can be seen as a core for populism as now Bolsonaro's supporters can access him directly. "Please share until it reaches the president" was a common trigger. It is also regarded as an effect of the digital format itself.

"At the time, memes circulated widely showing reproductions of the T-shirt Bolsonaro was wearing during the stabbing: the point where the knife pierced his stomach soaked in deep red blood (the color of the enemy), precisely next to (and in sharp contrast with) the yellow-and-green word Brazil. The T-shirt read: “Brazil is my party”" (416).

#### 3.3 The culture core is addressed

Communitas is about “giving recognition to an essential and generic human bond, without which there could be no society”. Symbols address ontologies - the culture core (historical unity, common origin, etc.)

Nationalist signifiers - anthem, soccer shirt, coat of arms, Brazilian flag help mobilize elementary notions of order whereas their left-leaned opponents prefer red flags or flowers. This allows for easy identification of political camps. (416-417).

```ad-quote
title: 417
"As was suggested above, patriotism is at the core of Bolsonaro supporters’ common identity. It is not about representation, but rather experienced as direct, unmediated expression of the nation’s culture core: popular sovereignty. Widespread mottos encapsulate the notion that such belonging refers to a more fundamental domain, beyond (or before) regular political structure: from the official campaign slogan ‘Brazil above everything; God above everyone’ to catchphrases like ‘The left does activism. The right does patriotism."  (417)
```

It is fragility and empowerment combined into one. That is the core of liminality. Many Bolsonaro followers act online as though they are indeed on a marvel movie or even a battle for the future of Brazil.

This is about full fledged authenticity - "By rendering the mediations that perform such identities and attitudes invisible ... social media afford the expectation of direct and full equivalence between voters, leader, and the source of all power: the people, the nation, God itself." (417).

#### 3.4 Mimesis and anti-structural inversions are performed.

Then, a radical inversion. 

Trump's election may be able to be seen as a call for restituting order by means of radical inversion. A taboo element is elevated to a holy being, one capable of purifying a corrupt system and reconstituting its integrity.

```ad-quote
title: 419
The left circulated it [Pastor Silas Malfaia telling Bolsonaro that he is chosen because he is lowly] as a hilarious video, but in fact Malafaia’s is a language to which many Brazilians can relate, for they are indeed the despised, the weak, the lowly things of this world. Whenever Bolsonaro was accused of being ill-qualified to the position of president, he would not deny the accusations, but capitalize on them by retorting that “God does not choose the qualified; He qualifies the chosen”. That powerful statement reads like a fully-fledged theological version of the radical populist inversion described by Laclau (2005), when structure is not just suspended, but fully turned inside out.
```

Bolsonaro's populist style - trolling enemies, gestural enactments, comedic entertainment. Truths are produced and diffused through mimetic citationality.  The leader's language is meant to be mimicked and replicated - contain pointers. They show his followers how to speak like Trump. As a result, it's harder to differentiate individual from collective, automated from non-human language. (420-421).

#### 3.5 Subjects become influenceable

In communitas, individuals are stripped of structural markers and turned equal in order "to submit to an authority that is nothing less than that of the total community" (1969, p. 364) (421).

This is a total surrender. Individuals must be passive and humble. Status change is carried out under the guidance of an official to which individuals must fully submit and trust. (ibid).

```ad-quote
title: 421
As Marres put it, social media is a “truthless public sphere by design” that works precisely by “doing without interpretation”. Its design is guided by principles inspired less in the social sciences than in the dynamics of “viral contagion or the flocking of birds”, which are predicated on “the ‘manipulability’ of users” (435) in order to work. Users’ identities and desires are recursively shaped by algorithmic mediations which associate them with others through homophilic networking, thus further promoting echo chambers and confirmation bias.
