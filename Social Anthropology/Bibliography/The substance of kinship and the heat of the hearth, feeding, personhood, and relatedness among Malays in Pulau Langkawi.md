[[Kinship]]
[[Jane Carsten]] - expands on notion of biology (1995)
**This considers the [[Malay]] people.**

For the Malays on the island of Langkawi, feeding is a vital component in the long process of becoming a person and participating fully in social relation. The process begins with conception and birth; it continues through feeding and growing and living together in the house - it involves marriage and the birth of new children and it is only in a limited sense completed when adult men and women become grandparents.

Argument placed in context of an analysis of kinship - cannot be assumed a priori. The term 'relatedness' indicates indigenous ways of acting out and conceptualizing relations between people as distinct from notions derived from anthropological theory. We use a processual view of personhood and kinship. It is through living that people become persons - the core substance of kinship in local perceptions is blood and contribution is food.

In Langkawi birth begins the process of becoming a person that continues with feeding and living together. Food creates both persons in a physical sense and the substance blood by which they are related.

Both indigenous western ideas and the analysis of kinship assume that social aspects of a relationship can be separated from, or added to, a biological substratum.

Schneider shows that not all societies have something have something kinship in these terms. In these ideas (the author presents) kinship is not derived from procreation. ON the basis of relatedness, a more flexible kinship - we examine how people in Langkawi define and construct their notions of relatedness, and what values and meanings they give those notions.

We separate the social from the biological.

Conclusion - suggest how Malay understandings not only challenge traditional anthropological definitions of kinship but how they offer the possibility of redefining kinship in a flexible way. Boundaries between people and what they consume may be less clear.

We focus on substance and the way it is acquired through feeding.

## houses, hearths, women, and sibling (225)

Houses constitute a central feature of social organization.

The most important principle embodied is that of unity and resistance to division - unity is reflected in the spatial arrangements of the house. Particularly, houses never have more than one hearth.

Houses in Langkawi are associated with women - women spend most of their time there while men spend their time fishing. Women are positively associated with the focal space of the house - it is in the dapur that women perform the activities that are central to the reproduction of the house. 

A house without a woman living in it is not a proper house because it does not have a 'mother of a house', must hold the central post. The post is the house spirit.

Houses are associated with children - siblingship is the most elaborated relation in Malay kinship. Siblings are expected to render aid to each other and to remain close. Older brothers have affectionate relations with younger sisters and it has a structural significance in the relation between husband and wife. The modelling of marriage on kinship (older brother and younger sister) means that affinity has a special status as it in the process of being transformed consanguinity.

Siblings are conceived as more or less indivisible set - principle expressed in naming systems for siblings.

Associations - each child belong to a set of 'birth siblings', the child and the placenta are conceptualized as 'two siblings'. When a child is born, it is buried in a woven basket on the grounds. The sibling set in this ritual is anchored to the house.

Sibling asserts itself in the womb before birth continues to influence a person's fortunes throughout life - uterus is the sibling's first house and the placenta their first commensal relation. Co-eating begins before birth: homes occupied after birth create a weaker form of siblingship than that created in the womb.

Notions of the person reflect the fundamental importance of siblingship - each person has a life spirit. The most important semangat (life spirit) is of people, rice, houses and boats.

The person is thus individual and multiple - each body is the container of a sibling set, the semangat of a person is part of a seven member set. Persons and their bodies have a multiple identitiy.

Houses, hearths, feeding, women and sibling sets are bound with one another.

## feeding and shared substance 227

Feeding is said to begin in the womb. In the first house the child is nourished by blood, after birth the milk fed to a baby is believed to derive from the mother's blood. The mother's milk is important to a child's physical and emotional development and to the child's connection with its mother.

Milk feeding defines the category of incestuous relations - kin who drunk milk from the breast of the same woman may not marry.

The salience of a prohibition on marriage between milk siblings is rendered greater by the fact that many children spend a large part of their childhood in houses other than their material ones. The frequency of formal and informal fostering arrangements increases the possibility that gives this definition of incest its particular fascination and horror.

The substance that kin share is said to be derived from their shared consumption of milk as babies - milk feeding makes reference to blood since human milk is produced from blood circulating in the body. The blood shared through consumption of milk is only that of the mother or woman. Shared blood is shared female substance - never paternal blood.

Eating rice and eating a meal are synonymous in Malay perception. Food is rice - the defining component of a proper meal. The day-to-day sharing of rice meals cooked in the same hearth implies shared substance.

We find a parallel in the realm of substance and feeding - mothers and their offspring and siblings are related, having blood in common. If the blood requires changing (someone needs a blood transfusion) they must be given the blood of nonrelatives rather than the blood of a sibling.

If milk and blood are the prime sources of shared substance, it follows transfusions of blood might be problematic in terms of incest. When the author asked ... donated blood does nto carry the potentiality of incest because it is not eaten.

It is important to emphasize the way that this axis of relatedness operates through women. Blood, milk and rice meals derive from women, and all denote commonality and similarity. Blood, milk and food are a source of physical strength. The emotional tie children have with their mother is strong as mothers are the source of shared substance.

Shared substance gives emotion and words a special effectiveness - if a baby is given away it should be given its mothers milk.  The mother's milk is a source of shared substance and of strong emotional bond, enabling the child to recognize its mother.

Women and hearths can produce kinship - when children are fostered they are said to take on the character traits and physical attributes of those who raise them. They come to resemble them. These speculations at the margins of normal occurrence show very clearly that notions of shared substance to which blood and milk are central are also very much bound up with ideas about shared consumption, feeding, and the house hearth.

Substance is conceptualized in terms of food cooked in the dapur means that food and the heat of the house have a particular importance.

### Conception, birth and feeding 229

According to Malays in Langkawi children are created from their seed of their father and the blood of their mother. The father's seed comes from the fluid in the backbone. The seed spends 40 days inside the body of the father, where it mixes with the menstrual blood, mixing with the blood of the mother and being nourished.

This is associated with heat and blood - marriage involves a process of heating that is counteracted by ritual means. The absorption of heating food leads to a surplus of sexual energy. After women are old, they have no blood and cannot conceive.

...

Skipped this.

Marriage, circumcision and childbirth are symbolically and ritually associated - assured through feeding and the heat of the dapur that equilibrates the heat of the body through the provision of food.

The symptons of meroyan sickness and its causes can be seen as speculation on bodily boundaries. After childbirth when the body's boundaries have opened to produce another body, normal health in the mother is restored through reassertion of these boundaries.

## hearths, feeding and substance: the process of becoming related 234

The house in Langkawi is a female structure but it also contains the notion of siblingship.

A discourse of notions of substance: kin share blood but the degree varies. The affective ties between a mother and her children are strong. Blood is not a substance in which one is born, it is produced and transformed from the food that is eaten.

Milk has particular significance in these ideas about substance and relatedness since it is both a bodily substance and food to be consumed - the enabling substance of kinship.

Living and eating together is one way of sharing substance. Feeding is one way people can begin their incorporation into a village community.

The notion of boundary: blood, milk and rice are similar and convertible into each other. These ideas are echoed in the notion of the person - each individual is part of a sibling set and these ties are conceived as being more or less unbreakable. The boundness and permeability of the bodies are problematic.

## Conclusion: toward a redefinition of kinship

Schneider challenges the idea that procreation is everywhere accorded the same value. Schneider is correct to challenge this: this definition is bound up in Western notions..

Schneider speaks of culture as superimposed upon prior biological facts.

The relationship between physical and social kinship is central to the way kinship has been defined - biological and social ties have been distinguished from each other that kinship can be defined in terms of biology.

The author suggests that since both the definition and meaning of kinship are culturally variable, we cannot apply a universal definition - he rejects a cross-cultural definition of kinship in procreation.

The central question should be: how do the people we study define their notions of relatedness and what values do they give them?

Malay fascination with boundaries lead us to question the way in which we use dichotomies such as the biological and social.
