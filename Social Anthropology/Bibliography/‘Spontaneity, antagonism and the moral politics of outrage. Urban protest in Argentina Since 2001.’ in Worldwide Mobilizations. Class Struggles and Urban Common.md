# SPONTANEITY, ANTAGONISM AND THE MORAL POLITICS OF OUTRAGE

## Article Introduction

### What are the key takeaways?

- Distinction between outraged 'spontaneous' protests and ones made by trade unions, or neighbourhood-based associations.
- Moral politics complementary to the moral politics of government (ethnographies)
- Friend/enemy distinction constitutive of the political
- History of key mass mobilizations in Buenos Aires then types of mobilization then moralities of outrage then mobilization on social and economic projects then assessments of moralization.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### 'Middle-Class' Protests

- Most mass mobilizations in Argentina are described as 'middle class', 'national' and 'spontaneous'.
- This is highly contested (reading of motivation, cues, techniques...)

- 8N made a claim to the Argentine 'people'
- To be labelled 'middle class' delegitimates the protest - it was consisted of people who were rather wealthier and whiter than earlier protestors. 
- Thought of themselves as workers.

In both cases what was important was to signal the crowd as national, whether ‘gente’ or ‘pueblo’. In November 2012, that was signalled by the prevalence of the national flag among the demonstrators. Most of them carried flags and empty pots and pans in preference to placards; and there were certainly no overt signifiers of belonging to particular political parties. Many of the protesters knew to wear white t-shirts or shirts, and if they had forgotten to bring along an Argentine flag, they could buy one on the streets surrounding the mobilization. They sang the national anthem and occupied key national spaces for mobilization in the city, namely the Obelisk and the Plaza de Mayo. 7 White tops and national flags have become relatively common in these ‘middle-class’ demonstrations, and featured also in the March 2009 insecurity march and the demonstrations condemning the murder of Alberto Nisman in January and February 2015.

### Spontaneity

- By 8N spontaneity became a contested term (connections between organizers, media group!)

```ad-quote

By painting the protests as not quite spontaneous, this very pro-government newspaper had further reduced their power in the eyes of my Kirchnerista interlocutors; just as much as their own readings of the protesters as middle class did. Spontaneity was a very important criterion for them when reading the cacerolazos, in large part because of the importance of spontaneity in narratives of the famous mobilizations that the 2012 cacerolazos had been attempting to cite or recreate. This was especially true for the protests of 2001–2, as I described above.

To provide a counterpoint to the narrative of authentic spontaneity in the November 2012 cacerolazo, government supporters in Argentina turned to discussions of media conspiracy. Most of my UPCN informants blamed the media for at the very least stoking up opposition to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner because of her attempts to implement the media law of 2009. This law included provisions that reduce the market share that can be owned by a single media company, and they particularly affected the Grupo Clarín, whose flagship newspaper had moved into increasingly fierce opposition to Cristina since her 2008 confrontation with agribusiness (or the rural oligarchy, or farmers, depending on your point of view) over taxation of agricultural exports. 9 The Grupo Clarín ‘controls 60% of the cable market, 25% of the internet market, Argentina’s second most popular TV channel, three provincial channels, and 10 radio stations, as well as six other papers, a news agency and a printing works’, according to The Guardian newspaper (Watts 2012). The legislation capped corporate ownership of the broadcast market at 35 per cent, and, crucially, applied to cable, meaning that Clarín’s broadcasting licences would be cut from 158 to 24, by means of a forced sale. Clarín opposed this legislation both through the courts and through its media outlets. It also strongly supported the cacerolazos, and its main open-air TV channel, El Trece, famously hosted the Sunday evening programme ‘Periodismo Para Todos’, anchored by Jorge Lanata. This programme began airing in April 2012, and subsequently enjoyed steadily growing audiences, all the while attacking the president, her government, her late husband and her supporters in investigative reports and satirical sketches, accusing them all of corruption and incompetence. The TV programme became so popular that the rival state-owned TV channel scheduled soccer matches for the same time slot.

Spontaneity is linked to tropes of morality of indignation or outrage. Indignation is associated with the young - precariously employed graduates who have an affinity with social-media etc. Indignation is linked to several politicians.

Cristina attacked: appearance, influenced by her husband, made up of 'matrimonio K', making money due to real estate, associated her with dictatorial elements: concentrating too much power, failed to consult broadly over policy measures, critiques filtered through gender.

Back in November 2012, my pro-K informants scoffed at demonstrators’ placards that denounced a Kirchnerista dictatorship. Just over a year previously, they pointed out, Cristina had won the election with 54 per cent of the vote; and they insisted that people were in fact perfectly at liberty to say what they wanted about the regime. Indeed, they thought that part of the problem that had given rise to the November cacerolazo was ineffective opposition in conventional political spaces. They denounced the chaos of leaderless protest and the lack of organization, but at the same time they sought out any evidence they could find that there was an organizational structure behind the cacerolazos and that it was linked either to oppositional political parties or to specific media corporations. After all, somebody was producing the posters that called protesters to the obelisk on 8 November; somebody had set up the first website, Facebook page and Twitter account, surely. Nobody really knew what was going on or what people wanted when they took to the street, other than to express their outrage at the president.

### Insecurity

Government supporters found hard to dismiss the problem of insecurity - the rise of violent crime, fear of becoming a victim, interpersonal violence and fear of crime.

```ad-quote
title: 105 then 106
Protesters denounce two sets of actors: first, the perpetrators of violent crime, and second the (implicitly corrupt) police forces that fail to bring them to justice, or who engage in violent and repressive policing themselves. However, the dominant emotion is a sense of outrage at the fact of living in a situation of insecurity, of fear of violent crime.

The common element was of course opposition to the government, but it might be granting official opposition figures too much agency to suggest that they were able to organize or even channel outrage against insecurity into street protests. They could just as easily have been jumping on the bandwagon in an attempt to co-opt that outrage for their own political project. It would be impossible to know which is true. For now, I want instead to highlight three linked points: 1) these mass mobilizations are open to multiple contested readings (pro-dictatorship or anti? Anti-corruption or anti-K? Anti-police or anti-criminal?), but 2) those readings depend to a large extent on just how spontaneous a demonstration is perceived to be. Finally, they express a moral politics of outrage and indignation, one increasingly characteristic of contemporary politics in Argentina and elsewhere.

### Protest Moralities of Denunciation and Demand-Making

Organized workers produce moral politics - placards are full of statements of moral and material.

Distinction between mobilization and moral politics.

They even differ physically, as organized demonstrations tendto take the form of a march that flows through from one agreed meeting point on the Avenue 9 de Julio (usually) towards a rally at the Plaza de Mayo or Plaza del Congreso, with groups who have been convened usually by SMS, and identify themselves by banners and flags; while the ‘middle-class’ mobilizations are more amorphous massings at key sites, which people join individually and in groups, prompted by a call on social media that is then publicized in the mainstream media. In November 2012, organizers (if there were any) deliberately did not schedule a rally or speeches; at some point the crowd decided to make its way to the Plaza de Mayo, but it was pretty aimless once people had heeded the call on social media and convened at the obelisk, raising the question of the need for some form of ‘post-spontaneous’ organization (Dalakoglou 2012).

Another difference is the emphasis on spontaneity versus leader-
ship, each aspect being morally valued according to one’s political positioning. Finally, the organized demonstrations make considerable effort to formulate specific demands, while the others express a much more diffuse and inchoate set of sentiments, which range from dissatisfaction with the state of the country to anger and disgust at the president.

Class position?

Three themes: economic policy, insecurity and corruption.
They however weaved multiple threads tangled together.
Regime was more hybrid - social spending increased but relied upon revenue from agribusinesses and extractives, state expanded.

Government supporters might have been people who objected to this trajectory or thought it was not far enough, or that insecurity could be addressed by reform to security forces or the latter of higher policing. Some people may perceive and want a state on Anglo-Saxon lines and others not: policies that control inflation and allow governments to borrow. Or, they may want a change from a regime that is corrupt and undemocratic.

Meanwhile, organized social groups such as trade unions and neighbourhood assemblies conducted their moral politics of opposition in the form of social and economic projects that could be articulated through a set of specific demands ... Such a politics expresses outrage and uses moral language but tends very consciously to propose (or oppose) specific material measures...In response, especially to the firings, there has been a renewed wave of protest from some unions and other collective organizations such as popular cooperatives. In a worrying development in recent months, those protests have increasingly been subject to violent state repression, which is also condemned in moral language.

- Attitudes to the government expressed in everyday conversation
- Distilled into moral politics directed at political class
- Mass mobilization, moralization of politics (categories of friend/foe using the vocabulary of morality)
- Antagonism remained: naming of Macri in Panama Paper, subpoena of Cristina for her role in selling options, polariziation of politics
- Complex moral politics of outrage characterized contemporary middle-class politics.
- Antagonism central feature of political culture

The ‘middle class’ mobilizations described in this chapter demanded different things than did the organized workers (who may well be quite middle class themselves, in practice). The first group wanted policies like an end to currency controls and tougher penalties for criminals, while the second put forward a much more anti-neoliberal set of demands, and since Macri’s election, this latter group have had to become even more vocal. Both groups made their claims through a moral language of politics, decrying Cristina Fernández de Kirchner’s corrupt and dictatorial tendencies (as well as her make-up and clothes) on the one side, and the dangers of child hunger or mass redundancies on the other. One is a moral language of disgust and indignation, the other moral language condemns the anti-social effects of government policies or, more recently, expresses outrage at state violence towards protesters.

While I have characterized these as distinct moral languages of politics, and would argue that they do cluster in the ways that I have outlined, it should be remembered that they are not in practice confined exclusively to one group or the other, and there are overlaps, not least in the condemnation of political corruption. This shows that in thinking about the relation between moral politics and political economy, we should watch that we do not assume that one kind of political expression (‘progressive’) is more likely than another to be articulated through a moral language. This also means that we should be careful before saying simply that the right has appropriated the technologies (e.g. street mobilization) and language of the left. That said, we should also recognize that this does happen as well, as with the language of corruption – and even, perhaps, of indignation.
