# The sinister signs of QAnon: Interpretive agency and paranoid truths in alt-right oracles

## Article Introduction
### Why study this specific event or phenomenon?

High winds wedged the Ever Given, a cargo ship, in the Suez Canal. For the QAnon conspiracy theories, Evergreen had been the code name for Hillary Rodham Clinton - therefore, Hillary Clinton must be using the ship to carry out her global child sex trafficking scheme.

Today, we shall focus on the neglected matter of QAnon's distinctive relationship to signs and symbols. I suggest the poetic forms have social effects that have contributed to Qanon's popularity - examining the semiotic ideology that it has been written about.

This article follows a person named Q. They have been purposely used with generic pronouns of 'they.' 

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Context

There is the supposed Deep State - comprised of global anti-Trump forces - with the conspiratorial cabal brainwashing the masses into complacent liberalism whilst the worst formed networks that practice paedophilia, cannibalism and Satanism.

Q's followers fantasized of 'the storm' - wherein the military seize the country's infrastructure, arrest or executive top democrats and implement a far-right totalitarian system. "Where we go one, we go all."

It became a quick imagined community ([[Benedict Anderson]]).

### Alt-signalling and Q's communicative style (2)

They repeatedly urged followers to 'listen carefully', 'pay attention' or that 'you are watching the greatest intelligence operation in history.' This framing language suggested that followers could divine partially hidden information through close reading.

"Alt-signalling involves a mirroring of form and content, where indirect, ambiguous, or cryptic semiotic forms are used to allude to sinister, illicit or conspirational dynamics."

Donald dog-whistled, using coded statements that seemed benign to naïve listeners and often walked back his remarks as 'just words', 'sarcasm' or 'joking'.

```ad-example
"At a press conference in May 2020, for instance, he alluded to ‘Obamagate’ – a floating signifier, never clearly defined – as he made vague references to ‘terrible things that happened’ and ‘crimes’ beneath the façade of the Obama administration. In August 2020, Trump informed Fox News’ Laura Ingraham that Biden was being controlled by ‘people in the dark shadows’, ‘people that are control-ling the streets’, and mysterious ‘thugs’ wearing black uni-forms on a plane. Such innuendo left his listenership to fill in the blanks with the fantasized menace of their choosing. Along the way, Trump perpetually suggested that he was conveying critical information in veiled fashion while encouraging suspicious reading of Democrats’ actions. He implied that there is so much concealed malfeasance among his enemies and hidden counter-scheming among his allies that citizens must read beneath the surface of signs to discern the real."

This is a form of alt-signalling, gesturing towards sinister truths that can only be hinted at.

Q does not offer answers to their questions - it allows the reader to infer. For the questions - "What is the Mayo Clinic? Who sits on the BOD [Board of Directors] there?"  Q followers know that Q is seeking subterranean answers, the cumulative effect of so many questions suggest everything is subject to suspicion.

Q liked to coin aphorisms to guide Anons in their world view - Future shows past, future answers past, future proves past.

IAM (IAMBECAUSEWEARE) interprets the Q drops through interpretive liberties that make them hang together - Q examines the final word of the drop, Speed, to the 1994 Speed and adjusts that elements of the film's plot are analogous to Trump's saving the US from 'evil groups.'

"Through such clue-dropping, Q thus enlisted Anons in decryption activity, including looking up facts about media figures or the financial underpinnings of media organizations while making sinister underpinnings. Anons also learned to draw connections within and between Q-drops..." (10)

### Apophenia

Q encouraged apopheia - illusory pattern perception, the perception of patterns among random or seemingly unconnected signs.

Apophenia seems to appeal to the disenchanted who mistrust conventional authority: for instance, it is rampant among the conspiracy-minded UFO believers documented by [[Lepselter]]." (10).

"Some of the interpretive devices they used to seek patterns and draw connections included the 'Q-map' which diagrams a baffling web of ostensible political, economic, and conspirational relations between hundreds of entities in the US and across the world, and the 'Q-clock', a spiral of dates around a clock face with highlights marking dates when a Q-drop occurred." (11)

"Like many Anons, IAM concluded that a high-profile figure like Barack Obama had been ‘extracted’ from the Atlanta airport into custody, presumably for crimes against humanity. Why Obama? Q’s encouragement to think about double meanings conjugated with the community’s encompassing lens of racist paranoia. Since Q encour-aged Anons to think in terms of ‘double meanings’, some inferred that the term ‘darkness’ alluded not only to the airport blackout but also to Obama, because, in the words of one Anon, ‘BO [Barack Obama] has dark skin’, while darkness ‘describes something such as evil being dark power [sic]’." (11)

### Secrecy, Security and Militarism

```ad-quote
title: 12
As if to underscore the state-level potency of QAnon and The Storm, much of Q’s language had a militaristic feel, and Anons took these stances up in turn. Q used terms from the military lexicon such as ‘Defcon’ (a level of mil-itary readiness for war) and ‘kill box’ (a target area for integrating co-ordinated joint weapons fire). Anons fol-lowed suit, referring to themselves sometimes as ‘digital soldiers’. Occasionally, Q used onomatopoetic weapon sounds, such as ‘BOOM/BOOM/BOOM/BOOM’, while foreboding incantations such as ‘Stay calm’ and ‘Nothing can stop what’s coming’ seemed to augur violence. Anons on Twitter often used the same phrases and sound effects, as well as emojis of skulls or hammers. One Anon with thousands of followers in the run-up to the 2020 election liked to tweet a stand-alone period he called a ‘muster sign’; his followers, other Anons, would post their period as if he was taking a roll call. It is no coincidence, of course, that some of the violent insurrectionists at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 were fervent QAnon adherents.Q and Anons jointly constructed one another’s power. Anons looked to Q for omniscient clues, while Q handed Anons their ‘baking’, or research activity, allowing them to partake of (what felt like) a thrilling secret, the genesis of an aggressive new state, and the heady democratization of expertise. Together, they consolidated a vaguely occult semiotic ideology: signs from Q, Trump, and their allies were decrypted for underlying information, while signs from the liberal enemy were to be read with suspicion. Q’s semiotic ideology was thoroughly co-mingled with pre-existing modes of ostensibly straight-talking political com-munication (see McIntosh 2020). It appeared to function, to use Peter Pels’ words, as a contemporary ‘counterpoint to liberal understandings of modernity’s transparency and rational process’ (2003: 3). Ironically, Q’s communication dynamics mirrored their imagination of the enemy’s Deep State, both being sinister and half-hidden.
