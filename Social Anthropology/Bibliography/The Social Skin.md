[[Introducing symbolism, signifiers standing for signifieds]]

The surface of the body behaves as not only the boundary of the individual as a biological and psychological entity but as the frontier of the social self as well.

The problems involved are ones all societies undergo - a society's ways of socialising individuals, integrating them to which they belong, not as children but throughout their lives.

The surface of the body becomes the symbolic stage upon which the drama of socialization is enacted and bodily adornment becomes the language it is expressed.

The adornment of the body is a serious matter.

The Kayapo are a native trade of the southern borders of the Amazon forest - living in widely scattered villages. The economy is a mixture of forest horticulture, and hunting and gathering - a complex system of institutions. The basic social unit is the extended family household, boys live in the households of their wives upon marriage.

They possess a code of 'dress' - a well turned out male may have a lower lip plug, a penis sheath, large holes pierced through ear lobes, red and black body paint, shaved head. A closer look shows that the 'savage' is covered in a fabric of cultural meaning as a Victorian.

The first point is about notions of cleanliness - Kayapo must bathe once a day, it is conceived as a state of full and proper integration of the social world whereas illness is conceived in terms of the natural and animal forces. The removal of facial and bodily hair carries this principle of transforming the skin from naturalness to a social filter.

Inside the skin, hair grows. Outside, it is dead. The hair of the head focuses the dynamic and unstable quality of the frontier between the natural forces of the inner body and external sphere of social relations.

So important that variations in coiffure have become the principal visible means of distinguishing one tribe from another. Some categories of people are privileged to wear their hair long, others must keep it short - children, adolescents, mourners must have their hair short. Penis sheathers keep it long.

Why?

Parents are though to be connected to their children and siblings, a tie of a spiritual continuation of the common physical substance that they share through conception and the womb. The death of a person's child or sibling thereby diminishes his or her own biological being and energies. In so much sorts of biological relationships are cut off by death, is the symbolically appropriate response to the death of a spouse as well as a child.

Nursing infants hair is never cut, seen as extensions of the biological and sexual being of their long-haired parents. Cutting the hair symbolises the severance of this bio-sexual continuity. The child's hair remains short as a sign of its biological separation from its parents.

Society is epitomized for the Kayapo by the system of communal societies and age sets - a collective organisation a primarily male domain. They are defined in terms of criteria for recruitment, defined as a corollary of some important transformation in family or household structure.

Men reproduce society through the transformation of their natural biological and libidinal powers into collective forms. Women, by contrast, reproduce the natural biological individual, the elementary family. It follows that women's biological forces of reproduction should be exercised only within the framework of the structure of men.

The penis sheath symbolises the collective appropriation of male powers of sexual reproduction for the purpose of social reproduction - the appropriation of natural powers for social purposes implies the suppression of their natural or socially unrestrained forms of expression - a channelling of male libidinal energies into social form by restraining the natural expression of male sexuality.

Pierced ear plugs have social meanings - on faculties of understanding and active self-expression. They distinguish between passive and active modes of knowing. Passive understanding is associated with hearing, active knowledge of how to make and do things with seeing - the development of the ability to 'hear' language. To hear and see language, you must have a hole in one's ear.

The author suggests that the piercing and stretching of these 'holes-in-the-ear' is a metaphor for the socialisation of the understanding.

The lip-plug is the most striking piece as only men have their lips pierced. Public speaking is the most characteristic attribute of senior manhood, the medium of political power. A metrical chanting known as *ben* is the distinctive prerogative of chiefs, who are called chanters.

They are the supreme expression of the values of Kayapo society considered as a politically ordered hierarchy.

Through the symbolic medium of bodily adornment, the body of every Kayapo becomes a microcosm of the Kayapo body politic.

As a man grows old, he retires from active political life, speaking in public less often, assuming an elder statesman's role of appealing to common values and interests rather than to take sides.

Their lip plugs are more aesthetic - six inches in length, one one inch in diameter, clear to milky white, Kayapo public life is characteristic of the content of the oratory of old men, giving its prestige.

Two main aspects to the art of body painting - one concerning the association of thee two main colours used and the other concerning the two basic styles employed in painting that part of the body for which black is used.

The use of the two colours reveal a dimension of the makeup of a human as a biological being and social actor: Black is applied to the trunk, the arms, and things. Black stripes are painted on the cheeks, forehead, eyes and mouth. Red - calves, feet, forearms, face.

Black is associated with the idea of transformation between society and unsocialised nature. The word for black is applied to the zone outside the village that one passes through to enter the wild forest - it is the word for death. The term for black applies to a spatial or temporal zone of transition between the social world and the world of natural or infra-social forces closed from society proper. Black applied to the surface is conceived to be the seat of its natural powers and energies. The black skin is the repressive boundary between the natural power of the individual and the external domain of social relations.

Red is associated with notions of vitality, energy and intensification - applied to the peripheral points of the body that have come into contact with the outside world. The contrasting colours establishes a binary classification of the human body and its powers and relates that classification to the opposition.

The second aspect, the main style of painting in black: there is one for children (which is elaborate) and one for adults.

The result is unique, and the child is painted by their mother or relation. This reflects the social position of the young child and the nature of the process of socialization.

Boys cease to be painted in this style except when they leave home to live in the men's house. Older girls and women continue to paint one another in this was as an occasional past time. This reflects how women identify with their individual families and households whereas men identify with collective groups.

The second style is associated with adults. Lots of standardised designs. The adult style with its animal designs epitomises these meanings - the transformation of animal qualities into social form.

They also do long and complex ceremonies - these events are distinguished by collective body-painting and renewed coiffures in the tribal pattern. Certain items of regalia distinguish those receiving names or being initiated from the mass of celebrants. The most important ceremonies are rites of baptism or initiation - spectators don't wear costumes here, and the parents of the children being initiated who must work to supply the dancers with food must be treated with great disrespect.
 
Bodily adornment shows stratification of social forms.

The names bestowed here belong to a class of 'beautiful' names which are passed down from categories of kinsmen. Children being honoured are adorned with special regalia. The black bracelets (literally 'black bone marrow') are actually painted red: we could say something about symbolism or whatever. It doesn't matter that much.

Black and red are symbols of repression and sensory accentuation and the accentuation of sexuality and procreativity in the service of social reproduction are involved. What is blackened or repressed is the inner substance of the bones, conveying the idea of the suppression of the pre-social, biological basis of social relatedness whereas the red expresses the activation of this basis in the social form represented by the bracelet themselves. The initiation bracelets condense within themselves a number of the principles of the whole system of bodily adornment and social concepts it expresses.

They also use ritual wear - wound cotton string, breast plumage. They denote an aspect of the social identity. They call this wealth or riches.


They connect beauty and wealth in the form of bodily adornment - expressed in choral hymns.

Birds fly and can scan the whole world, not confined by its divisions, transcending them in an experience of totality.

Two aspects of this notion embodied in ritual costume and sacred activities to where they're worn - bodily adornment stresses the imposition of social form upon the natural energies and power of the individual. Secondly, sacred costumes reverse the meaning of everyday bodily-adornment - the latter is based upon a relation between the natural core and a social periphery (the human body and the space outside the body). Ritual space in contrast is based on the relationship between a natural periphery and a social centre.

Ritual relations connect grandparents and grandchildren, uncles and nephews, skipping over connecting relatives who may be described as indirect relations.

The ritual system represents a balancing of accounts, the dispersed natural relations of the parents become the key indirect relations - whose identification with the children of the same parents become the point of this ritual - it reasserts a connection between the dispersed relations of the parents' previous relations with the not-yet-socially-integrated relations of the parents present family. This is on a new indirect footing with no natural basis.

Socialisation has been achieved through the transference of attributes of the identity of natural relations located on the periphery of the family to the actor located at its centre.

The symbolic integration of natural attributes from the periphery of social space as aspects of the social identity of actors.

There is another value - dominance, by combination of prestige, authority, individual autonomy and ability to control others.

The lack of a term there is no doubt of the existence of the value in question and its importance as the organising focus of Kayapo social and political life outside the ritual sphere. It reaches its zenith in the public activities of senior men.


These two values - dominance and beauty - inform the activities and goals of every Kayapo, constituting the most general purposes of social action and personal identity. Bodily adornment encodes these values, defining the social identity of the individual, mediating between individuals.

The social skin models the social boundary between actors and other actors but on a deeper level it models the internal psychic diaphragm between the pre-social energies of the individual and the social meanings. At a macro-social level th emodification of skins define categories or classes of individuals. The social skin is the third level of interpretation, the boundary between social classes.
