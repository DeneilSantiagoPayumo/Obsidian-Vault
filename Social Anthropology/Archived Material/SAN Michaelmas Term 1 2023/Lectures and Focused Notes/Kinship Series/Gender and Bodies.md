# Lecture notes: Gender and Bodies

This lecture will cover kinship anthropology of the 1940's-1960's: Structural Functionalism and Structuralist Claude Levi-Strauss, the anthropology of women and the emergence of gender, and an ethnographic case: Boddy -**female circumcision in Sudan.**

## [[Radcliffe-Brown]] - Types of Descent and Kinship Systems

Anthropologists doing work on kinship saw themselves as seeing the means of which pre-industrial societies organized themselves. For them like Morgan, kinship seemed to encompass politics, religion and economics, ensuring that what was relevant to kinship was relevant for the discipline as a whole.

The presumption was that by studying kinship you could unearth the core principles of any society.

The early anthropologists left River's genealogy method - proclaiming that kinship was not related to blood and genealogy, but descent and lineage. There was two dominant methods at the time on how to study kinship: the relations between parents and children, and between marriage partners.

Radcliffe-Brown finds:
Unilineal descent - descent reckoned through a **single line** - male or female
	Patrilineal or agnatic - descent traced from an ancestor through unbroken chain of male links
	Matrilineal or uterine - descent traced from an ancestress through unbroken chain of female links

Cognatic descent - descent traced from ancestor or ancestress down through a series of links **both male or female or any combination of the two.**

The two British kinship theorists - [[Evans-Pritchard]] and more studied Radcliffe-Brown. [[Evans-Pritchard]] looked at the Nuer and argued that the lineage of the Nuer tied to its political descent - making claim to the Nuer Segmentary Lineage System.

The argument goes that if person who represents Family I is in conflict with Family II then members of that Segment A will band together against major segment B.

This work gets picked up by [[Barth]] who makes an argument that "I against my brothers, my brothers and I against my cousins; my cousins, my brothers and I against the world."

Some of the things that Pritchard doesn't focus on is colonialisation... strangely enough.

*Skipped some...*

It's not as though people in the 40s and 50s recognised the complexity of kinship: who is doing that reproductive work, who does the work of care to ensure that babies grow into adults.

## [[Meyer Fortes]]

```ad-quote
title: Good on Fortes, 1996: 313
"Whether he is worshipping ancestors, arranging marriages, allocating work, or exerting judicial authority, a Tallensi man's rights and responsibilities are determined by his position in his partilineage. So, although lineage membership is determined by kinship criteria, its functions are economic and political."
```


## [[Claude Levi-Strauss]] - Structuralism (also Alliance Theory)

In *Elementary Structures of Kinship* he argued that marriage is what formed kinship relations. In every society, there was an incest taboo: it is the first moment of culture that defines whom you may or may not marry.

Thus, we must avoid sexual intercourse with mothers and sisters but instead to enjoin sexual intercourse and marriage outside the social group.

It is a primary act of classification that determines who we need to marriage. For Levi-Strauss this kinship is the basis of sociality: he made the claim that "War is engage gone wrong." In small scale societies we can see this vividly. Levi-Strauss argues that "Incest is socially absurd before it is morally culpable." These societies have recognised that for groups to survive we must be social and the boundaries we draw of our sociality are the boundaries that mark social relations.

What we got out of an outcome of structuralism is the analysis of society through binaries: 

Symmetric or direct exchange: women from group A marry men from group B, and women from B marry men from A.

All marriage involve first cross-cousin (cross cousins are the children of brothers and sisters.)

Generalised or indirect exchange: A's women marry B's men but B's women must marry C's men and C's women marry D's men and so on... so that group A are the "wife-givers" to Group B.

Marriage in this form generates enduring patters from one generation to the next.

## [[Gayle Rubin]]

In seeing the essence of kinship systems to lie in the exchange of women between men, Levi-Strauss constructs an implicit theory of sex oppression: places the oppression of women in social systems rather than biology.

For Rubin, the exchange of women is a deeply problematic concept. Levi-Strauss argues that this exchange is the natural difference between men and women is best and what we see instead is an oppression of natural similarities. 

Of course men and women are different from they are not "as different as day and night, earth and sky, yin and yang, life and death."

Women were prominent in anthropological account ([[Michelle Rosaldo]]) and so the problem was not that there was insufficient data about women, just that it was built on the natural basis of kinship that was constructed by men, women are which seen as a part but their contribution as to how a society functions never extended beyond the domestic context.

What we need to know then is "what kind of questions we learn to ask."

## [[Anthony Good]]

He argues that a lot of writing on kinship was written by men and damn right chauvinistic, assuming a male point of view. Men did exchange women and marriage, but what was striking was that the male vantage was replicated by presenting one point of view.

## [[Rayna Better]]

A major goal was to establish an anthropology of women - born of the feminist movement that wanted to understand why women seemed to occupy a lesser place in so many different societies.

Feminist anthropologists found themselves at loggerheads with western feminism for its disregard of the culturally varied ways in which to e a woman, or to exercise power or agency.

Look at the more famous anthropologists: [[Margaret Mead]], [[Audrey Richards]] and more.

## 1970s - 3 debates on the universal subordination of women

1. Domestic / public politics (Rosaldo, 1974))
2. Nature / Culture (Ortner, 1974)

Ortner asked if what is the subordination of women was natural to their role in child bearing, child rearing and those associated with nature, widely regarded as simple, unelaborated, pristine. Women's naturally roles were culturally elaborated the word over as such - in other words, women's association with nature was a cultural phenomenon that needed an explanation. In transforming babies who are called close to nature to adults, women were tasked with the transformation of the role of the natural child to adult, through it - associating it with a devalued natural and instead the value of cultural sphere.

3. Reproduction / production (Endholm et al 1977)

Women's reproductive roles in peasant societies were underlined, and their role in production was obscured.

Francis Pine argued that in each of these approaches, each saw the oppression of women in these social structures and culture, not biology.

Michelle Rosaldo:
"We would do well to think of biological sex, like biological race, as an excuse rather than a cause for any sexism we observe."

Last few thoughts:
Sex is seen as anatomical way - lay in the givenness of male bodies and gender was its cultural forms. In the 1960s the concept of gender is used in anthropology, the term was that it addressed male and female.

## Gender

Gender "referred to the **symbols, behaviours, roles, and statuses"** associated with sex.
[[Janice Boddy]] was doing research on circumcision in rural northern Sudan. Western feminists had strong and unyielding views. This recognised the ways that western anthropologists have negotiated their dual influences.

Her sense of shock at the meaninglessness of the custom when she first witnessed it - she arrived in June at the height of the summer when schools are closed. The rights of girls and boys were complementary - girls were circumcises to remove the clitoris to remove their reproductive organs. The action involved a local anaesthetic and infibulation - the vagina being occluded by skin, leaving a small opening of the vulva.

Boys are made to be like men - they are removed of the foreskin of the penis.

Arguably - better sexual relations? The mid-wife is made to deliver the child. What they argue is that circumcision is a symbolic act to generate virginity, taking on a social category - virgins are made not born. The process de-emphasizes a women's sexuality but looks at fertility, looking at future mothers of men.

People say between us is flesh and blood - between us there is women who are married. It is customary, necessary and enigmatically. This characterisation of heat and pain.
