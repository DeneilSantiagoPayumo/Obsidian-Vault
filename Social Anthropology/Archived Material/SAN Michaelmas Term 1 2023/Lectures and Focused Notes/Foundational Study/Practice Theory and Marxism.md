## Lecture notes:

## Topic one: Introduction

This starts in the 1980s.
It is host to multiple theorists such as Giddens, Bourdieu, Sahlins, Ortner.
Their main focus is on power and inequality, reconciling structure and agency, structure and history.

Essentially, how structures affect individual agency or how structures affect history.

They focus primarily on the body: the embodiment, the sense of doing things in the world. 

## Topic two: [[Karl Marx]]

Happened in 1950s and 60s, closely tied with thinking about the power relations to the anthropologists in the field - labour, factory work, poverty.

It brings with Marxism a whole set of broader concepts - a ten minute introduction. Some of the key things that are relevant would be the distinction between infrastructure and superstructure: infrastructure is the economic base whereas superstructure refers to science, law, religion and philosophy.

Anthropologists must think - what goes where

Dialects - the idea that we have a conflict between a thesis and antithesis, and we will create synthesis and something changes.
Of course, synthesis may result in a new anthesis.

This is known as historical materialism - the idea that changing material conditions affects history. Who has what? How do they use it? It is an evolutionist theory but compared to structuralism, functionalism or whatnot, they discover how things *change*, not how they *are* like in the aforementioned.

It as sus to discuss tensions and disagreements. 

Praxis - labour, a philosophical image of human beings as reducing value through labour. Capitalism rips people away from labour.

"The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living." - these struggles affect people, affecting the interface on people and their systems.

## Topic three: Practice Theory

"Practice theory seeks to explain the relationships that obtain between human action on one hand, and some global entity which we may call 'the system,' on the other." - Ortner.

Agency and structure should be linked together.
Politics and economy should be linked together.
History (change) and structure (stability) should be linked together.

Evolutionism - change, Interpretivism / Structuralism / Functionalism - stability.

### Pierre Bourdeiu:

We use him in SAN for his argument for social anthropology: a big critic that anthropology isn't just to observe. It is to free social life.

"Against "objectivist" social analysis we need a theory of practice" - strategies, not 'rule following'.

We need a theory that's not looking at rules of the game but strategies - that sits between structure and agency. A strategy is a move in a game but it is a *move*, of someone *doing* something.

Class and social reproduction - taste is culturally conditioned, culturally conditioning. People who have 'social capital' are brought up in a certain way that makes people acknowledge their class.

Class discrimination is hidden under values of universal domination.

Bourdieu uses this concept of habitus from Mauss - techniques of the body.

### Sherry Ortner

A piece on the theory of anthropology - for instance, the US where she introduces practice theory.

"I will argue that a new key symbol of theoretical orientation is emerging, which may be labelled "Practice" for "action" or "praxis". This is neither a theory nor a method but a symbol in the name of which a variety of theories and methods are being developed. 

## Examples:

Ghliko.

Men are expected to socialise off work and in the meantime women are expected to socialise in their own and each other's homes.

That expectation is correlated with different kinds of food: what we tend to be drink is hard liquid whereas women are expected to drink and eat 'the women's drink' - a syrupy drink, jellied fruits, candied chocolate.

When interviewed, they argued women like softer drinks and men like harder drinks. Maybe we can consider this as a symbolism of gender - women are softer, sweeter and men are tougher.

Let's consider the fact that many people believe this. Well, this is how people are socialised! There's a naturalization of certain kinds of taste. This is given political and gendered meaning.

There's a way we naturalize taste and food. Food gets naturalized to stabilize gender decisions. It is also about inequality and political economy - women stay at home and make sure that their food is really nice whereas men talk about politics.

What happens when something changes like a kafeteria? This is a cool new thing with shining lights and is where you go in a big town. This is the place where you drink hard and sweet things.. Suddenly, people debate what kind of place this is. Is this a place for women? Is this a place for men? Is it for both? A new space opens up and now norms of socialisation change.

This is the other side of practice theory: how can people break social boundaries, and why some people choose not to. This is the interface between historical change and structure.

It's not 100% straightforward of how things get better. Even though the introduction of the kafeteria change genders, at the same time, you can read this another way: there used to be a traditional economy here and now Capitalism has changed everything again.

It's trying to keep in view the ways in which things change and how structures are introduced.
