>Despite its pervasive homophobia, everyday life in urban Democratic Republic of Congo is full of queer affordances that are of particular interest for understanding larger socioeconomic changes, shifting gender dynamics, and recurring cosmopolitan aspirations. Ethnographic fieldwork in Kinshasa and Kisangani reveals how male same-sex desire is produced, distributed and consumed in a 'homoerotic economy' that generates its own characteristic instabilities. My interlocutors constantly renegotiate this economy's dominant logic of penetration and solve its underlying "problem" of sexual versatility through a creative vocabulary of erotic SIM cards. Closely analysing these processes sheds new light on the hegemonic notions of sexual "activity" and "passivity" as particularly unstable markers of erotic belonging.

### Summary:

Ethnographic fieldwork in Kinshasa and Kisangani reveals how everyday discursive practices created a gendered constellation of interrelated erotic categories through which men and boys like Prince and his friends think and live this world, their selves, and their desires. Close attention to such categories showcase how this will lead to a contradictory homoerotic economy that reflects broader societal changes and shifting urban gender dynamics, while simultaneously reproducing and inverting dominant erotic ideologies.

Here, we will look at how local erotic practices and performative identities resonate with material and imaginary processes at work on a global scale - visualizing how this economy produces its own contradictions and instabilities to be negotiated by individual agents, exploring the suggestive category of the 'dual sim card.'
## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Dual-SIM versatility

The vernacular differentiation between active and passive worlds emerges in frequent discussions about the conceptual problems posed by men and boys who are, and can simultaneously or successively occupy both subject position.

Suh discussion are a direct consequence of the binary organization of the homoerotic matrix - everyday reality shows that hybrid experiences are far more common than people often admit.

```ad-example
Returning back to Herve, the young man who tries to combine a tough and noneffeminate gender identity with unspoken desires for his aventurier friends. He accepts the proposals of a somewhat older reglo with whom he managed to stay for several months.

While avoiding dates with fioto men, he accepts the proposal of a somewhat older reglo. His lover eventually accused him of having a double sim card. This expression strikingly reflects the issue of sexual versatility.
```

By analogy, people who 'have a dual SIM card' are supposedly unreliable and untrustworthy - you never know whose side they are on and they can always turn against you. Dual-SIM accusations point at an internal classification problem within the homoerotic matrix.

```ad-quote

Dual-SIM accusations point at an internal classification problem within the homoerotic matrix, a problem within the homoerotic matrix, a problem about 'sexual versatility' - similar accusation are not voiced against what seems to be 'bisexuality.' Urban Congolese do not consider male desire for both men and women as a form of hypocrisy but rather take it for granted as the default state of "normal" desire. From a fioto perspective, "normal" men's cross-sex desires need to be stronger than their same-sex ones in order to remain normal ... As a result, enduring same-sex love somehow appears a logic (if not practical) impossibility because of the gendered logics at work in the homoerotic economy itself.


```

This practical versatility does not redefine their erotic subjectivity as a sexually hybrid one. There is therefore a profound asymmetry at work in dual-SIM-card accusations: men who supposedly have a dual SIM card are always considered essentially fioto men who "deny" their passive desires and "pose" as "normal" men rather than the other way around - fioto-identifying men never have  a dual SIM card because their feminine desire for being penetrated by "real" men does not contradict their capacity for penetration.

What really matters is the absence of passive desires (to be penetrated) which overrule "normal" desires when it comes to everyday erotic identification and classification.

Why is it that fioto desire needs to be explained and accounted for: firstly, many consider male passive desires for penetration a taboo as they open up male bodies, attacking normal masculinity and secondly because fioto desire is a dissident force because people see it as essentially excessive and out of control and are unable to control their *folle* nature.

The vernacular conceptualisation of sexual versatility as a dual SIM card suggests certain assumptions about the "nature" of desire that are not directly voiced as such by my interlocuters but can be inferred from the logics inherent in the homoerotic economy.

Sexually versatile people are said to possess two SIM cards, those positioned at one or the other moiety of our matrix must necessarily possess only one. We can infer the existence of a "normal" SIM card and a fioto one - whereby the latter capture the network of "normal" men and the former captures a fioto world.

Many assume that the encoding of desire to be a gradual process, moulded by environment and social interactions. The conceptualization of desire through the language of SIM cards thus suggested that one's desires are effectively changeable over time. This changeability strongly resonates with understandings that one gets "initiated" into the homoerotic economy as a passive partner of a usually older man to be promoted into a normal position.

### The axis:

```ad-important

```

The Y axis uses a gendered logic of penetration - men who penetrate and those who get penetrated. It reintroduces a male-female binary within same-sex relationships and ideologically "heterosexualizes" same-sex desire as an erotic dynamic necessarily arising between masculine and effeminate men.

Fioto reflects subject positions marked by effeminate masculinity, signalled through performances of hyper femininity and an assertion of erotic dissidence. Michel, one of the fioto men in Kisangani, define themselves against other men and other girls through this femininity. Their boyfriends however are just "normal" men who have a taste for sex with men. In effect, dating fioto men and boys can be a way to make rather than break one's reputation - these "normal" men do not give rise to a specific erotic identity but remain virtual.

The X axis represents another distinction along the lines of respectability. Those who "respect themselves" and avoid "bringing shame" to their families conform to social norms that label same-sex practices as sinful. On the lower side of this scheme, this axis of reputation mark a distinction between *folles* and *reglos* - the latter designate unremarkable fioto men and boys who keep their erotic identity within the boundaries of respectability, the former are "crazy" enough to be publicly visible.

On the upper side of the scheme, the axis of reputation differentiates between men who conform to moral and social expectations of male adulthood of responsibility and restraint and those who transgress such gendered norms.

### \Erotic labels - *naza branche*

Everyday realities are effected by popular homophobic discourses that inform widely shared negative attitudes and sometimes hostile reactions to people perceived as gender nonconforming or sexually deviant.

This creates a context in which sexual dissidence is better kept secret so thus people can't discuss this in public. Such conventional silence creates conditions in which same-sex erotic *acts* remain surprisingly unproblematized: homoerotic practices are not necessarily problematic as such as long as they remain unspoken and do not threaten the public status, heterosexual marriages, and procreative ambitions of those who engage in them.


What do we mean by "this world" of men and boys who have sex with each other? The author conceptualizes this "world" as a homoerotic economy that overlaps with, emerges from and actualizes an inherent potential of a mainstream urban erotic rather than a 'different' world or subculture.


```ad-quote
The homoerotic economy is a gendered constellation of power relations that produce a dynamic set of interrelated erotic subject positions, erotic identities and vectors of desire between individual male bodies who take up these subject positions and construct identities with different degrees of reflexivity. (233)
```

The homoerotic economy is an extant and imaginary network of interrelated subject positions that are libidinally invested and entangled in the unspoken homoerotic affordances of everyday urban life that exceed sexual contact and resonate with societal changes.

Labelled identities arise from erotic subject positions as side effects of larger socioeconomic dynamics at work in contemporary urban culture.


The axis of respectability introduces a gradient which one occupies. The *reglo* interlocutors keep their effeminacy in check and only showcase their true faces whenever they are protected by darkness, and even the craziest of *folles* restrain themselves in front of parents, pastors, and state agents. Even the most daring aventuriers keep a low profile when they find themselves in spaces where an explicit performance of transgressive masculinity have them removed.

The second axis has a productive contradiction between publicly valued respectability and fascination with transgression. The axis of respectability seems to account for a *generational* dynamic - in the economy that pushes people, as they grow older, from the right hand side to the left hand side, also reflecting how hegemonic masculinity is shifting from the respectable *papa* to the urban *aventurier*.

Ongoing socioeconomic changes, which make attaining male status as a married and providing housefather increasingly difficult, produce a context in which such performances of transgression become central to alternative masculinities. (235)

The homoerotic economy needs to be understood as a historically situated assemblage of subject positions.

These axes reproduce broader cultural registers of penetration and reputation - the matrix they give rise to provides a heuristic structure to understand the overall dynamics of homoerotic desire. Interlocutors occupy different subject positions.

```ad-example
Herve is an aventurier regular who rejects the sexual propositions of fioto men. Instead, he wants young *swaggeurs* like himself - his desires emerge from the homoerotic affordances and possibilities of homoerotic aventurier masculinity while his refutations of effeminacy signal his struggles against the gendered ideology of penetration that would push him towards a fioto position.

He claims to belong to this world of homosexuals, and voices this through the saying, "I am connected" - expressing a connection to one and the same homoerotic economy. On one hand, this saying (*naza branche*) refers to a common sphere of social interactions and erotic encounters but also it denotes an invisible network of people who are "in the know" and occupy different subject positions. On the other hand, it reflects the "wider world" out there.
```

It expresses a claim of membership in a wider global society - mobilizing cosmopolitan aspirations and highlight how dissident sexual practices capture a global modernity and transcend so-called African customs and traditions. Cosmopolitanism is reproduced through performances of gendered dissidence and this saying frames the person making that claim as a capturing device.

Fioto men pose as a connection to the outsider network - these self-representations continuously feed a popular imaginary in which sexual dissidence is read as a "sign of connection" and can capture hidden networks that otherwise remain hidden.

In one sense, this network refers to a world of connected persons. From a fioto perspective, this network comprises a distinct sphere that is different from the "normal" world *and* an inherent part of it: a queer dimension of everyday life that is potentially accessible to everyone as a homoerotic plane of existence that is fundamentally entangled with a broader urban economy of sex, gender and desire. This actual homoerotic world however is a double world split into two halves - a fioto world an a normal one.

In reality, actual erotic practices are less clear cut than what is seemed: some men disconnect their desires and define themselves as "real" gays and even intra-fioto relationships exist.

### Normal masculinity

Its resulting position within the homoerotic economy is never as unproblematic as the gendered binary of penetration suggests.

"Normal" men who find themselves in intimate relationships with fioto partners occupy an extant but unspoken erotic subject positions. Although homoerotic relations can make rather than break one's transgressive reputation, it requires continual work to reconfirm one's supposedly normal desires.

"In bars like Airtel, "normal" men usually emphasize their masculinity by boasting, keeping cool, refusing to talk, pretending to be uninterested and hard to get or behaving coarsely or even violently toward their fioto lovers." Fioto men are preoccupied with reconfirming their boyfriends' "normal" masculinity. This constant repetition and reconfirmation of "normal" masculinity is an effect of the "reversed dynamics of desire", a common characteristic of male same-sex realtionships.

"A dominant erotic ideology genders desire as an inherently masculine, active urge oriented toward a feminine, passive object, the homoerotic matrix generates desires that explicitly disobey this phallic directionality. In effect, presenting themselves as "hunters rather than prey", fioto men and boys usually the initiative and try to "convince" their objects of desire - who are, although always (more or less easily) convincible, not a priori convinced." (239)

The seductive performances of fioto effeminacy contradict the phallic nature of desire and reintroduce the threatening possibility of non-phallic and feminine "initiatives" in an otherwise phallic economy.

These reversed dynamics of desire threaten the position of so-called normal men in the homoerotic economy who thereby appear as passive objects of fioto desire than actively desiring subjects themselves. This apparent forsaking of supposed erotic "activity" by male targets of fioto desire does not directly undermine phallic masculinity. (239).

By explicitly performing masculinity as a prized object of desire can paradoxically save and recursively reconfirm "normal" masculinity. Indeed, given ongoing socioeconomic changes, the explicit objectification of masculinity helps reconfirm normal masculinity, as attaining male status as a providing housefather or notorious womanizer has become increasingly difficult.

This hyperinflation of masculinity as a process of explicit valorisations of male bodies as rarefied objects. Fioto regularly note that explicitly eroticized semi-nude male bodies are present on billboards but regret the frequent self-beautification of their potential partners because it pushes the prize of masculinity upward. Insofar as fioto seduction is seen as a process of "convincing" the other, the objectification of masculinity increases the production of situations that require giving money and gifts to "normal" boyfriends.

In other words, the ... dynamics of homoerotic desire also frequently reverse the so-called trans actionality of sex, that is, the exchange of sex for gifts and money. (239)

This implicit ontology of gendered desire thus accounts for the often-stated impossibility of finding "true" or "serious" same-sex love based on mutual desire between a fioto man and his "normal" boyfriend. In effect, from a fioto perspective, the ideal object of desire is, by definition, a nonresponding one: a "real" man who needs to be tricked and seduced into intimate relations but can never directly express desire himself.  (248)

### Conclusion

This specific homoerotic economy sketched in this article offers a heuristic structure to understand the dynamics of desire between male-bodied people in contemporary urban Congo. It simplifies a more complex erotic reality, the suggested matrix accounts for how the reproduction of and shifts in hegemonic masculinity, new male erotic subject positions and identifies emerge out of libidinal affordances at the urban interface of the local and the global.

As a concept, the homoerotic economy allows us to think about the production, distribution, and consumption of desire between male bodies.
