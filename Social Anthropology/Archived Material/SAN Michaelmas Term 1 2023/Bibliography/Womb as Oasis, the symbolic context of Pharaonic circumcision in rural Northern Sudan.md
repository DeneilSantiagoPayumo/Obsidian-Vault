## Article Introduction

>[!summary]
>Throughout 1976 and part of 1977 I conducted ethnographic research in a small Sudanese village (Hofriyat, a pseudonym) located on the Nile some 200 km downstream of the capital city, Khartoum. Before I arrived in the area I was aware that Hofriyati females underwent genital mutilation in childhood, and I had read several descriptions of that operation (Barclay 1964; Widstrand 1964). Nothing, however, adequately prepared me for what I was to witness, as described herein. Initially I felt numbed by what appeared to be the meaninglessness of the custom; yet, as time passed in the village, I came to regard this form of female circumcision in a very different light. In the present paper I discuss my growing appreciation of its significance, for it is only in understanding the practice, its meaningfulness for the women who undergo it, and its embeddedness in village culture, that those who are presently committed to its eradication (see Assaad 1980; el-Saadawi 1980; Hosken 1979; Morgan and Steinem 1980; participants in the "Khartoum Conference," W.H.O. 1979) might approach the problem with the sensitivity it demands.

The people of Hofriyat are Muslim, endogamous and are organized into patrilineal descent groups. Because of the arable land, younger men regularly leave to seek work in the larger towns and cities.
## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The act of circumcision

For male children, the ceremony of circumcision is rivalled only by that of their weddings. For little girls, a girl remains a girl until she is married - no religious festivals are associated with the event. 

Arguments about the preservation of chastity and curbing of sexual desire is prominent in Sudan or the Muslim world. It represents however causes with effects. What infibulation does is ensure a girl is a virgin - controlling her sexuality by making it so painful. A midwife helps enlarge the genital orifice but reinfibulates the woman when done. Some take this to argue that this regards the notion of virginity as having special importance. Virginity may then be a Western phenomenon, and be a social category in Sudan.

The author argues that it has more in line with sexual abstinence than fertility - controlling their sexuality is not the avowed purpose. It makes a girl clean, smooth and pure - a girl who has not been purified may not marry. Circumcision thus prepares her body for womanhood whereas marriage provides her with the opportunity to advance her position through giving birth.

Explanations for infibulation confuse the sexuality of women with their ability to bear children where these aspects of womanhood ought to be distinguished. They dissociate the sexuality of males from their ability to impregnate women. Infibulation does not increase or limit sexual pleasure to socialise fertility.

```ad-quote
"By removing their external genitalia, women are not so much preventing their own sexual pleasure ... as enhancing their femininity. Circumcision as a symbolic act brings sharply into focus the fertility potential of women by dramatically de-emphasizing their inherent sexuality. By insisting on circumcision for their daughters, women assert their social indispensability ... as mothers of men. The ultimate social goal of a woman is to become, with her husband, the counfounder of a lineage section." (687)

You see, women here gain social recognition by becoming less like men. 

### Interpretation and fertility objects

Among domestic birds, pigeons are considered *tahir* (pure) while chickens are considered *waskhan* (dirty). The former are *tahir* because they splash around in water and reside above the ground in large tins. Chickens are filthy because they eat their own excrement and make a mess.

Young unmarried girls are considered "pigeons going to the market" and dance like a little bird or pigeon walking along the ground.

Whiteness is typically associated with purity and cleanliness. Here: eggs, goat's milk, cheese, cow's milk, fish, rice, sugar and white flower. Also - oranges, jam, bananas, grapefruit, thought of as clean because they are 'contained' from dirty and dryness.

White skin is beautiful and clean and a mark of holiness. Female cosmetics are akin to whiteness - before her wedding, a young girl goes through a regime of physical preparation, removing her body hair, takes a smoke bath until the top layer of her skin is sloughed off. These preparations, more not included, are intended to make her skin soft and lighter in colour.

They bare similarity to the ostrich eggs, objects of fertility placed in women's home when they want children.

In the womb are mixed a man's seed and woman's blood - substance and fluid. It reproduces life and sustains it. Only women through their fertility perform this task.

All enclosed areas in the village are considered clean and protected places - areas of relative safety, where one is less likely to become possessed by malevolent spirits.


The idiom of relative enclosure emerges predominant. The *hosh*, the womb and more, beliefs about the human body, reproduction, imperviousness and fertiltiy appear over and over again.

Sexes are specially and socially segregated - they occupy different sides of the dancing ground. The hosh is spatially divided into separate quarters and the front door is located in the front part of the courtyard near the door. The back door is for women, close male kin and neighbours. Women's quarters are situated at the rear, as is the kitchen. External affairs thereof are handled by men where internal and domestic affairs are handled by women.

Hence, they associate women with internal affairs.

Pharaonic circumcision is an assertive act and should not be viewed through Western lens.

```ad-tldr
"Through it they emphasize what they hold to be the essence of femininity: morally appropriate fertility, the potential to reproduce the lineage or to found a lineage section. In that infibulation purifies, smooths and makes clean the outer surface of the womb, the enclosure or hosh of the house of childbirth, it socialises or, if the phrase be permitted, culturalizes a woman's fertility. Through occlusion of the vaginal orifice, her womb, both literally and figuratively, becomes a social space: enclosed, impervious, virtually impenetrable. Her social virginity, defined by qualities of enclosedness, purity and all the rest, must periodically be reestablishished at those points in her life ... when her fertility once again is rendered potent."
