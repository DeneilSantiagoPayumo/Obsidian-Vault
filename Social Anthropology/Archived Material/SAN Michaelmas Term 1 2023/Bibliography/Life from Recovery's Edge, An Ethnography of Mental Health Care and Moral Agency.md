>[!summary] What is this book about?
> In 2003 the Bush Administration's New Freedom Commission asked mental health service providers to begin promoting "recovery" rather than churning out long-term, "chronic" mental health service users. Recovery's Edge sends us to urban America to view the inner workings of a mental health clinic run, in part, by people who are themselves "in recovery" from mental illness.  

## A summary of the book:

This book follows Myer's interactions with a mental health clinic, Horizons Recovery Centre. Within said clinic there are two different programs, 40-year-side Riverside program struggled to coexist with PEP, a ten month-old-program run by an average of five peer staff. 

The Riverside program has the 'traditional' mental health system focused on harm minimization. Recently, they're trying to accommodate the new 'recovery' process that involves leaving the lives of the disabled in their own hands, empowering them.

In reality this doesn't work for several reasons: the recovery program as prescribed actually diminishes 'moral agency', the ability to make intimate connections.

The PEP program whilst having shortcomings helps to foster intimate relationships that the Riverside program cannot.

The recovery program is made up of three core steps:
1. Take your medication
2. Self-advocate
3. Work for intimacy
### A collection of key ideas from the text

#### Problems with the American 'recovery' process:

```ad-quote
title: The difference between the systems: 155-156
Horizon's interpretation of the recovery process, a person would take a 'recovery journey' of three steps: to become rational, and then autonomous and then hard working and prove themselves worthy of intimate connections with others.

However, this branding of recovery sets a high bar for members who were profoundly stigmatized and alienated in a society.

Trapped in an ever-shifting landscape of poverty, crime, hunger and pain were somehow always different ... few opportunities for gainful employment, medical insurance that required them to remain sick enough to afford their medication.
```

Essentially, this model presumes that to become a good valued citizen, you needed to 'take medication, act with enlightened self-interest and to work hard'. However, when people don't view these adults as worthy of a relationship, they set people up to fall.

You can see this example with Maison, the character of the chapter *STEP ONE: TAKE YOUR MEDICATIONS.*

Maison seemed like the poster-boy for the Riverside program: he is a disabled war veteran who attends Horizon events. He proclaimed one thing: take your medication! However, when the times got tough, and it turned out that the medication that helped Maison function ended up being detrimental as he was diagnosed with lithium poisoning. He suddenly lost everything - had no apartment, lost his position as Horizon's token user of recovery and left.

Myers attributes this to the lack of moral agency.

```ad-quote
title: About Maison: 85
"In the outside world, Maison was a disabled veteran with a long history of substance abuse living on government benefits and estranged from his family ... inside the world of Horizons, he seemed to have access to moral agency while hwas the 'show pony' but this was contingent on good behaviour. When he began to have trouble, there was no safety net for him, no web of intimate connections to catch him as he fell."
```

Let's go to an example of another woman, Margot. As Vera says, 'treat people like a person ... and they will become one.' (74)

She is a schizophrenic who was unmedicated. She was loud and 'seemed to take a perverse joy in shouting obscenities at me.' The goal to her success? Treating her like a normal human being, letting Margot work with Pierre in PEP's kitchen and shouting at each other.

```ad-quote
title: About Margot: 75-76
"The peers offered Margot a level of intimacy most people did not feel they coould offer a psychotic person. Margot used that intimacy to push back against her psychosis and began to respond in kind ... gave her the tools to build a moral life."

```

A key thing here is work. As disabled people lose their relationships, jobs and life goals, they are separated from how they may become recognized as good people and live moral lives.

```ad-quote
title: About work 153
"Without work, the members no longer knew how to act in a way that earned the regard of others and enabled them to become moral agents. They could not access the intimate relationships they needed to learn how to thrive. They struggled to develop their capacity to reimagine what it meant to be good and lead a good life."
```

There are several ways in which the traditional recovery system simply doesn't work:
1. **As seen with Maison, one needs moral agency to cushion the blow of a bad flow.**
2. **A lack of self-advocation: people need to be empowered to become moral agents.**

```ad-quote
title: About self-advocation 119
"Becoming moral agents ... meant understanding the needs of the community and what it meant to become a community member in good standing. This required hard practice with guidance and accountability which members rarely received ... members shared these questions [about recovery] but they seemed to have no voice ... they had no power of their own with which to be empowered, and no capacity to obtain it without intimate relationships, good faith efforts, and a little bit of moral agency."
```

People must be available to make their own choices to gain moral agency. Without agency, without the ability to be hospitalised or not, these people never learned how to obtain intimate relationships.

3. **An inability to be intimate**

PEP members needed to understand how to gain intimacy otherwise they would fail to create it. Riverside staff were unable to be intimate with their clients and Myers draws attention to the 'fee-for-service' paperwork where you must document every 15 minutes you spend with a client. The Horizons model insisted that people must learn to become intimate on their own, but in reality the outside world will not welcome them.

There is also a paradox: "as service members participated in mental health programs and moved away from working, they reported fewer social ties with less diversity and reciprocity in their relationships and felt less satisfied ... the moral regard members cultivated at Horizons, I found, ... did to seem to translate into moral agency in the outside community." (126)

This lack of intimacy is created in several ways: professional boundaries between the riverside staff as staff did not disclose their lives and talked about the lives of their clients behind their back, rules to ignore relationships outside of work *("Can one build one's capacities to engage in intimate relationships without being able to summon the relationships one needs to learn how to be in relationships?"132*) and the inability to show affection and romance among the members. With no way to 'practice' in the community, how can they make it in the world out there?

#### The power of moral agency

We must use a 'logic of care' to borrow from Mol. This logic has three features:
1. Patients cannot always make rational, autonomous choices
2. They can benefit from other's knowledge about the pros and cons of the choices available to them
3. Patients are often active even if they are sharing decision-making with clinicians or others.

Instead of patients dictating their own care, care would be shaped. This is better than the 'logic of choice' that dictates healthcare that expected rational, autonomous patients to make health care decisions.

```ad-quote
title: Moral Agency 156
To even consider a journey of reocvery, this book has made plain, members needed strong, intimate, reciprocal accountable relationships with caring others from the very beginning - relationships that most members had with no one. I have called the ability to cultivate this kind of intimacy moral agency. The concept of moral agency suggests that in order for people to become the kind of person they want to be in the world, the must act in a way that holds them accountable for it. The way that they are expected to act in order to be perceived as "good" must match up with the cultural expectations of the group that they are trying to join, and they will need resources that go beyond financial assistance to help replenish moral agency. This book has illustrated the many ways that members' experiences in mental health care had eroded their moral agency to a point where they needed more help restoring it than the mental health system offered them."
```

With Horizon members facing crime, poverty, hunger, physical and emotional pain, facing victimization in the world out there, no opportunities for employment, medical insurance that required them to remain sick to afford their medication, members struggled to live. 

People need a different sort to address the demoralization, misrecognition, existential crises and catastrophic conditions of everyday survival that affected them most.

```ad-quote
title: What needs to change 156-7
"Radically different relationships, roles and resources were needed to help people invigorate their ability to be recognized as moral agents ... in a way that made possible intimate connections."
```

A list of these outside problems involve:
1. Living in shelters (where people might hurt them or are plainly inaccessible)
2. Cheap hotels (the smell of drugs, alcohol and more, especially as with Monica's story where strangers tried to break into her door to rob or rape her)
3. Nursing homes. There, they lacked control, freedom, forfeiting basic civil rights such as Barry's story, wherein he was forced to change medication despite his insistence that the old medication were better, forcing him to be sick and sending him to the hospital when he 'misbehaved'. Where else can they go from a nursing home? What else can they do there without the skills or the moral agency needed to leave?
4. Incarceration - being assaulted or raped, or facing inadequate levels of care that may lead to high reoffending. High levels of mentally ill people occupy prisons and their needs cannot be met.

Myers finds that there is a 'we' in the centre. A sort of community there. That said, there was a man that came to the centre that took Azura. Azura slept with him for a private room and food as she wanted that baby. Azura's previous lover Bradley confronted her new lover, and she was kicked out. The baby died and they buried her in a shoebox. Bradley and Azura used heroin again.

With all of these events and more, work is not easy for easy for the mentally disabled. To turn members into 'billable' people with psychiatric difficulties, insist they look for employment and fail to integrate them did no favours.

To do that, they must learn intimacy.

Isaac's story - unemployed, hospitalized, defended himself, pressure at work, recovery home. "Reacted like a soldier" He put a member in restraints - much like an orderly in a mental hospital, she said - because the same had been done to him." (144)
