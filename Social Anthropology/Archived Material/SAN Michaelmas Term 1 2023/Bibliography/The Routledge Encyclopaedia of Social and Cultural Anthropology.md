This is a book explaining a vast amount of anthropological terms. Because of its lengthy nature, I will just grab quotations that are of use to me.

### Adoption and fostering 6-7

Both fostering and adoption reveal important cultural assumptions about the processes of relatedness and concepts of personhood. On the island of Langkawi of the coast of Malaysia (Carsten 1991), for example, people are thought to become kin through sharing common food, and thus common substance, and widespread fostering can be related to other ideas about the fluidity and mutability of kinship (a theme more widely encountered in Austonesian societies).

### Approaches to **Kinship**: (3) the cultural approach (401)

"[[David Schneider]] found that Euro-Americans define relatives both in terms of common 'blood' and by the fact they behave like relatives. In his memorable phrase, kinship involves both natural substance and code for conduct (1968: 29) - though 'natural' is itself a cultural notion of course ... personhood is commonly seen as constituted partly by kinship practices, and party by genetics as locally understood."

"Such accounts are vital because they indicate the means whereby people represent their own actions to themselves and others, but they also have potential pitfalls. First, ethnographic evidence is rarely clear-cut: some South Asians say that substance derives from semen and 'spirit' from uterine blood, but others say substances comes from the ether. Moreover, the sociology of such theories is complex; rival views are often current, and many people have no coherent theory at all. Second, somewhat ironically given the insistence on working through indigenous rather than Western concepts, there is a tendency to write individuals out of the script in favour of abstractions like "Indian thought". Third, it is often implicitly assumed that indigenous explanations have the same purpose as anthropological theories, namely, to provide abstract explanations of social phenomena,."

### Reproductive technology and future kinship (403)

This article began with the premise that biological facts are universal and unchangeable, yet the reproductive technologies now available have the potential to bring about previously unimaginable changes in kinship .... most natural of all notions, motherhood is called into question by the emergence of previously unknown statuses like 'egg-donor' or 'surrogate mother' ... which allows paternity to be unambiguously gendered ... ideas about 'nature' itself which have always been fundamental to cultural notions of kinship, seem bound to change. ([[Marilyn Strathern]] 1992)

### Relatedness (600-601)

This term is part of a comparative endeavour to understand and record the ways in which people in specific ethnographic contexts articulate and engage in the relationships that are important to them in everyday life. 'Relatedness' thus includes not only those bonds classically understood by anthropologists in terms of kinship (in other words, between people linked through actual or putative ties of sexual procreation), but also bonds such as those of **marriage**, **adoption**, and other forms of what has been called 'fictive kinship' by anthropologists. Long-term friendships, ties between coparents-in-law or between former or present partners in gay relationships might be encompassed by relatedness. (600)

Using 'relatedness' instead of, or together with, kinship signals a close attention to the ethnography of everyday life and to the ways that people describe and put into practice the bonds that matter most to them, as well as the processes by which these are made and transformed over time ... a useful device for describing certain kinds of relations that have fallen outside the scope of what anthropologists have conventionally understood as kinship ... ties that are clearly not perceived to derive from sexual procreation but which entail inescapable and long-term debts and obligations that are honoured in ways that are broadly similar to those of kinship. Examples include .... former gay partners in the Bay area of San Francisco described by [[Kath Weston]] (1995) which participants talk about in terms of their enduring qualities and reliability (in marked contrast to their own experiences of family ties). (601)

Because understandings about sexual procreation are culturally inflected or culturally specific ... Schneider therefore recommended the abandonment of kinship as it had been defined within anthropology. (601)

By side-stepping the dichotomy between biological and social relations ... the term relatedness apparently provides a way of suspending the terms of the debate in anthropology about the importance (or not) of sexual procreation. Opening up the study of kinship to ties that might or might not include genealogical links suggests a way to begin from first principles to build up a picture of how people talk about and put into practice the bonds that are important to them, and then to compare such descriptions of different cultures.

The difficulty with relatedness is that it is potentially so broad as to risk being 'analytically vacuous'.

### Reproductive technologies (613-614)

[[Marilyn Strathern]] extends and also critiques David Schneider's account of kinship by arguing that in the level of explicit public and parliamentary debate about NRTs are revealed the workings of ideas of the natural, which are altered by being 'assisted' by technology. Whereas Schneider theorized American kinship systems in terms of symbolic distinction between the order of nature (blood ties) and the order of law (marriage), [[Marilyn Strathern]] uses the context of assisted conception to destabilize this opposition and reveal kinship as the hybrid organization of seemingly distinct domains, such as the individual and society, or **nature and culture**. In turn, she argues, such hybrid effects illustrate the cultural specificity of Euro-American knowledge practices, or ways of making sense. (614)

In tandem with Strathern, the NRTs are understood as a site of cultural production in which established ways of understanding are recombined to new effect. They note that NRTS not only create new persons, but new forms of knowledge and connection.

### Symbolic Anthropology

#### Core symbols and cultural systems (677-678)

In this [[[[American Kinship, a Cultural Account|American Kinship]], Schneider provides a short, highly stylized account of American ideas about kinship, synthesized from interviews with middle-class White residents of Chicago. In this, American ideas about what constitutes a person, about what makes a person a relative, about what makes a person a relative, about blood and sex and biology, nature and law, substance and code, were explored systematically .... it was possible to abstract a 'cultural system' from statements and behaviour and render it in a clear, analytic way which demonstrated that culture was both systematic and autonomous.

Schneider defines a 'cultural system' as 'a system of symbols' and a 'symbol' as simply 'something which stands for something else' (Schneider 1980 [1968] : 1)) ... symbols constitute an autonomous system; within this system, certain symbols are central points of orientation on which all else depends.
