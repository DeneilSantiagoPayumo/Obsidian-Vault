The prologue follows Caili and her child Migmar. Migmar is nude when he is five years old. One year later, he has a strip of cloth to cover his genitals. Later on, he will know shame - of the incest taboo and of desire.

The mother learned about shame that tells every Khumbo that their body is part of a cosmos full of signs and values - for her, a skirt covered by a woolly blanket.

The blood of a Khumbo woman's menses is the sign of the blood she will transmit to her children. Only sperm can create bones and pass on the clan. Every Khumbo woman learns she transmits blood and not bones. If a girl has brothers she has to leave her home - it is the language of the body that tells her what society expects from her.

## THE KHUMBO 90

They are Tibetan speakers living in Nepalese Himalaya. They are made up of twelve scattered settlements. It is the affiliation to the Khumbo community of Sepa as such which grants access to common land.

There has never been any structure of institutionalized central power - informal power is based on uphang - order of the head, which may be glossed as prestige. Power defines the status of 'great people' (mi che che) who determine internal politics. These are religious specialists whose religion is centred upon the local clan.

There is also the external power structure of state administration.

The people of Sepa formed a coherent community - marriage alliances, the creation of common myths, the adjustment to a common ceremony with the worship of clan deities and mountain gods. Religion succeeds in homogenizing a complicated heterogeneity - resulting in the divine order of 'one's own land' and of 'one own people' - developing shared identity in the name of the gods.

For the Khumbo, pre-buddhist conceptions concerning the religious and political dimensions of mountains overlap with Buddhist theories - Sacred mountains are the protector of Buddhist teachings.

## KINSHIP IN SOCIETY AND COSMOS 91

Kinship is conceptualized in terms of 'flesh' and 'bone', categories referring to the components of the human body (Levi-Strauss 1969). Flesh is created by the mother and bones of the father. There are five patrilineal clans referred to as bones whereas matrilineal kin ties are considered ties by blood.

Connection between kinship and flesh and bone ties - parallel cousins are equated to siblings, stressing the closeness of kinship through people of the same gender, distancing those not. The system has an asymmetry (Omaha skewing rule) but flexible to its context: the terms for mother's brother and mother's sister are extended to matrilineal cross-cousins.

These features emphasize the closeness and prestige of the ties with the maternal clan, distancing the 'blood' ties of the father.

Category azhang (mother's brother) defines bride-givers, those who give the women who become mothers. It has a high position, records marriage alliances and more.

The bones of the ancestor make up the 'bone line', a clan name allocates every person to the clan of their father where land is handed down through primogeniture. This makes up male wealth. The ties by blood creates a hybrid category: female goods such as jewellery, clothing and more is transmitted in a female line.

The girl who belongs both to the clan of her father and to the blood of her mother becomes defined by the latter.

Post-nupital patrilocal and neo-patrilocal residence spreads the links by 'blood' throughout the area.

Marriage is monogamous. It prohibits marriage to matrilateral cross-cousins and of women of the same clan and their daughters. You cannot reproduce the marriage of their fathers.

This system is flexible: allowing integration of different groups but without constitution of fixed bride-givers and bride-takers, emphasizing alliance between households. This term is expressed through 'seme' - ancestors of the descendants, favouring the dissolution of larger kin groups within an overall integrating unity.

Institutions other than kinship here take over the integrative function of society.

With the category of azhang, it is the bone tie within the blood which persists over the generations, together with the prestige linked here. Memory of the blood ties remain in the ancestral mothers of the clan.

The male ancestors lose their identity and all ancestors return to the sacred identity.

## The place of kinship within society: descent versus residence 96

Blood ties constitute a latent principle activated according to social context and practice.

For Khumbo women their kin group of origin is a strong but distant support. 20 percent of the Khumbo women reside close to their paternal house. They belong to the groups with whom they reside.

The role of the residential unit is political and can override principles of patrilocality and of patrilineal descent.

...

The political and economic purposes of marriage alliances go beyond kinship though they may be expressed - putting herds, coordinating in agriculture. Household strategies are determined by principles other than kinship and oppose the clan system.

Hildegard (GOAT) compares this with the Kharta. With the Kharta, they are no named clans, no differences between cross and parallel cousins. However bone indicates patrilineal descent and flesh matrilateral kin ties. This comparison suggests that the flesh and bones kinship entails elements that are reshaped throughout Tibetan history.

Women were a means of political alliances between groups and retained a strong tie to their natal group. With the fall of the kingdom and emergence of religious centres, clan and clan names have disappeared. People have been defined by place of birth and residence and religious affiliation - less emphasis on the residential unit.

The introduction of the system of reincarnation allowed the political sphere to transcend kinship for its reproduction with the institution of lines of hierphanies.

Women were less influential here but they enjoyed economic powers as managers of households and autonomy.

## Gender in Tibetan 'flesh and bone' kinship: co-existence and contradictions. 98

Broad interpretations - cognatic, patrilineal aspects, different forms of gender relations. The conceptual oppositions are usually resolved in favour of patrilineality.

The conflict is explained in a myth of the Tibetan Bon religion;

It is the incest taboo and the difference between the mother and sister affirmed in the name of religion which makes her leave and become a daughter-in-law. The legitimation of patrilocality is based on the relative weakness of the ties between the girls and their paternal clan and its deities. The great people are responsible for seeing that this order of kinship is respected. It is this sacred social order that defines the skeleton of society and shapes gender relations.

## GENDER IN KHUMBO SOCIETY 100

There is no distinct female and male worlds: one must specify which women and which men occupy where.

1. Division of labour by gender - differentiation restricted to handicraft (wood-working male and weaving female). The mother is essentially the administrator. Slaughtering is the only exclusively male activity of importance today.
2. Ownership - everything that is not common property is managed by household heads. Land is passed from father to son.
3. Kinship - men have bones and transmit the patrician and women are mobile and bear the impact of marriage alliances. They are the protagonists in the spinning of new marriage alliances.
4. Politics - powerful mothers exert strong influence, its course determined in the houses of the great people. Women are important mediators and women who are great people enjoy flexibility. That said, this is the concern of religious men.
5. Religion - usually men (lama and lhaven) but women perform the role of the lhakama - the oracle, giving voice to dead spirits. It is powerful and stands outside commensality which shape normal social interaction, expressing things of the gods.

Knowledge - religious and ritual knowledge determine the power of male religious specialists. Knowledge of practical calculation, biological and physiological events determine women's power. It usually sees a woman leave her household, become a mother and attain a powerful position.

The more obstacles she has to overcome, the more she is derived as learning from experience.

### What does it mean to be a Khumbo woman? 102

Girls grow up similar to men - passing through roles of daughter, daughter-in-law, oath (position as links of alliances), mother, grandmother, female ancestor, father-mother.

It is the womb that children are conceived, breast are fed. Fathers who are responsible for the human proles inepta - fatherhood is a choice he makes and the woman can leave the child in the forest or to take it home.

Confronted with mothers who lost their children, Khumbo women accept a system that ties fathers to their children - that said, we can have female subordination (priest to accept them into the bones, brothers have right to this land and more).

The daughter-in-law faces work and loses control, whereas the married man chooses to enter this relationship.

Only as a mother and later administrator (not Hildegard's term) does a woman change her power - described as ama of the drongpa, the basic unit of society.

For the Khumbo woman, motherhood, symbolised by her blood, indicates weakness and power.

## THE GENERATION OF A HUMAN BEING: THE HUMAN BODY AS LANGUAGE AND ORDER

### What is a human being, where does it come from and where does it go to?

A baby is considered as made up from the blood of their mother which forms the flesh, the blood and shape; the father creates the bones and brain with sperm. From the soul is the idea of reincarnation.

The Khumbo are born under the protection of mountain deities. They belong to the clans of their fathers, linked to their mothers. Since the maternal substances are transmitted in a cognatic way, there is no female line to belong to - a child is appropriated by interpretation of anatomic elements and physiological processes.

... ritual commensality acts as a cohesive factor for society.
... in opposition to prosperity, shadow with incest. Each event that is 'dip' creates shame.

Reincarnation - personal name is burnt.

### The generation of a human being: sexual relations. 106

In general, sexual relations take place among one's own people and with those that one can share the cup.

Food, sex and alliances are linked. Food (namely fermented *chang*) are protagonists of human and divine link. Marriage is seen as an occasion where one offers food and renews the network of alliances.

Sex is commensality - it satisfies basic needs and is a means of communication. Sex is spoken of in terms of hunger and good taste. Intercourse should satisfy the appetite of both partners - take the time to play with the clitoris. 

The female womb is seen as a red flower that blooms every month and closes if no sperm opens. It is called mendok or kyedok: flower or receptacle of generation.

Breasts are grain that give milk, the food of the baby: it comes from the food the mother eats and from sperm. A young girl is 'like a field' and sperm 'manure' that allows the grain of her breast to grow.

Sex and food are linked to the cosmic interplay of sacred meanings: a cosmos dominated by sexual relations. It presents complementarity and equality between the sexes and also of asymmetry: fecundation does not imply subordination.

.... every mother is considered an emanation of the sashi ama and on the other hand woman is interpreted as a fertile land that gives children and food.

When the khumbo make love, the woman lies below and the man above, or side by side to disguise the act. Women should never step over the body of a man whereas the man sits on his heels in front of her. The time of love reflects an all-pervading above/below opposition that stops people from stepping over anything respected.

### Conception - body interpretation and social affiliation

When a man and woman make love, Khumbo believe they are likely to feel weak. If a man is attentive, he will know about conception - the house of sperm (testicles). From the beginning a father is considered to be physically and emotionally involved in the creation of human life.

Once the sperm has come and flower closed, the sperm needs blood to become bone. Bone produce sperm.

The blood is transmitted cognatically, the blood and vaginal secretions of the mother are produced by the sperm of her father and blood of her own mother. Blood must be combined with sperm to be transmitted, and relations by blood shape its social life.

Due to the position of the bride-giver, her family of origin and her kin group represent strong ties. These relations are perpetuated by her children through their relationship to the mother's brother's household.

To summarise (113): one finds women-to-women relations independent of their respective paternal clans and thus denoting an autonomy of blood relations.

The blood needs the bones to be transmitted and the clan needs the mothers of the clan.

Blood can be used negatively - blood as a negative to bone, the offsprings who can't transmit bones and thus must move away.

In any sense, it legitimizes the rule of patrilocality and the subordinated position of the daughter-in-law.

Life and identity as a Khumbo come to the child with a kind of soul - related to the cycle of rebirth.

The la is used as a synonym for namshe is less precise - the ambivalent category of sol shows how the religious integration of a human being can be rooted in conception of the embryo. The soul links religion, kinship and politics.

### Pregnancy - a critical period for the soul.

The Khumbo term 'sugu nyiba' meaning 'the double body', changing one body to two. It is a time of danger and thus we must 'call the soul' to the clan and mountain deities.

Sexual intercourse continues: food from the ground from the father feeds the mother, the mother feeds the baby from her body.

### Birth - a natural birth in the shadow beyond society. 115

Birth takes place outside the house lest we defile the deities. The father cuts the umbilical cord and makes chicken soup. The mother exists out of contact. The baby is not yet born socially. They are buried in a forest in a hole filled with flowers.

### Name giving - a social birth

We name it, marking the entrance of the new human being into society.

The child's mother is under protection of the husband's clan deity.
A lama purifies the birth dip with dew. We define the parents in relation to their first living child. Everyone is known by the name of their first living child.

Women are more associated to dip than men. They are separated from religion by the virtue of their blood and the bones they can't transmit. Menstruation is a reason to avoid entering the altar area, ritual offerings are performed with the fourth finger. Blood is a symbol for a creative potential.

Dip is the name of the unnameable and the shadow - birth with death. It separates human beings from animals.

### Summary: the human body as language and order for gender identity 118

Gender identity is defined by positions within a kinship system. Control of female fertility is limited to the legitimization of patrilocal rule. Social paternity is indispensable for a child.

This is the context in which the body expresses to the man and woman its message of blood and sperm - male and female bodies carry natural meanings. Blood does not speak nor does it speak of separation of gendered worlds but this is a social world that grants to the brother over his sister the privilege of keeping the paternal land.
