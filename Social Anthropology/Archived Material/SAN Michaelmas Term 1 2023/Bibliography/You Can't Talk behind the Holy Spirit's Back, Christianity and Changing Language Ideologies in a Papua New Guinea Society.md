This chapter begins with the claim that language ideologies stand in complex relationships to ideologies of material exchange. It argues that in Melanesia, contemporary changes in language ideology have been in important respects shaped by transformations in traditional ideologies of exchange. Among the Urapmin of Papua New Guinea, such linked changes have arisen in the wake of conversion to Christianity. Changes in linguistic and exchange ideologies have come to the fore in debates over the practice of charismatic Christian rituals of Holy Spirit possession. This chapter analyzes these rituals and the debates that surround them to show how these transformations have come about.

This essay focuses on how the Urapmin of Papua New Guinea worked to create a new role for speech and a new kind of speaker. The Urapmin figure that speech has no reliable capacity to convey truth and assumed that sincerity was impossible to achieve ... but Protestant linguistic ideology regards speech as an important means for conveying truth and demands.

One place in which these tensions come to a head is through the speech of female Spririt mediums who are held to report things the Holy Spirit has shown or told them, who often call for people to carry out traditional kinds of sacrificial material exchange. This essay will follow why their speech are controversial, why linguistic and material exchanges both serve as analogues of each other and levels of exchange that are in effect competing to do the same work in Urapmin life.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Christianity, cultural change, and the rise of mediumship among the Urapmin

The entire Urapmin community converted to a form of charismatic Protestant Christianity, dismantling their own traditional religion.

The Urapmin continue to contend with a host of nature spirits (motobil) who own all of the natural resources and make people sick. To them, these spirits are evil and they enlist God's support in their effort to be rid of them. One way to see these spirits is to understand them as a persistence of the past that people want to believe have departed from.

The desire to distinguish the present from the past can be seen in how the Urapmin have embraced **Tok Pisin**, regarding it as a language that is connected with the present. It is a modern language and is excessively used in church settings or used as loanwords when urap is spoken in them.

Christianity is to make sincerity desirable and possible, both by fostering a language ideology that promotes and facilitates it and by developing a number of linguistic practices in which such speech can be produced and interpreted.

Spirit women are a class of adult women who can become possessed by the Holy Spirit at will. They are entrusted to be prayed over, and often ask the HS (holy spirit) to discover what is making them sick.

Spirit women shake and speak in tongues as the Holy Spirit speaks in their hearts, and interpret what they have heard and seen for their clients. This phenomenon is new and was introduced by Christianity.

The Urapmin believe the Spirit women to be undeniable truth speakers, to doubt them is tantamount to doubting God himself. Yet, there is a controversy that they are telling falsehoods: lying on the Spirit women's tendency in cases where spirits are thought to threaten a child with death to report that HS recommended prayer and sacrifice of a pig. Since Christ is seen as the last sacrifice, this is a call back to a pre-Christian order.

Some men argue that sacrifice is a sinful practice and these spirit women were possessed by evil spirits. But this was a small trend, and it sputtered out before it had any real influence.

### Spirit women and the relationship between linguistic and material exchange.

The focus on this section is one in which all Urapmin are taking part, involving shifting the ways Urapmin understand linguistic and material exchange to shape social life. This is an important struggle between traditional and Christian ideas where Spirit women work on both sides.

The Urapmin see the move they are making as one of 'social truth', established through ritualized exchange involving material objects to a regime it can be established through speech. Urapmin hold that it is generally impossible to determine a person's intentions by listening to what they say, as too much can happen between the heart. They hold it cannot evidence people's feelings for and cannot make social truth.

Instead, Urapmin turn to the exchange of material goods. "When things are going well, they establish the truth of their mutual involvements by exchanging everyday things like food - things which no adult need from anyone else but of which they almost always give to and get from other people anyway as a way of marking their connection to one another." (131)

People are said to be 'thinking of' each other and material gifts thus can express what words cannot. When things go wrong, people stop giving gifts to each other. Through the conversation of gifts, Urapmin can establish the social truths of their lives but this has changed as demand for sincerity is a cornerstone of Protestant thinking.

The Spirit women have positioned themselves between the social past and present. The truthful status of their speech is rooted in the way the Holy Spirit communicates directly into their heart. This possession shows as how the spoken word taken as sincere can accomplish and establish social truths.

At the same time, the Spirit women link themselves to the past - relating intensively to the nature spirits who represent that past. They relate to the nature spirits who represent that past. It is Spirit women who make the world of the nature spirits a vivid reality for most people - they report on that world and live lives engaged with it.

"Spirit women also remain engaged with the past in the sense that they promote the order of material exchange that formerly completely dominated the production of social truth in Urapmin life." (133). 

The Spirit women's insistence on people returning to the pre-Christian regime of establishing social truth is why they're so controversial, and why some are willing to criticize them despite the risks. That said, outright criticism is rare.

In the Urapmin still willing to sacrifice and that to believe that the Holy Spirit can call for it, they demonstrate the hold on the world of exchange that has its own practices for establishing social truth ... but their inability to shake their ambivalence shows the strength of their determination to move to a Christian regime in which social truth is conveyed by way of speech. (134)

### Spirit women and the analogy between linguistic and material exchange.

Indeed, they occupy a very weird way, enmeshed in a complex project of blending the old and the new. It is the hallmark of systems that use exchange to establish social truth.

Spirit women complicate this distinction between the role of origins in linguistic and exchange ideologies by demanding that people take their speech as true precisely on the basis of its origin in the speech and pictures that the Holy Spirit 'gives' them - they should be trusted because what is reported has a special status.

The Spirit women understand the truthfulness of their own speech to be grounded in an exchange history that looks very much like the ones people track for the material goods they pass between them - once they back their speech with origins, these women open themselves to the belief that it may be evil spirits posing as the HS. "It is an analogic reframing of the truth-value of speech in terms drawn from the ideology of exchange, an ideology that emphasizes where things come from, that leaves the Spirit women vulnerable to the kinds of criticisms they have faced from those made anxious by the way they bring linguistic and material orders into new kinds of relationships." (135)

The truth claiming practice of the Spirit women represent a step on the road to turning Urapmin language ideology in the modern direction as it links the value of speech to its origins. Despite that, there are still tensions.

There are two models of the relationship between language and exchange ideologies - in one, speech and material exchange serves as analogues of each other, in the other linguistic communication and material exchange compete or cooperate with each other to accomplish the same tasks.

In the Urapmin, two models bring out different aspects of current changes - the analogic model points to the Spirit women's appeal to the importance of the origins of speech as part of their efforts to modernize Urapmin language ideology. The model that sees them as competitors bring out the general direction of change in Urapmin, giving linguistic order a prominence in the establishment of social truth it did not have in the past, pinpointing one of the areas of greatest tension in people's efforts to promote speech over material exchange: the practices of Spirit women.
