>Food in an obento is an everyday practice of Japanese life. While its adoption at the nursery school level may seem only natural to Japanese and unremarkable to outsiders, I will argue in this article that the obento is invested with a gendered state ideology. Overseen by the authorities of the nursery school, an institution which is linked to, if not directly monitored by, the state, the practice of the obento situates the producer as a woman and mother, and the consumer, as a child of a mother and a student of a school. Food in this context is neither casual nor arbitrary. Eaten quickly in its entirety by the student, the obento must be fashioned by the mother so as to expedite this chore for the child. Both mother and child are being watched, judged, and constructed; and it is only through their joint effort that the goal can be accomplished.

>I use [[Althusser]]'s concept of the Ideological State Apparatus (1971) to frame my argument. I will briefly describe how food is coded as a cultural and aesthetic apparatus in Japan, and what authority the state holds over schools in Japanese society. Thus situating the parameters within which the obento is regulated and structured in the nursery school setting. I will examine the practice both of making and eating obento within the context of one nursery school in Tokyo.

>I conclude that obentos as a routine, task, and art form of nursery school culture are endowed with ideological and gendered meanings that the state indirectly manipulates. The manipulation is neither total nor totally coercive, however, and I argue that pleasure and creativity for both mother and child are also products of the obento.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Cultural Ritual and State Ideology

How we see reality, in other words, is also how we live it. So the conventions by which we recognize our universe are also those by which each of us assumes our place and behaviour within that universe. Culture is, in this sense, doubly constructive: constructing both the world for people and people for specific worlds.

The author describes Althusser conceptions of the ISA - the Ideological State Apparatus. The power of ideology here is more far-reaching and insidious than the SA's power of coercion. This world of commodities is seen as a naturalised environment, as we live to accept it.

Mothers often worry about making good bentos for their children - there is a central question here. Why is a small child with limited appetite and scant interest in food so elaborately prepared?

Presentational style is the guiding principle by which food is prepared in Japan - one code is smallness, separation and fragmentation:
	"Visually, food substances are presented according to a structural principle not only of segmentation but also of opposition ... the container is as important as what is contained in Japanese cuisine, but it is really how the containment that is stressed, that is, how food has been reconstructed and rearranged from nature to appear, in both beauty and freshness, perfectly natural." (197)

The naturalization of food is rendered through two devices - one by hinting at and appropriating the nature that comes from outside, decorating food with seasonal reminders. The first is to "accentuate and perfect the preparation process to such an extent that the food appears not only to be natural, but more nearly perfect than nature without human intervention ever could be. This is nature made artificial." (197)

This thus lends Japanese food its potential for cultural and ideological manipulation. The first order of language (language-object) is emptied of its original meaning and converted into an empty form to take another order of signification ("metalanguage" or "second-order semiological system").

"Embedded within this insistence on eating Japanese food, thereby reconfirming one as a member of the culture, are the principles by which Japanese food is customarily prepared: perfection, labour, small distinguishable parts, opposing segments, beauty and the stamp of nature." (198)

Two principles:
1. There is an order to the food, right way to do things
2. The one who prepares the food takes on the responsibility of producing food to the standards of perfection and exactness that Japanese cuisine demands.

### Rituals and Routines

Rituals and routines surrounding the bento underly a third order, manipulation - expressing cultural behaviours. "State-guided schools borrow this coded apparatus: using the natural convenience and cover of food not only to code a cultural order but also to socialize children and mothers into the gendered roles and subjectivities they are expected to assume." (198)

Schools help reproduce social boundaries. Knowledge is socially constructed and differentially acquired according to who is or will be in society, depending on the convergence of different interests desired or the power any interest has in exerting desires for subjects. Here, the Ministry of Education decides it thus: every public school follows the same curriculum, adheres to the same structure and so on.

In Japanese Nursery schools, children rather learn more about how to become a Japanese student and this formula - Japanese and student - are equally stressed.

The state has influence in several ways:  (199)
1. First, authority over how the *yochien* is run is in the hands of the Ministry of Education.
2. Second, most parents and teachers see the *yochien* as the first step to the system of compulsory education that starts in the first grade and is closely controlled by the Monbusho.
3. Third, the rules and patterns of "group living", a Japanese social iedal that is reiterated nationwide ... is first introduced to teh child in nursery school.

Since nursery school is a very transitional moment in a child's life, the obento is intended to allow a child's mother to manufacture something of herself and allow them to transition. By producing something from the home, the mother goads her child to face what is inevitable, giving of herself and the home to the child.

### Gender Norms

The obento is filled with the meaning of mother and homes in several ways:
**Sheer labour** - women spend what seems to be an inordinate amount of time on this. They discuss obento ideas, spend 20-45 minutes assembling an obento and more. For this, such labour is a sign of a woman's commitment as a mother and her inspiring her child to being similarly committed as a student. "The obento is thus a representation of what the mother is and what the child should become." (200)

All obentos must be eaten. Though it is not an easily realized rule in schools, the logic is that children must meet expectations, introducing and indoctrinating children into the patterns of Japanese education.

Yochien obentos are designed to be pleasing and personal, and are designed to be a test for the child. A structure filled with an image of the mother is emptied to write of the ideological demands of being a member of Japanese culture. 

Teachers check over obentos, make sure the food is consumed, scolding children who take too long. It is the teacher whose role is it to judge the person eating the food, covering both the student and the mother. The child's job is to eat the food and the mother's to eat it. The responsibility and execution of one's task is not only shared but conditioned by the other.

The author describes her child David who was attending this school. His behaviour was disruptive, he hit the child, was loud and was insecure. However, the principal decided to discuss the obentos instead.

The author deems another message - an injunction to follow directions, obey rules, and accept the authority of the school system. This was inculcated through certain rituals - walking in line, brushing his teeth after eating, arriving at school early and more. Her American child had to become Japanese.

The nursery school differentiates between the child who does and does not manage the rituals of nursery school - the student will conform.


The process of production within the home organises different ideological packages for the mother - the mother is faced with different expectations in the preparation of the obento than the child.

The author describes the aestheticization of the obento - aesthetic categories and codes that operate generally for Japanese cuisine are applied to the nursery school format. Even children don't care too much about the style or aesthetic nature of food.

The first factor:
"Just as the obento is meant as a device to assist a child in the struggles of first adjusting to school, the mother's role generally is perceived as being the support, goad, and cushion for the child ... if the child succeeds, a mother is complimented; if the child fails, a mother is blamed." (203)

The second factor: (203)
"A woman's devotion to over-elaborating her child's lunchbox is that her experience doing this becomes part of her and a statement."
"An obento therefore is not only a gift or test for a child but a representation and product of the woman herself."

Women are judged by the teacher and each other. The making of this is a double-edged sword - by relishing its creation a woman is ensconcing herself in the ritualization and subjectivity of being a mother in Japan. She is alienated in the sense that others will dictate her work. Through this, it is how the woman expresses, identifies and constitutes herself.

What is consistent in Japanese cooking is manipulation and order: food is manipulated into some other form than it normally assumes, and is ordered by some human rather than natural principle; everything must have neat boundaries and be placed so those boundaries do not merge.

"Overarching all is the potential to aestheticize a certain social order, a social order which is coded ... as Japanese." ... "The obento's message is that the world is constructed very precisely and that the role of any single Japanese in that world must be carried out with the same degree of precision." (205)

Women are expected to do this, and are the tie of the ideological support that this food obtains. 

"Motherhood is state ideology, working through children at home and at school and through such mother-imprinted labour that a child carries from home to school as with the obento." (205)
