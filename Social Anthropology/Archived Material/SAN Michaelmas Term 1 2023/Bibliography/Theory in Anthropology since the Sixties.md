[[Practice Theory and Marxism]] - 371 - 405

372

I will argue that a new key symbol of theoretical orientation is emerging, which may be labelled as "practice". It is not a theory or a method but a symbol in the name of which a variety of theories and methods are being developed.

373

This essay will be concerned with the relations between various theoretical schools or approaches, both within periods of time and across time.

## The Sixties: Symbol, Nature, Structure

The author chooses to start at the 1960s. That is when she had started, and she wants to unite theory and practice from the outset.

There was a major set of revolutions in theory beginning in the early sixties where Marxist theory and reception aesthetics had begun to replace the older moral humanism.

In Anthropology, the kit consisted of three major paradigms: British structural-functionalism (from [[Radcliffe-Brown]] and [[Malinowksi]]), American cultural and psychological anthropology (from [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]) and American evolutionist anthropology (from [[Leslie White[[]] and [[Julian Steward]])

374

Around this time, certain mentors and actors were trained in this area.

### Symbolic Anthropology

It was an umbrella term for a number of different trends invented by [[Clifford Geertz]] and [[Victor Turner]]. The former was influenced by [[Max Weber]] and the latter by [[Emile Durkheim]].

Geertz's most radical move was to argue that culture isn't just locked in people's heads but is embodied in public symbols, symbols through which the members of a society communicate their worldview to another. It gives this concept of culture a degree of objectivity.

Symbols are a vehicle for meaning and the study of symbols themselves were never an end in itself - Geertzians were never interested in distinguishing and cataloguing the varieties of symbolic types or are they interested in the ways in which symbols perform certain practical operations in the social process.

375

For him, the most important part of anthropology was determining how symbols shape the way actors see, feel and think about the world.

It is worth noting that Geertz has been more interested in the ethos of culture than the worldview - for Geertz, he has been interested in how the Balinese way of chopping up time stamps their sense of self, of social relations and of conduct - their ethos.

He must insist that we study culture "from the actor's point of view" - culture is a product of acting social beings trying to make sense of the world in which they find themselves. Culture is not an abstractly ordered system, its logic derives from logic or organization of action, from people operating within certain institutional orders, interpreting their situations in order to act coherently within them. Geertz didn't develop a theory of action, all he did was plant the actor at the centre of his model.

[[David Schneider]] was concentrated on refining the culture concept, his efforts went towards understanding the internal logic of systems by a notion of 'core symbols' and 'cultural systems.

376

Then, the author discusses [[Victor Turner]] who stressed that society was formed of conflict and contradiction - it was not how solidarity was fine-tuned but rather how it was constructed and maintained.

For Turner, symbols are of interest not vehicles of culture that might, when put into certain arrangements, produce social transformation. Thus symbols in Ndembu curing or initiation are investigated for ways in which they move actors from one status or another.

These Turnerians added a British dimension to the field of symbolic anthropology, investigating in detail the effectiveness of symbols, the question of how symbols do what people claim them to do: act as active forces.

People say symbolic anthropology is literary and unscientific. Here, the author points at the lack of systematic sociology: its underdeveloped sense of politics of culture.

## Cultural Ecology

Its roots go back to [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and back to [[E. B. Tylor]] and ultimate back to [[Karl Marx]].

377

Observable symbols was the key to the liberation of symbolic anthropology from cultural anthropology - Geertz has trumpeted that the study of culture embodied in symbols removed the problem of getting into people's heads [[Sahlins]] embodied the focus on adaptation to environmental factors.

378

The Sahlins and Service version of cultural ecology was fundamentally evolutionist - the use of the adaptation concept was in explaining the development, maintenance and transformation of social forms. Cultural ecology came to dominate the materialist wing in the sixties - expressed by [[Marvin Harris]] and [[Roy Rappaport]]: it shifted the focus away from evolution and toward explaining the existence of particular bits of particular cultures.

The sacredness of cows protects the agricultural food chain, for example: the interest has shifted from how the environment stimulates the development of socioeconomic forms to the question of the ways in which social and cultural forms function to maintain an existing relationship with the environment.

379

The cultural ecologist considered symbolic anthropologists to be fuzzy-headed mentalist. Symbolic anthropologists considered cultural ecology to be sterile.

From the point of view of British social anthropology, the American struggle was meaningless - the central term of all proper anthropological discussion was society.

## Structuralism

Structuralism, produced by [[Claude Levi-Strauss]] was a new paradigm.

380

He suggested that the bewildering variety of social and cultural phenomena could be rendered intelligible. He sought to establish the universal grammar of culture and the ways in which units of cultural discourse are created, the rules of which units are arranged and combined to produce the actual cultural production. Cultures are herein systems of classification.

In practice, structural analysis consists of sifting out the basic sets of oppositions that underlie some complex cultural phenomenon and showing the ways in which the phenomenon in an expression of those contrasts and a reworking of them.

This methods allows the ordering of data both on a vast scale and in terms of explicating myriad tiny details from them - why honey metaphors are used to describe the escape of game animals, or why the jaguar covers his mouth when he laughs.

He grounds the structures he discerns beneath society and culture in the structure of the mind. It seems incontrovertible that all humans and all cultures classify.

The enduring contribution lies in the perception that luxuriant variety has a deeper unity and systematicity derived from the operation of a small number of underlying principles.

381

In here he claims affinity with Marx and Freud, who argue that beneath the surface proliferation of forms, a few uniform mechanisms are operating. This allows us to distinguish clearly between simple transformations and a real revolution.

Structuralism was not popular among American anthropologists - seen at first as symbolic anthropology, its central assumptions were distant however from that. There were a number of reasons: the cognitive emphasis of Levi-Strauss's notion of meaning versus American's interest in ethos and values, Levi-Strauss' austere emphasis on the arbitrariness of meaning (all meaning is established by contrasts) and against the American's interest in relations between the forms of symbolic constructs and the contents for which they are vehicles, the explicitly abstract locus of structures divorced in ever way from the actions and intentions of actors. For all of these reasons, Structuralism was not embraced by American symbolic anthropologists - it was granted what might be fictive kinship status because of its tendency to focus on the domains that symbolic anthropologists took as their own.

British anthropologists applied structural analysis to particular societies and cosmologies, focusing on the mediation of oppositions and producing ruminations upon anomaly and antistructure.

382

The British purged structuralism of its radical features - the eradication of the Durkheimian distinction between the social 'base' and cultural 'reflection' of it, claiming that if mythic structures paralleled social structures, it is because myth and social organization shared a common underlying structure. Many structuralists went to the position, considering myth and ritual as reflecting at the symbolic level oppositions taken to be fundamentally social. It could fit in British anthropology without having a profound effect on it.

Marxists observed.

## The Seventies: Marx

In US and France, radical social movements emerged: counterculture, anti-war movement, then the women's movement. Everything was criticised. For instance, the earliest critiques took the form of denouncing the historical links between anthropology on one hand and colonialism and imperialism on the other (Asad).

383

There was a rallying symbol of new criticism was Marx. There was two distinct schools of thought: structural Marxism and political economy.

## Structural Marxism

Within it, Marx was used to attack every theoretical scheme on the landscape. Structural Marxism constituted a would-be total intellectual revolution, shaking up the movement.

The advance of structural Marxism lay in locating the determinative forces not in the natural environment but specifically within certain structures of social relations.

384

Cultural ecology was attacked as 'vulgar materialism' reinforcing rather than undoing the classical capitalist fetishization of things, the domination of subjects by objects and symbolized by those objects.

Structural Marxists turned their attention to cultural phenomena - culture here was converted to ideology and considered from the point of its view in social reproduction.

One of its virtues was that there was a place for everything in its schemes. Its practitioners established a model in which the two levels are related to one another via a core of social/political/economic processes.

Structural Marxists put a powerful sociology back into the picture, fertilizing British social anthropological categories and producing an expanded model of social organizations. They paid attention to kinship, descent, marriage, exchange, domestic organization and the like.

385

This has a number of problems: the narrowing of cultural concept to ideology was too extreme and related ideology back to the more general conception of culture. Seeing culture in terms of mystification gave cultural studies a functionalist favour. Additionally, although structural Marxists offered a way of mediating the material and ideological levels, they did not challenge the notion that such levels are analytically distinguishable in the first place: they merely offered a deeper and objective base. Really, they reproduced the idea that it is useful to maintain a set of analytic boxes.

## Political Economy

The political economy school took its inspiration from world-systems and underdevelopment theories in political sociology. The political economists here have shifted the focus to large-scale regional and political systems, their research taking the form of studying the effects of capitalist penetration upon these communities.

386

Their focus was mainly on the impact of external forces and on the ways in which societies change or evolve largely in adaptation to such impact, tying the political economy school in certain ways to the cultural ecology of the sixties. The important external forces were those of the natural environments.

At the level of theory, political economists differ from their cultural ecology forebears partly in showing a greater willingness to incorporate cultural or symbolic issues into their inquiries.

They differ from their cultural ecology forebears because they show a greater willingness to incorporate cultural or symbolic issues into their inquiries - their work tending to focus on symbols involved in the development of class or group identities. The political economy school overlaps with ethnicity industry

Anthropologists have a tendency to treat societies as though there were islands unto themselves, with little sense of the larger systems of relations in which these units were embedded, ignoring the fact that peasants are part of states and that even primitive societies are involved in wider systems in exchanges of all sorts, distorting the data. In here, political economists remind us of this.

Political economists are also important for stressing the importance of history for anthropological study.

387

The main objection is located deeper in the theoretical model of political economy - the capitalism-centred view of the world is questionable. At the core of the model is the assumption that everything we have touched has been corrupted by capitalism and thus everything in monographs would've developed in response to that system. When we get even further from the 'centre'... is this really true?

This allow affects the political economists' view of history - history is treated as something that arrives. Thus we do not get the history of that society, but the impact of our history on that society - the accounts produced are unsatisfactory. Traditional studies have their own problems with respect to history, presenting us with a thin chapter on historical background and an inadequate one. Political economy inverts this relation.

They situate themselves on the ship of capitalist history, saying we don't know what the other system looks like anyway. To such a position we can only respond that we must try and understand other systems from the ground level. It is the only basis of anthropology's distinctive contribution to the human sciences - our capacity to take the perspective of the folks on the shore.

## Into the eighties: Practice

For the past several years, there has been growing interest in analysis focused through one or another of a bundle of interrelated terms: practice, praxis, action, interaction, activity, experience, performance. A second term focuses on the doer: agent, actor, person, self, individual, subject.

For much of the seventies, structural Marxists and political economists remained dominant - for social and cultural phenomena are explained largely by being referred to systemic / structural mechanisms of one sort to another.

![[Pasted image 20231029132505.png]]

390

The practice approach is diverse. We will select a number of works.

We can contrast newer practice-orientated work with certain established approaches, especially with symbolic interactionism in sociology and with what was called transactionalism in anthropology. The first point is that these approaches were elaborated in opposition to Parsonian/Durkheimian view of the world as of rules and norms.

Newer practice theories share a view that the system has powerful effect upon human action. Their interest in the study of action and interaction expresses an urgent need to understand where the system comes from - how it is produced and reproduced.

The other major aspect differentiates it significantly from interactionist and transactionalist approaches.

391

This is visible in which things like culture and structure are viewed - newer practice theorists share with sixties a strong sense of the shaping power of culture/structure, viewed as 'constraint' and 'hegemony' and 'symbolic domination.' The Marxist influence is seen in the assumption that most important forms of action or interaction are those that take place in asymmetrical or dominated relations, these forms of action or interaction explain the shape of any given system.

Rather, this is an interpenetration between Marxist and Weberian framework: materialist and idealists. Actor is the centre of [[Max Weber]]'s model and these writers emphasize issues of human praxis in Marx - encompass economic exploitation within political domination.

### What Is Being Explained?

392

Modern practice theory seeks to explain the relationship that obtain between human action, on the one hand, and some global entity which we may call "the system".

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Sahlins]] takes a French structuralist view of the system - both Bourdieu's *habitus* and Sahlin's "cosmological dramas" behave in many ways like the American concept of culture, combining elements of ethos, affect and value with cognitive schemes of classification. The point is that practice anthropologists assume that society and history are governed by organizational and evaluative schemes. It is these that constitute the system.

The system is not broken up into units like base and superstructure but a seamless whole. An institution is at once a system of social relations, economic arrangements, political processes, cultural categories, norms, values, emotional patterns and so on. No attempt is made to sort these components into levels and to assign primacy to one or the other level. A practice approach has no need to break the system into artificial chunks but rather to explain the system as an integral whole.

That said, there are realities of asymmetry, not all dimensions have equal significance.

393

What practice theory explains is the reproduction and change of form.

### What is Practice?

The answer to this question is almost unlimited. The most significant forms of practice are those with intentional or unintentional political implications.

Beyond this point, distinctions may be introduced - for instance, the question of what is taken to be the acting units. Most practice anthropologists take these units to be individual actors or social types.

The analysts take these people and their doings as the reference point for understanding a particular unfolding of events and for understanding the processes involved in the reproduction or change of some set of structural features.

394

A second set of questions concern the temporal organization of actions. Those like Bourdieu treat action as 'moves', acting in plans and programs that are only intelligible only within the context of those larger plans. Many plans are culturally provided but many are constructed by actors themselves. The emphasis on projects than moves underlines the point that action itself has structure, operating in, and in relation to structure.

Finally, there is the question of the kind of action taken to be analytically central - people oppose Parsonian or Saussurian view in which action is an execution of rules and norms. People agree that a romantic voluntarism will not do. Then there is a view of action largely in terms of pragmatic choice. It is precisely in those areas of life - domestic domain - where action proceeds with little reflection either because practice wants to emphasize the activeness and intentionality of action or because of a growing interest in change as against reproduction, or both.

### What Motivates Action?

A theory of practice requires a theory of motivation - derived from interest theory currently. The model is of an individualistic, aggressive actor, self-interested, rational and maximizing. What actors do is rationally go after what they want, and what is materially and politically useful for them.

Interest theory is clearly too narrow - pragmatic rationality is only one aspect of motivation.

But... this is hard to handle methodologically.

395

If interest theory assumes too much rationality on the part of actors, it assumes too much activeness - the idea that actors are pressing claims and whatnot may be too energetic. We may recall here the distinction by Geertz between interest theory and strain theory, if actors in interest theory are striving for gains, those in strain theory are seen as experiencing the complexities of their situations.

Strain theory makes for a certainly systematic exploration of social forces shaping motives than interest theory does.

396

Finally, an interest approach tend to go hand in hand with seeing action in terms of short-term tactical moves than long-term development projects. From a tactical point of view, actors seek gains whereas from a development point of view, actors are involved in the transformations of their states of being.

### The Nature of Interactions between Practice and the System

**How does the system shape practice?

The emphasis shifted from what culture allows and enables people to see, feel and do to what it restricts them. It is agreed upon that culture constitutes the reality that actors live in, but why this one and not other?

397

Domination operates by shaping actors dispositions in the extreme case.

These authors who emphasize cultural domination put limits on the depth of cultural controls. The extreme case is never reached, they argue that hegemony is fragile and not total.

398

**How does practice shape the system?**

Beginning with reproduction, newer practice place emphasis on the ordinary practices of ordinary living - little routines, eating, sleeping and relaxing. These routines are predicated upon and embody etiquette. In enacting this, actors must be shaped and repeatedly endorse those principles in the world of public observation and discourse. 

One question lurking: does all practice embody and reproduces the assumptions of the system? If actors are fully cultural beings, they could ever do anything that does not carry forward core cultural assumptions.

399

These two formulations are grounded in two models: the classic Marxist model where asymmetries of political relations create counterculture and change comes with class struggle.

But briefly, this model overstates the differences of conceptual orientations between classes and entities: class differences are not historically cultural differences, not within culturally homogenous systems.

[[Sahlins]]'s model - people in different social positions have different interests and they act accordingly. This does not imply conflict or struggle: only that they will seek to enhance their respective position when opportunities arise. Change comes about when traditional strategies assume traditional patterns of relations are deployed in relation to novel phenomena.

400

This is appealing: he does not equate divergence of interest with countercultural formation and is not forced to see change in actual replacement of groups. His model also unites mechanisms of reproduction and transformation. Change is failed reproduction and if changes in meaning is revolutionary, revolution itself less extraordinary.

He still struggle with the interest perspective and does not fully grapple with it.

He makes change appear too easy - only in passing. Sahlins notes only in passing the mechanisms that hold a system in place. The move to maintain the status quo by those who have vested interests may backfire and produce unintended results.

Too much systematic reproduction takes place via routinized activities and interactions of domestic life - to a degree that domestic life is insulated is not covered and the transmission of novel meanings may be hindered.

There is a lot of linkage and slippage than Sahlin's smooth account.

401

Two points: the centrality of domination, patterns of cooperation and reciprocity and solidarity constitute the other side of the coin of human being. That said, to penetrate into the workings of asymmetrical social relations is to penetrate to the heart.

The second point, major social change does not account for change that comes about as intended course of action: change is largely an unintended consequence of action.

### Conclusion and Prospect

Two wings: the political economy, to understand changes in small-scale domination and ethnographic sort of historical investigation.

403

History is not something that happens to people but something they make within the constraints of the system wherein they operate. A practice approach attempts to see this making whether in the past or the present, the creation of novelty or in the reproduction of the old thing: a model that unifies both historical and anthropological studies.
