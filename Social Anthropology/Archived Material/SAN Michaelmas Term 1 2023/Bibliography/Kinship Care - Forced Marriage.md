For Mody, kinship is a space of care as a space in which contraint, coercion and choice mutually inform and interact with each other as a sort of working-out of kinship relations.

## Kinship Care - Forced Marriage
### **A collection of key ideas**

#### State Care Versus Kinship Care in 'Forced Marriage'

Legal conception of forced marriage:
- No full concept
- Active desire of a community to sustain marriages - British South Asian
- Governments in the UK base policy responses to forced marriage on an idea to modernise minority communities based on a concept of cultural othering

Here, Mody provides the idea of [[Simeran Gell]] (1994):
- Transformation in marriage amongst British South Asians related to how communities have sought to internalise the complex experience of immigration in their new motherland
- Two marriage sequence: British South Asian enacted the experience of earlier generations, married putative strangers
- 1990s in Bedford - Registry marriage in 'English style' and a religious marriage in a community space with 'Indian style' of dress: the former as an attempt to 'smile at the state', allowing their alien cultural forms to be audited.

Increasing levels of honour killing:
- Increasing number of regulation (Forced Marriage Act 2007) and exit or dialogue.
- Increasing demand for public support against multiculturalism.
- Cultural othering in response.

Problems:
* "Anthropologists studying the law and responding to the UK government's consultation prior to criminalisation sought to locate these marriages within the wider context and argued that criminalisation would do nothing short of destroying those that were so activated."
- "My own ethnographic research with those who had experienced 'forced marriages' ... confirmed this picture ... young people I worked with choosing to bring the fact of the 'forced marriage' to the attention of the authorities for fear of making a difficult situation with their families far worse." (190)
- Informants characterise care are the friends, family members and British South Asian NGOs who provide empathy, advice, counselling and support - not those of the Forced Marriage Unit, 'proceedings' and not 'care.'
- Informants were less able to cut off families and lose their support network - in so creating pockets of care
#### Meanings of care that is not evident

Why study forced marriages?
- Allows us to better see the ways in which these marriages sit within the ebb and flow of intergenerational familial relations that are utterly transformed and reshaped as an outcome of 'forced marriage' which has become 'kinship events' with kinship and caring consequences. (198)
- "Kin-making ... as a process that continues over time and is closely tied with intersubjective relations between those involved."
- Kinship care - with Farida and Kayva, uncomfortable compromises that make kinship care, showing how informants have created space of refuge and care through the uncertainty and confusion raised by frequently loving acts of one sort or another that they recognise as coercive. Spaces of care emerge from there, an account of care as an act of kinship.
- Transformation of relationships that are dynamic.

Farida:
- Forced into a marriage with a man form Pakistan
- In exchange for the damage the parents have done to her life, her parents provide for her: they bought her a flat close to their home so they can help out.
- A trade-off: a social pretence that means she plays the part of a good wife but she ios allowed freedom, spending money and childcare.
- Very little interest in taking the marriage to the police - everyone knew it - she continued to take redress from her parents.
- She characterised childcare and saw no role to reciprocate any care towards them other than remaining independent.
- "Much as the state sought to protect, Farida preferred direct action and continuing dependence by extracting kinship obligations that she demanded from her parents as a right."

Kayva:
- Left forced marriage - in refuge. Very abusive relationship, sired children.
- Had a close friend, a woman named Mariam who was essentially her daughter. Her name was Mariam. They shared information, called each other, spoke to each other everyday.
- Fallen out - Mariam dated a close friend of Kayva and she was felt used.
- Withholding of care through distance and inattentiveness, absence of presence and care.
- She sought out her family to provide her and her children with the kinship support system - the 'family she chose'. 
- Networks of care ere taken away - children gone because her husband alleged that she wouldn't be able to take care of them.
- Her grandfather demanded that no one would arrange marriages anytime.
- Kayva's father was served a marriage notice by Kayva's younger sister abruptly - he was threatened.
- Kayva's experience should never be repeated.
- "Kayva sees that she must help her own children to understand their past and that her own kinship care consists of ensuring that they understand what happened to their mother within the context of the context of their own affections for their grandparents ... individual also sits on a continuum of regulation between a socialising community ... and the state with its laws."
