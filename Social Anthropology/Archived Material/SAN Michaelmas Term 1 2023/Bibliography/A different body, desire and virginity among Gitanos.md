This article deals with the GItanos (Spanish Gypsies) in Madrid.

The extent to which biological sex differences determines cultural constructs has traditionally been one of the key analytical dilemmas in the anthropology of gender. Some argue human bodies must require interpretation, or that although gender was not determined by biology it was the elaboration of biological sex difference.

[[Yanagisako and Collier]] suggest that to move forwards in the debate, we should focus on how relations between men and women are viewed and organized in particular contexts without assuming that they are structured through difference - we should cover the social and cultural processes that cause men and women to appear different from each other.

[[Judith Butler]] insists on conceiving gender not only as a cultural inscription on sex but as an apparatus of production whereby the sexes are established.

This awareness poses problems for anthropologists who want to link their analyses of culture and discourse to social relations and materiality - its de-stabilisation can threaten the aim of the body and biological reproduction as fundamental points of reference.

This ethnography illustrates the Gitanos of Jarana, the neighbourhood of Madrid who emphasize a fixed heterosexual differentiation. Gitanos assert the existence of the *honra*, a tangible feature located inside the vagina that is pivotal to Gitano identity. The Gitano case makes it necessary to take account of the physical aspect of the processes through which gender is culturally constructed, as well as the cultural specificity of sex itself.
## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Sex and personhood in Jarana

The Gitanos of Jarana think of people as gendered and sexed: either *mujeres* or *hombres*. The distinction between women and men is portrayed as given, fixed and unquestionable - men and women stress that women are more evil and have less capacity for understanding and deserve less respect from others.

These bodily features combine with non-bodily elements to make the categories of *woman* and *man*.

Gitanos do not separate an understanding of sex from an understanding of gender, and the type of genitals individuals have points to the positions they can take throughout their lives.

They use modern medical technology to determine the sex of a child - men are thought to be better than woman and thus boys are tended to be preferred over girls. These attitudes encourage them to be proud of their genitals and develop a self-identity in which genitals occupy a central place.

The words that define the genitals - *pija* (penis) and *chocho* (internal and external female genitalia) can be defined as neutral in that they don't carry polite or rude connotations. They are loving terms of address to children and can become nicknames. They stand for male or female children in a metonymic way.

Boys' genitals are particularly celebrated - mothers love playing with their young sons' penises.

"Through the management of the male and female body in daily life, the categories *mujer* and *hombre* are phrased as relational and hierarchical, and come to be involved in unequal relations from the very moment of birth. That is, they have clear social and cultural bearings, rather than being restricted to the mere - or 'neutral' - identification of given differences." (522)

In regards to sexual intercourse, the Gitanos view sexual desire as part of the make-up of male and female persons, portraying intercourse as enjoyable for both and coveted. It seems to be the body that appears as the subject that enjoys sexual activity - "may your body enjoy it", "my clam (vulva) is itching", "she loses her ass after him". Much joking takes place between family that emphasise this sexual libido.

Gitano morality puts great stress on control. This emphasis revolves around a dual moral standard: women should dominate their wishes much more than men, they should remain virgins until marriage and always be faithful. On the other hand, men improve their social standing by demonstrating that they are active sexually.

Male sexual is celebrated during *mocedad*, the period in life between childhood and marriage - they associate sexual desire with the lack of self-control, acquired with age and increasing wisdom. 

Women enhance their status by simultaneously displaying sexual continence - in childhood, girls are dressed in trousers and miniskirts as their sexual morality is not significant. With the transition to *mocedad*, the way women sit, walk and bear themselves becomes an embodiment of their moral worth. Gitanas should be inconspicuous, cover their thighs and pull their skirts forwards. Women who are too conspicuous are accused of wanting to have sex. 

The Gitanos link marriage with a loss of virginity - a woman should marry the man who first has sex with her, for whom she is deflowered at the wedding ceremony. A woman who loses her virginity is no longer treated as a *moza* (an unmarried women), and loses the respect of Gitano community and becomes an object of scorn. 

### The female body

Among the Gitanos of Jarana, virginity depends on several elements, all of which can be discerned from their genitals. Women can describe to us how old Gitanas can tell if a girl is open or whole, whether full intercourse has taken place or she was been rubbed or pecked.

```ad-example
In young girls, the area surrounding the entry to the vagina is believed to be pink and glossy, and to turn dark - brown, grey or black - with the contact of the penis and other objects such as trousers or tampons. As they become older the genitals of women are though to turn 'harder'.... (525)

Inside a virgin woman there exists a *uva*, a white or greyish hard grain the size of a chick-pea that contains her *honra*. This yellow fluid is spilt and deflowered when penetrated by a man or deflowered by a professional woman. These doctors don't care about the hymen - flesh that makes the entrance to the vagina tight.

It's existence is proof of her identity - women are expected to protect their genital virginity and not ruin her 'proof of decency.' The wedding ceremony is structured around the celebration of the virginity of the bride. After the *ajuntamiento* where the woman is deflowered by a professional doctor, the Gitanos celebrate - clapping with joy, singing and more. Male relatives dance and toss the bride.

Gitanos believe that since courting couples will experience sexual desire, they approve of sexual contact as long as it is in the waist upwards - couples who exceed this are felt to be wanting in self control. Eloping is perceived as lacking restraint and the life it leads is viewed negatively.

```ad-seealso
title: Gender double standards (528-529)
Gitanos often state that a boy who tries to get as much as he can from his girlfriend is simply behaving accoridng to his disposition. Boys do not need to keep their affairs secret as girls do, and their families very often know which girl or girls a boy is courting.

Simulatenously, however, the ideal for a man is to marry a woman for whom he is her first boyfriend.

In the case of women, it reflects negatively to be engaged more than once.

When women's behaviour is evaluated, their readiness - even eagerness - to engage in sexual relations is condemned and interpreted as a failure to conform to proper Gitano standards.

Girls can lie to ther boyfriend, making him believe that he is the first man with wom she had sexual relations and so forcing him to elope with her when he is in fact 'covering the hole made by someone else.'

In reality Spanish doctors don't believe in the existence of the Honra. That's because they don't have a conceptual dichotomy of gender and sex - this fact is central to how they experience their bodies, personhood and identity.

Instead we should view experience - what characteristics of the body people imagine and how it relates to other practices, and where its meanings come from. Gitano ideas about the genitals are loaded with understandings about what people belonging to categories are more important - the honra is a powerful example, "it shows how behaviour, status and worth are collapsed into a tangible bodily element which works metonymically" (530)

The body is only accessed within a cultural framework. In reality, the *honra* may be the Bartholin's Glands - agents that lubricate the vagina during intercourse. Neither these two correspond to the obvious facts of biological sex difference.

The key question to ask is - which bodies come to matter, and why?

For the GItanos, a woman is a woman because she has the *honra* inside her body, a constitutive construction. These elements have obtained the character that we don't think about at all.
