>These “sugar daddy” relationships , as discussed by Bongani and his father, are an example of the widespread link between gifts and sex that this article examines. These type of relations fall outside of both local and Western definitions of “prostitution” — the usual focus of studies on the materiality of non-marital sex and a frequent explanatory factor for the rapid spread of AIDS. Indeed, while prostitution is one important factor driving HIV infection, it cannot explain the tremendous speed and persistence with which the virus has spread in South Africa. Prostitution may well have propelled HIV quicky through the major migrancy and transport routes in its early states, but today with an estimated 225 per cent of South Africans HIV positive - most people clearly acquire HIV from other types of relations.

## A summary of the book:

This article's central argument is that the close association between sex and gifts - transactional sex - is a central factor driving multiple-partnered sexual relationships, the principal cause of HIV infection in Mandeni. Transactional sex has as number of similarities to prostitution but it differs: participants are constructed as girlfriends and boyfriends, and the exchange of gifts for sex is part of a broader set of obligations that may not have a payment. The use of transactional sex is intended neither to maintain inflexible distinctions between categories of prostitution / transactional and non-transactional sex.

There are three factors that lead to transactional sex: the privileged economic position of men, masculine discourse that place a high value on men having multiple sexual partners and finally the agency of women itself - approaching these relations to access power and resources that both challenge and reproduce patriarchal structures.

This article compares different forms of transactional sex in Isithebe Informal Settlement and Sundumbili Township, two localities only a few kilometres apart in Mandeni. It notes how *sex linked to subsistence* is prominent in the informal settlement whereas *sex linked to consumption* is more prominent in the township - linked to the different structural positions of women and social meanings. On the former, processes of industrialisation, de-industrialisation and migration created acute gendered inequalities that comes together to fuel transactional sex. In the township, most of the large youth population is able to acquire subsistence and thus women invoke discourse of 'rights' to justify freedom of movement.

## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Masculinity and Money in Mandeni

```ad-summary
Economic processes come together with masculinities to fuel transaction linked to sex. This section focuses on an examination of the changing meanings of the word *isoka* - an important element in discourses on sexuality. Analysis is then extended into the broader relationship between masculinities and gendered practices, including transactional sex.
```

There are two meanings to the word *isoka* - a woman's boyfriend and a man who is successful with women.

The second meaning forms a discourse on masculinity but sets a certain limits. Until fairly recently, men were discouraged from engaging in penetrative sexual intercourse. Until recently, men were discouraged from penetrative intercourse - pregnancies were punished by the payment of *ihlawulo* (damages) and a man was expected to marry the pregnant girl.

Whilst it was desirable to have many girlfriends, a man who refused to marry could be positioned as *isoka lamanyala* (a dirty *isoka*). 

Now, marriage plays a diminished role in setting the boundaries for acceptable manly behaviour.

title: The long-standing association between the economy and marriage:

In the pre-colonial period, the patriarch at the head of the homestead played a pivotal role in sustaining the institution of marriage through allocating livestock for his son's *ilobolo* (bridewealth) payments. The 19th century minerals revolution shook this system fundamentally as now mining employment allowed young men to pay bridewealth. Miners sought manhood by returning to their rural homes, taking a wife and building a homestead. Non-marital sexual relationships became common in urban and rural areas.

As the rural economy weakened and secondary industry expanded, marriage became detached from the homestead economy and increasingly dependent on wage labour. The market economy replaced the homestead patriarch as the gatekeeper to manhood through marriage. The formal economy stagnated and now many men in Kwazulu-Natal cannot afford the bridewealth. Weddings have become rarer.

"The decline in marriages and women's increased dependence on men are arguably critical factors that now make it much more acceptable for men to "maintain" a handful of girlfriends, even father their children, with little intention of marrying them." (107).

Subtle reworkings of *isoka* and *isoka lamanyala* constitute these practices - the 16 year old respondent Nhlanhla uses *isoka* to mean a successful man with women, success defined as having many sexual relationships even in lieu of marriage with an *isoka lamanyala* being a man who has more than the acceptable number of sexual partners.

"This causalisation of male/female relationships ... transforms the flow of resources between families, individuals and sexes. With marriage unaffordable for many men and women, men's gifts to multiple-girlfriends have increasingly replaced *ilobolo* payments to parents." (108). Now, sexual relationships are cemented with gifts from men. 

These relationships are not seen as prostitutions - women will *qoma* (choose) a lover whereas a prostitute will sell her body. Prostitutes are seen as scarce in Mandeni and are positioned as outsiders.

Men's privileged economic position allows them considerable control over women's bodies - including the use of contraception. Women on the other hand face dilemmas over using birth control - although the risk of childbirth falls, there is a risk of contracting AIDS from unprotected sex.

"Male coercion, however, is often mediated through subtle discourses of persuasion. Men will convince women that using a condom represents "unfaithfulness"" (109).

In reality, *isoka* as a word is deeply contested - older men try to emphasise a respectable masculinity and look in distaste at a younger isoka who have many sexual partners.

This is underwrit with class differences - in a winner-takes-all sexual economy, those marginalised from the productive economy will face marginalisation from the sexual economy. Poor men complain about being unable to attract girlfriends. Class consciousness is constructed in relation to the sexual and not simply the productive economy.

### Subsistence, Consumption and Transactional Sex

This segment looks at women's motivations for engaging in these relationships, emphasising how transactional sex varies across space. Two groups are compared: migrant women in the informal settlement and young women in Sundumbili Township.

#### Isithebe Informal Settlement: Subsistence before Consumption (110-111)

Most migrants prefer to stay in the informal settlement where accommodation is cheaper. They will receive support from relatives and friends, and rely on men to provide them with subsistence - rent. Women will choose a man in regards to subsistence.

Women typically see multiple-boyfriends as a means to gaining control over their lives. The vocabulary of sex is suggestive of women's agency - transactional sex grants resources directly to women themselves, having a sense of choice. (111)

"Indeed, women typically see multiple-boyfriends as a means to gaining control over their lives , rather than as simply acts of desperation - although the two of course are linked. The very vocabulary of sex centred, for women, around the verb qoma (to choose a man) is suggestive of women’s agency. Certainly, unlike the lobola system that is based on male-to-male transactions, transactional sex does grant resources directly to women themselves.

Sex linked to subsistence coexists with sex linked to consumption in multiple ways: some boyfriends' presents are used to make women more desirable in the eyes of other men. The author uses Thandi's story on how her sexual partners function to support the household economy and provide consumption goods.

#### Sundumbili Township: Fashion and Sugar Daddies (113-115)

This township was extended to accommodate workers from Isithebe's growing number of factories. Roads, water and everything! Owning one of the four-roomed 'matchbox' houses gave men a secure base to launch investments in small businesses. Today, residents see the township as civilised in comparison with the informal settlements that are seen as *"at the farms".

Access to consumer goods is dependent on one's economic standing or partner - sugar daddies are at the apex of the social structure, operating taxis, working as teachers and more. There is a mixture of sex linked to subsistence and sex linked to consumption but the balance leans towards the latter. Gifts from these relationships will contribute to the household economy. (114)

For some women, money is not the only advantage of sugar daddies - they are more experienced and they have TLC.

The final difference is the importance of the English language dominated media to the construction of sexual identities in the township. Here, images from the TV, radio and magazines signify modernity.

### Transactional Sex in Mandeni, the paradox

In Mandeni there exists a paradox: high levels of awareness about AIDS yet unsafe sexual practices are still common. It is the dominance and taken-for-granted nature of transactional sex that is little understood factor fuelling the HIV pandemic in this area.

"What is critical to the high rates of HIV infection in Mandeni, however, is the way that these come together at such a time and in such a way to lead to transactional sex between multiple concurrent partners":
1. First factor is the creation of massive gendered material inequalities constructed through the labour and housing markets, leaving some men relatively, marginalising others and creating a group of impoverished women
2. Second is the production of masculinities that place a high value on men having multiple sexual partners
3. Third is the agency of women - whether using sex for subsistence or consumption, women sew themselves into the fabric of masculinity through their own agency.

Women in the informal settlement have fewer resources, and there may be expectations that they remit money to rural homes. The township contains a large youth population that have subsistence. These shape how transactional sex is approaches. In the township, women see themselves as having more "rights" and control whereas with the Isithebe Informal Settlement that allows the youth less freedom.
