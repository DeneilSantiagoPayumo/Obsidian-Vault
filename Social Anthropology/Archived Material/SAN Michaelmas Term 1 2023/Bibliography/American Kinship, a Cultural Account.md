## Introduction 1

This book is concerned with American kinship, By symbols we mean those that stand for something else where there is no necessary or intrinsic relationship between the symbol and what it symbolises.

A particular culture consists of a system of units which are defined in certain ways and which are differentiated according to certain criteria. These help define the world or the universe, the ways the things in it relate to each other.

A unit in a culture is the way anything is culturally defined and distinguished as an entity - a person, place, thing, feeling, state of affairs.

Unit is understood as part of some relatively distinct, self-contained system.

Cultural categories and units do not have single-lexeme names and the description of cultural units is by no means exhausted.

The meanings of the names are not exactly the meaning of the cultural units. Words are one of the best ways to begin to discover what these units are.


Culture is in one sense a regularity of human behaviour - objective and real.
Among the different forms, one consists of the definition and differentiation of persons in interaction - a set of rules that dictates who should do what. The cultural constructs and cultural symbols are different from any systematic regular and verifiable pattern of actual observed behaviour.

The distinction between the definition of the units and rules and the pattern of actual behaviour is defined from the observation of traffic-light behaviour.

...

The question of whether there is a rule formulated as a cultural rule cannot be decided on the basis of such evidence. Such evidence is irrelevant to the question of whether there is or is not a cultural unit, a cultural concept.

The argument may be developed in this way: cultural units are not just given. They arise, grow and change. One essential problem is to chart the relationship between the actual states of affairs and the cultural constructs so we can discover how they are generated, the laws governing their change and more.

*Skipped a lot*

The specific objective of this book is to describe the system of symbols and meanings of American kinship - showing the cultural definition of the units of American kinship as it occurs. It tries to show the rules, how these units relate and do not.

*Skipped the rest.*

## CHAPTER TWO: RELATIVES 21

Explicit definition - a relative is a person who is related by blood or by marriage.

One can begin to discover what a relative is in American culture by considering those terms which are the names for the kind of relatives and which mark the scheme for their classification.

We've got basic terms and derivative terms - cousin, second cousin and more..

The restrictive sharply divides blood relatives from those who are not whereas the unrestrictive states the unlimited range of certain relatives.

The unrestrictive modifiers mark difference, by degrees of distance. The first criteria - blood or marriage is central.


### II
If a relative is a person defined by blood what does this mean?
The blood relationship is formulated in concrete terms - conception follows a single act of sexual intercourse. A child takes part of both the mothers and fathers make up, marking the child as blood relatives.

It is not believed in American kinship that the father provides the bone and mother the flesh - in this conception, kinship is defined as biogenetic. If science updates then that is known all along.

The relationship which is real or true or blood or by birth may never be severed - blood relationship can never be lost as it is defined as an objective fact of nature.

We can disown people but the people still remain relatives.

The blood relatives are related by the fact they share in some degree the stuff of heredity - each has a portion of the genetic substance and their kinship occurs in common possession.

Because blood is a 'thing' and is subdivided with each reproductive step away from an ancestor, the degree to which people share heredity can be calculated.

A blood relationship is a relationship of identity - people who are blood relatives share a common identity, expressed as being 'of the same flesh and blood' - belief in common biological constitutions and aspects like temperament, build, habits and more. Children are said to take after certain people.

In sum, the definition of a relative as someone related by blood or marriage is explicit in American culture. People speak of it in just those terms and do so readily when asked. The conception of a child occurs during an act of sexual intercourse. The blood relationship is thus a relationship of substance and material.

### III 25
Relative by marriage is defined with reference to relative by blood - the fundamental element that defines a relative by blood is of blood itself. It is a natural entity.

Marriage is not a material thing in the same sense as biogenetic heredity is - it is not a natural thing. As state of affairs it is natural.

Where blood is both material and natural, marriage is neither - where blood endures, marriage is terminable.

If relatives by marriage are not related in nature, how are they related?

Consider foster and in-laws, the fundamental fact about these relatives is that they have the role of close relatives without being 'real or blood relatives'.

It is possible to describe a foster-child's relationship to his foster parents or a step-child's relationship to his step-parent.

The natural and material basis for the relationship is absent but relatives of this kind have a relationship in the sense of following a pattern for behaviour or code of conduct.

When a person is related to a blood relative he is related by common biogenetic heredity, natural substance and a relationship. The distinctive feature which defines the order of blood relatives is blood - blood relatives are thus 'related by nature'. This is a special instance of the natural order of things in American kinship.


The feature that distinguishes relatives by marriage is their relationship. This is the order of law. It is law as a parent who fails to care for a child is brought to law.

In this sense a mother-in-law but is in the relationship of mother-child to her child's spouse - it is in this sense that a step-mother is not a real mother.

If there is a relationship in law without a relationship in law. What is called a natural child is - a child born out of wedlock. He is natural as his relationship is just of nature and not law.


### IV 27

In sum, the cultural universe of relatives in American kinship is constructed from two major cultural orders - the order of nature and the order of law. Relatives in nature share heredity and relatives in law are bound only by law or custom. They are relatives by virtue of their relationships.

Three classes of relatives are constructed from these two elements.

First there is the special class of relatives in nature alone - the natural or illegitimate child. The second class consists of relatives in law alone. The third class consists in relatives in nature and in law.

The second and third classes of relatives can be divided into subclasses - the second class, relatives in law alone, consists of the subclass of husband and wife and the remainder.

The third class consists of two subclasses - the father and daughter set of relatives, the second of those relatives who take the uncle ... granddaughter and cousin terms. The modifier functions symbolise the differences between these two subclasses.

These categories are built out of two elements - relationships as natural substances and relationship as code for conduct. Each of these elements derives from or is a special instance of the two major orders which American culture posits the world to be made up of, the order of nature and the order of law.

## THE FAMILY

35

It is only natural in the American view that the various tasks of protecting the home, of providing the necessities of life, of giving care and instruction to the young, and so forth, be divided according to natural talents, aptitude, and endowments of those involved.

Women bear children. This is part of their nature.

Men do not bear children. They are not naturally endowed with ways of sensing infants needs. Thus, they will learn slowly and not the skill that a woman can exhibit.

The basis of authority - we take care of a hapless child. In this sense, nature constitutes the family and the natural roles of husband, wife, father, mother and child. It is in this sense that the distinctive features or elements of the family posit the mated pair who rear their young in a place of their own

That said, there is a shift in informant statements once this is said - at one level it is the family as a natural units and natural roles of the family, then 'something more' that is endowed upon natural endowments. Being 'older' means more wisdom, 'being a man' means having the qualities women lack and more.

Human reason builds on a natural base creating something additional. It also selects only part of nature on which to build - composed of both a  good and bad part, human and animal.

The family is defined as a natural unit based on the facts of nature.

What is human is a part of nature but has a special part, a role so natural that it is natural only in the sense of being close to animal. A person who is interested in sex alone is not a good husband or wife, but by very same token the role removed from nature, so highly reasoned and cultivated as to to lack any natural element is said to be unnatural. By this measure, a person uninterested in copulation cannot be regarded as a good family or wife.


### III 37

The fact of nature on which all cultural construct of the family is based on is sexual intercourse.

A relative is a person who is related by blood or marriage - relatives linked by blood are linked by material substance, husband and wife are linked by law. Relatives by blood are objective whereas husband and wife are linked subjectivity. Blood is a permanent tie, the marriage can be terminated.

A relationship by blood is involuntary - a blood relationship is not a matter of human volition. It is a part of the natural order and follows nature whereas marriage follows law.

We cannot choose our blood relatives. They become us at birth.

Blood is a matter of birth, birth a matter of procreation and procreation of sexual intercourse.

Sexual intercourse is an act of procreation which creates the blood relationship of parent and child and makes genitor out of husband and wife. It is an act exclusive to husband-wife relationship.

Sexual intercourse is often called making love.

There are two kinds of love in American kinship - conjugal love, erotic and having sexual act as its concrete embodiment and cognatic love, the blood relationship and identity of natural substance and heredity which obtains for parent and child its symbolic expression.

Cognatic love is not inherently erotic. Infants and children are not believed to have sexual relationships.

The kiss is an expression of love - the direct kiss on the lips is erotic. A kiss on the cheek is a cognatic statement.

The conjugal love of husband and wife is opposite of the cognatic love of parent, child and sibling - a union of opposites versus the unity identities have,

It is the symbol of love that links conjugal and cognatic love together and relates them through the symbol of sexual intercourse.

As a symbol of unity or oneness, love is the union of flesh, of opposites, male and female, man and woman. Unity of opposites if affirmed in the outcome, the blood of the child - the child brings together the different biogenetic substances of their parents.

Both love and sexual intercourse turn on two distinct elements - one is the unification of opposites, the other is the separation of unities.

Male and female are united in sexual intercourse as husband and wife. Their different biogenetic substances are united in the child conceived of that union and their relationship to each other is unified.

Incest consists in unifying what is one to begin with, with the device for unifying opposites and failing to separate what was one into two, inverting both sides of the formula.

The symbol of love bridges these two different elements that unifies the opposites of male and female, serving the unity of the differentiated and differentiating the parents and their children.

One informant - what's your definition of a relative? Someone who you love, who is kind to you, who is related to you by blood. It sums the matter up.

All the significant symbols of American kinship are contained in the figure of sexual intercourse, itself a symbol. Throughout, each element is culturally defined as natural is at the same time augmented and elaborated, built upon by human reason.

### IV 40

Other facts of nature - two different domains of sex, of sexual attributes and sexual intercourse.

Sexual intercourse is the symbol which provides the distinctive feature or elements on which the family is defined. Sexual attributes constitute facts of nature of great importance to the family.

Different qualities of maleness and femaleness are made to fit men and women for different kinds of activities and occuptations - men's active qualities make them good soldiers whereas women are presumped to be passive.

Here, sex-role occurs in a context that emphasises some of its special aspets. Men rely on strength and is a policeman whereas women may be nurses and quiet.

The fact remains by cultural definition father is male and cannot be female, mother is female and cannot be male, husband is male and wife is female. How do we understand this, that there are two distinct cultural units that are easily confused (man's job, woman's job) but must be kept separate - the same person can be both a woman and a wife; work ina  woman's work is never done is part of her definition as a woman and not as a wife.

What defines the cultural units of husbband and wife or father and mother? It is not their sex - being a man is not sufficient condition for being a husband or father.

Consider three features - genitals, facial hair and activity. Which is the distinctive feature? The distinctive feature which define the members of the family and differentiate them from each other and define the family as a unit and distinguish it from other untis are contained in the symbol of sexual intercourse ...

....

51 In summary, the family in American kinship as a paradigm for how members should conduct themselves is simple - a system of small number of symbols define the members of the family, defining and differentiating the members of the family.

The members of the family are defined in terms of sexual intercourse as a reproductive act, stressing the sexual relationship between husband and wife.

The symbol of love bridges the two culturally distinguished domain, first the domain of kinship as a relationship of substance and second the domain of kinship as code of conduct.

Sexual intercourse is love and stands as sign of love, love stands for sexual intercourse and is a sign of it.

...

The biological elements in this definition of kinship have the quality of symbols - that blood relatives share biogenetic substance is a symbol of unity and oneness, interchangeable with the symbol of love. This is restated in American kinship: child's being of the body of its mother, created by the voices of mother and father, taking milk from breast, notion of milk as human kindness and more.

Kinship in American culture is a relationship of diffuse solidarity. What distinguishes friends and relatives is that we are born from our relatives but we can pick our friends.

### A Relative Is a Person 57

The decision as to who is and who is not a relative is made about a person - a major unit of American culture, different from other kinds in that they are defined by culture with the ability to do and act. It has a primary identity, defines the relevant cultural domain in terms of he acts.

Different elements are blended together to make the definition of the person.

We have found in American kinship that the family is a paradigm for what each relative is and how they should behave toward each other - the father is the genitor, the mother the genetrix, husband and wife in a sexual relationship ... the family in this sense consists of the self-contained set of symbols differentiated out of the central symbol of sexual intercourse and love. It defines what a relative is in the abstract, stating what the relationship between relatives is by definition.

Kinship is distinct in American culture of symbols and concepts defined and differentiated without reference to person, place or time - distinct in American culture from relatives as persons and the family as group of persons. The relative as a person is different from the distinctive features which define the person as a relative.

A person as a cultural unit is a composite, a compound of a variety of different elements from different symbolic subsystems or domains. People have male or female sex as defined from the sex-role system.

It is the construct of a person which articulates the conceptual and symbolic domains of American culture and translate.

In American culture the person is conceptualized as concrete as well as abstract both as a set of normative standards and as a real living individual who should try to behave in accordance with those norms. The family in this sense is the same order of cultural construct as the church as a body of worshippers.

I have said that the person is a cultural construct so defined as to be able to act, to play a role in real life - the construct of a person is a normative guide for how a person should behave or act.

Love has two implications - reference to the specific set of symbols in which the kinship is defined and differentiated and the paradigm: there should be no sexual intercourse between blood relatives but sexual intercourse between husband and wife for their love is conjugal.

A second implication which love has for how relatives should behave toward each other can be summed up: enduring, diffuse solidarity.

Love in this meaning must be expressed or represented by some specific act which is its sign  act representing solidarity that is infinite. Working too hard, not workign too hard, beneficial or harmful.

In sum, the relative as a person is different from the distinctive kind of features that define the person as a relative. There are also two kinds of persons - the abstract person which is a normative construct and the concrete individual. the self-contained set of symbols of which American kinship is composed constitutes the distinctive features that define the person a relative.

Person as a relative is made up of distinctive feature other than kinship - sex-role, age-role and more, The distinctive feature of the way in which relatives should behave to each other is specified by the symbol of love. Love is the most flexible of symbols as it is expressed in a wide variety of ways.

Finally, we speak of person as of American culture and a cultural unit.


### II 62

The rule is simple - a person is a relative if he is related by blood or marriage and provided he is closely enough related.

Its application depends in the meaning of the terms in which is cast - if the meanings of blood, marriage, distance and relative is clear, the application is clear.

It is a fundamental premise of the American kinship system that blood is a substance and that is quite distinctive from the kind of relationship, code for conduct, pattern which persons who share that substance, blood, are supposed to have. The distinction is the same as that between relationship as substance and relationship as code for conduct.

These two elements are quite distinct, each can occur alone or in combination. They are quite distinct and a person can base his decision as to who to count and who not to count. THe normative construct of a relative can be compounded.

Substance has the highest value, code for conduct less value, the two together - blood relatives - have the highest value of all. Where each element occurs alone, relatives of greater distance will be counted as kin or as relatives if there is only a substantive element present.

If a person plays a kinship role or undertakes a kinship relationship lacking any substantive element, he may or may not be counted as a relative is only substance is present than if code for conduct alone is present.

There is a correlative element here - any given kinship term can either mean the substance element or conduct. We cannot infer from given usage which one is being denoted.

Distance is simply the statement of kinship in quantitative terms - a measure of the degree to which two persons share common biogenetic substance and a statement of the magnitude of the claim of diffuse enduring solidarity. Distance is a statement of 'how much' solidarity contains. A relationship which is close is one where the claim is high, one that is far away is one where the claim is smaller. How much means both magnitude and that magnitude is expressed by differences of kind.

The different value attached to substance as against code for conduct holds in the measurement of distance too - insofar as the persons concerned are blood relatives, the degree to which they share common heredity is the first measure of distance which is applied to them.

Marriage is the relationship between husband and wife, maintained by consent. A person is related to another by marriage when that other person is his spouse. By marriage is the term for the class of relatives related in law as opposed to by blood, standing for those who are related apart from the persons.

This is the rule according to which concrete persons name other concrete persons as their relatives, according to which normative constructs are formed for relatives as distinct from persons who are not relatives. For particular classes of relatives, normative constructs add the specific distinctive feature for that particular kind of relative. To form the norm for a husband, the norm for a relative is taken to exclude biological substance. Then, from the sex-role differentiation system, the definition of male sex is added, distinguishing the husband from the wife.

...

75 In sum the fuzzy boundary, the famous relative, the ambiguous notion of distance are all phenomena of American kinship which derive in part from the fact that at one level the relative is a person and the person of the relative is compounded of elements from a variety of different domains, only one of which is kinship. Whether a particular person is counted as a relative depends on how the general rule is applied. Because the decision of who is and who is not a relative is made by a person, because the rule governing is so ambiguous, the application leads to empirical regularities.

76, 87
(Fuzzy Boundary - distant relatives, wakes-and-weddings, defined by relatives only seen far away, dead people are omitted.)

(Famous relative, a famous personage. Sometimes the relationship was traceable, sometimes not. Where it was traceable, this was the only relative of such distance on the geneaology whereas closer relatives are not known.)

(As one goes out from the ego, things get more fuzzy - there is no formal clear limit to the range of kinsmen. There is no decision as t whether a particular person is or is not to be counted as a relative is not given in any simple categorical sense.)

## Conclusion 107

The relationship between man and nature in American culture is an active one. It is man's place to dominate nature and control it.

At home, things are different and American culture appears to turn things topsy-turvy. This is one part of nature with which man has made his peace and in terms of which he is content to find his fate. What is out there in nature, the definitions of American culture, is what kinship is. Kinship is the blood relationship, the mother's bond of flesh and blood with her child.

Yet man is defined as being part of nature, Yet both paragraphs are true of American culture and both represent American culture.

Sexuality is a case in point - only one legitimate according to culture (heterosexual relations). Man is faced with an array of possibilities he must master. Heterosexual relations are defined as the natural state of affairs and how it should be.

The antithesis between man and nature is resolved by the premise that man is only one part of nature - if man is viewed as part of nature, then the antithesis is at a different level - man as animal, man as human.. But intelligence is not something alone: it is a part of nature that exists alone and of which is part of nature that American culture is defined as animal.

Man's capacity is to reason, the premise of American culture has it, against animal's unreason.

Another contradiction - it seems clearly given in American culture it departs from what is animal in nature and departs from what is natural.

...

I have put the relations between men and nature as a set of contradictions resolved in various ways.

The formal category of nature includes within it both man and animal. The pattern is the same as that for the category 'relative' where the word is used to include anyone related by blood or marriage, but is reserved for blood relatives alone.

The category of blood follows through - a combination of substance and code for conduct which those who share blood should have. Its meaning both includes substance, and substance and law.

The notion of distance can be physical, socioemotional and genealogical.

The most important distinction in American kinship between the relative as a person and the distinctive features which define the person as a relative.

...

The answer is clear. The system of distinctive features defined and differentiated in terms of one central symbol constitutes a firm, fixed core which provides the defining feature for every kind of person. 

...

### III 114

Sexual intercourse can be seen as a set of biological facts.

There are certain cultural notions about biological facts - a cultural system explicitly attuned to these facts. But it remains a system of cultural constructs which should not be confused with the facts themselves.

There are certain cultural notions symbolized by cultural notions depicting biological facts.

An example - the heart. It is a body of science. It is a heartbreaking moment when someone loses their loved one. This is not a set of biological facts, or a theory about biological fact. But it is a poor example - there is a world of difference between the biological fact of the heart and the idea of a broken heart.

In American culture, kinship is biology - the broken heart and heartache is not.

Kinship and family is defined as being nature itself. They see the facts of flesh and blood as the pertinent fact, the fact that it contains the identity of parent and child, which contain the force that compels feelings between the two and makes it natural.

These biological facts exist and remain.

There is also a system of constructs about those - but they have a symbolic quality, representing something other than what they are. They symbolise diffuse, enduring solidarity, a kind of interpersonal relations with which people must be. Trust. In the same way that reproduction is a set of biological facts that is prerequisites to the continuity of a society as a body of people, diffuse solidarity is a social prerequisite.

---

Summarised ideas from Think Like An Anthropologist: not only in US but wherever we find ideas about kinship built up from those of biology and nature within the broader framework of modernity. Americans consider blood relations fundamental and enduring. They link blood and genes by saying 'in my blood' - kinship relations are not limited to other blood relations they are also formed through marriage. The bonds of marriage are subjective and blood relations are not.

Blood is the ultimate form of identity and all other relations get categorized in terms of it.

In this analysis, blood is always the real. Kinship thus is really about biology.

Main sources of identity: middle class whites, some African-Americans and Japanese-Americans and minorities from all class backgrounds.

155-157

Schneider's work in deconstructing American kinship precipitated a change - showing how a focus on flesh-and-blood blood kin can limit the ways we understand people as related.

Blood serves as a symbolic resource and template. How blood is uttered matters a lot.
