Basso K. 1979. Portraits of "the Whiteman": Linguistic Play and Cultural Symbols among the Western Apache.

>[!summary]
>'The Whiteman' is one of the most powerful and pervasive symbols in contemporary American Indian cultures. Portraits of 'the Whiteman': linguistic play and cultural symbols among the Western Apache investigates a complex form of joking in which Apaches stage carefully crafted imitations of Anglo-Americans and, by means of these characterizations, give audible voice and visible substance to their conceptions of this most pressing of social 'problems'. Keith Basso's essay, based on linguistic and ethnographic materials collected in Cibecue, a Western Apache community, provides interpretations of selected joking encounters to demonstrate how Apaches go about making sense of the behaviour of Anglo-Americans. This study draws on theory in symbolic anthropology, sociolinguistics, and the dramaturgical model of human communication developed by Erving Goffman. Although the assumptions and premises that shape these areas of inquiry are held by some to be quite disparate, this analysis shows them to be fully compatible and mutually complementary.

This summary will look at the following chapters:
1. Indian models of "the Whiteman"
3. Joking imitations of Anglo-Americans: interpretive functions
4. Joking imitations of Anglo-Americans: social functions
## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Making sense of people (specifically, American Indian conceptions of 'the Whiteman')

Why?
	By analysing their symbolic content and attending to what they communicate about aspects of the generic *us* - we who are Whitemen can develop a sharper and more sensitive awareness of the impressions we make upon persons whose practices for organising and interpreting social experience differ from our own."

This study centres around the Western Apache, an area in Cibecue.

"In short, code-switching is a linguistic device for framing verbal messages. It is a fine-grained technique for identifying stretches of talk as particular kinds of doings that are intended to accomplish particular kinds of "work." (8)

By using this style of speech, switching from 'Western Apache' to 'English' they make a statement about themselves and other people. "It is this distinctive style of speaking .... that signals ... that a particular form of joking has begun ... register information about the joker's immediate surroundings ... the joker's personal identity ... joker's social identity ... and, most important of all, the joker's relationship with the person who is the object of his joke." (9)

The author uses this description of a girl who is playing with a puppy. She picks it up by the tail, and it bites her. She swears at it in Apache, then jokes about it in English before switching back. The dog is ready to bite her:

```ad-quote
"What has happened, of course, is that the girl has installed herself and her puppy in an imaginary world of play.
...
Almost entirely through the use of language, the girl has evoked this primary world to impose a definition upon her own situation. Simultaneously, she has turned a corner of her camp into a classroom, her dog into a rambunctious second grader and, most conspicuous of all, herself into an irate Anglo-American schoolteacher." (11)
```

The Apache do not just imitate a social category and its values. They construct models and make animated representations of these models - stylized gestures, facial expressions, in a sense becoming Anglo-Americans. The Apache mobilise a set of general ideas about the 'white man' and adapt them to their own premises and circumstances.

### Joking imitations of Anglo-Americans: interpretive functions

This interpretation of joking imitations proceeds on these two assumptions: that joking is a form of play, and that play is characterised by a paradox of the Russellian or Epimenides type, consisting of a negative statement that contains within it an implicit negative metastatement.

Apache argue that the conditions for the joke are both 'funny' and 'generous'. Why?

Jokes that are the latter are defined by one attribute: the person at whom the joke is directed at is depicted as something they are not. There are three ways in which someone can be turned into a metaphor:
1. Likening the subject to a class of material objects ("I guess your rifle case will be warm enough.")
2. Metaphorically placing the subject in a social category to which he or she does not rightfully belong, typically in reference to a third party who is absent from the scene. "[Smiling] She [The wife] left me three days ago, and now I'm lonely and hungry." It's important to note with this example, the wife in question that is being referred to is not the speaker's wife. This woman is a widow who has great lovemaking skills.
3. The Joker placing himself in a social category to which he does not belong, and, by acting as if his membership in that category were valid, proceeds to locate the subject in another category, equally fictitious, that is associated with the first. (39) ("You better act properly like everyone else. Don't drink too much! I'm the speaker here. I don't want any trouble. I want you to think right.")

Jokes involving Anglo-Americans are said to be dangerous and also 'funny'. They are made amusing, and the joke not only animates the character but it also portrays one.

A different principle is formed: Western Apache jokers want to make these Anglo-Americans ludicrous and use a single strategy - epitomization - that is informed through two principles of *contrast* and *distortion*: specifying two conditions on which elements are to be selected and how.

The image the joker presents of "the Whitemen" is an image of ineffectively guided behaviour, of social action gone haywire.

Elements of mockery:
1. "Hello, my friend!" .. In short, Anglo-Americans pretend to what cannot and should not be pretended to - hasty friendship - and it strikes Apaches as the height of folly and presumptuousness that they do. (48)
2. "How you doing? How you feeling, L?" .. unsolicited queries concerning an individual's health or emotional state constitute impertinent violations of personal privacy.

The immediate effect of joking imitations places two versions of human guidedness in sharp juxtaposition. These expressions function as compact interpretations of the joker's model of the 'whiteman', providing keys and guidelines that others can use to draw conclusions of their own.

"By making of "the Whiteman" an improbable buffoon, Apache jokers isolate and accentuate significant contrasts between their own cultural practices and those of Anglo-Americans. And by presenting the behaviour of Anglo-Americans as something laughable and "wrong", by displaying with the help of butts how and why it violates the rights of others, they denounce these standards as morally deficient and unworthy of emulation." (64)

### Joking imitations of Anglo-Americans: social functions

The traditional analogy: joking developments solidarity in interpersonal relationships to the process by which 'deerhides' are fashioned into pieces of fine 'buckskin.'

Interpersonal relationships are stiff and of little value and must be worked through stages of pliability until they become soft. Untanned hides can be cracked and individuals who enjoy soft relationships can establish sound bonds of mutual confidence and affection.

Joking can be dangerous - there is always a possibility that a joker's actions may be interpreted as veiled expressions of genuine hostility, that a person truly isn't joking at all. This paradox may cause the buckskin analogy to break - how can activity function to maintain solidarity and also function to weaken it?

The Apache answer: the parties should allow ample time to pass before they start to joke. Different forms of joking are understood to vary in their capacity to engender antagonism and ill will.

The most dangerous of those jokes are of the banagozdi variety (generosity) in which the joker takes on the identity of someone who indicates by his disrespectful treatment of the butt that he thinks of himself as being better than other people.

Too often, Anglo-Americans have made Apaches "feel small", and being reminded of this, even in fun, is never entirely funny. (72)

```ad-quote
For such is the antipathy of Apaches to being 'looked down' upon that even the mildest displays of arrogance and self-importance may trigger strong reactions ... thus, imitations of Anglo-Americans entail a degree of risk that only persons with fully softened relationships are normally prepared to take." (73)

"Herein lies the gist of the social meanings communicated by joking imitations of Anglo-Americans. A relationship in which goodwill is abundantly present is represented as one in which it is conspicuously absent." (75-76)
