# Vincent Crapanzano - Hermes' Dilemma: The Masking of Subversion in Ethnographic Description

51

"The ethnographer does not, however, translate the texts the way the translator does ... he must first produce them. Text metaphors for culture and society notwithstanding, the ethnographer has no primary and independent text that can be read and translated by others."

The ethnographer acknowledges the provisional nature of his interpretation ... yet he assumes a final interpretation - a definite reading.

The ethnographer does not recognize the provisional nature of his presentations. They are definitive and he does not accept as a paradox that his provisional interpretations support his definitive presentation.

52

Ethnography closes in on itself. There could be a possibility that the general theories the ethnographer generates are mere refractions of another register.

The ethnographer is caught in a second paradox. He must make sense of the foreign - aim a solution to the problem of foreignness and translate the foreignness that his interpretations deny. He must render the foreign familiar and preserve its very foreignness at one and the same time, accomplishing this through style.

The ethnographer must make his message convincing, treating of the foreign that challenges beliefs, making use of all the persuasive devices to convince the reader the truth of his sentiment.

53

We will look at Geertz - his authority, his presence at the events described, his perceptual ability, his disinterested perspective and so on. His presence does not alter it, his disinterest are undercut by his self-interest - his need to establish a bond with his reader, his interlocuters, to create a distance.

69

Erotic puns position the ethnographer between his world of primary orientation and his reader's world, and the world of those other, the people he has studied. The puns appeal collusively to the members of the other world, thereby creating a hierarchal relationship between them.

His essay begins with a humorous tale of entry - the hero is an awkward simpleton, not sure of his identity. He is not in his room and not mastered the new world.

He establishes an opposition between himself and his wife. Geertz and his wife are anthropologists.

70

Geertz blurs his own subjectivity with the subjectivity and intentionality of the village: also, where did his wife go?

Through puns and declarations, the anthropologist and 'Balinese' are separated from one another. The Balinese are generalized and Geertz is cast as individuals.

71

Geertz likens his nonperson-hood to being a 'cloud' or 'gust of wind', uses pronouns like 'you', an appeal to the reader to empathize with him.

72

There is a continual blurring of Geertz's understanding and the understanding of the Balinese. He attributes to the Balinese all sorts of experiences. On what ground does he attribute 'social embarrassment', 'moral satisfaction' or 'disgust' to the Balinese.

As though pulling a rabbit of a hat, Geertz declares the cockfight to be an art form. We must ask, for whom does the cockfight articulate everyday experience - the experience of status hierarchy - and render it perceptible?

Who is historically positioned to appreciate the construction> He ignores that King Lear and Crime and Punishment are marked as a tragedy and a novel, representations of a particular order. He offers no proof that the cockfight is so marked.

For Geertz, the interpreted text is a drama of status hierarchy and suggests it is why Balinese go to cockfights.

74

Who told Geertz? How can a whole people share a single subjectivity? There is only the constructed understanding of the constructed native's constructed point of view - no specifiable evidence for his attributions of intention, his assertations of subjectivity - appear to be nothing more than projections.

His imagery of the anthropologist straining to read texts creates an asymmetrical we-relationship with the anthropologist behind and above the native. It reflects the drama of "The Raid" - an "I-They" relationship that has the I replaced by an authority.

75

His encounter with the people he studied is rarely described - a general picture. Geertz never describes a *specific* cockfight. Geertz's essay is less a disquisition on Balinese cockfighting than interpreting cultural data.

76

The ethnographer will cast his shadow over the book.

## Talal Asad - The Concept of Cultural Translation in British Social Anthropology

142

He refers to 'translation' not to linguistic matter but to the 'mode of thoughts' embodied in such matters.

143

Gellner's "Concepts and Society" is concerned with the ways in which Functionalist anthropologists deal with problems of interpreting and translating the discourse of alien societies - his argument that contemporary anthropologists insist on interpreting exotic concepts, ensure that absurd assertations are given an acceptable meaning, and the "excessive charity" that usually goes with these contextual methods of interpretations are not valid.

Gellner rushes to define the "moderate Functionalism" as a method - consisting of the insistence that concepts exist in the life of me and societies.

The reader might expect a discussion of the ways in which language is encountered.

145

Gellner insisted that its concern with understanding everyday language is merely a disguise for defending established ways of speaking about the world - determined to maintain the distinction between defending and explaining "concepts and beliefs" and to warn against the anthropological translation that rules out a priori the distance necessary for explaining how concepts actually function.

This leads him to discuss [[Emile Durkheim]]'s *Elementary Form of the Religious life* arguing that he was really concerned to explain the compulsiveness of what in practice did not seem to need any defence. He recognised its project - its attempt to explain the compulsive nature of socially defined concepts - but moves too hastily from a consideration of what might be involved in such a problem to a dismissal of Durkheim's attempt at explanation.

We're reminded that "the contemporary anthropologist typically "appears to make it a condition of a good translation that it conveys the coherence which he assumes is there to be found in primitive thought.""

146

Gellner argues that anthropologist carries a value notation - meaningful, absurd, sensible, silly, that he uses the 'good' and 'bad' to cover polar alternatives.

147

Assumptions - evaluative distinctions are reducible to good and bad, that translators must match sentence for sentence.
Gellner's parable requires the assumption that it is sentences that the latter matches, making an equivalence between a sentence in the local language and one in his own, noticing that the English sentence carries a "bad" impression.

Functionalist method requires that sentences be evaluated in terms of their social context - the worried anthropologist reinterprets the original sentence to produce a "good" translation.

... skipped ...

### The Inequality of Languages

156

Gellner misses most crucial aspects of the problem - the inequality of languages.

All good translations seek to reproduce the structure of an alien discourse - how that structure is reproduced will depend on the genre concerned, resources of the translator's language and so on. The further the form of life is from the original, the less mechanical the reproduction.

It is for the reader to evaluate that intention. A good translation should always precede a critique - an internal critique.

157

What happens when the languages are so remote it is difficult to rewrite a harmonious translation?

The best translator does not immediately assume that unusual difficulty in conveying the sense of an alien discourse, but instead examines the normal state of their language - arguing how tolerant an attitude the translator ought to display.

Pushing through the limits of one's habitual usages, this breaking down is never easy. He emphasises that the matter is not something that the translator can determine by individual activity, it is governed by institutionally defined power relations.

Take Arabic - material translated from European languages into Arabic. Arabic begins to undergo a transformation, such transformations signalling inequalities of the respective languages - varieties of knowledge to be learnt, models to be reproduced. A recognition of this fact reminds us that industrial capitalism transforms not only modes of production but also kinds of knowledge and styles of life in the Third World?

159

Anthropologists must write up "their people" and do so in conventions of representation already circumscribed. Cultural translation must accommodate itself to a different language. 

160

### Reading Other Cultures

This inequality in the power of language, that the anthropologist writes about an illiterate population for an English-speaking audience encourages a tendency to read the implicit in alien cultures.

The object of ethnographic translation is not the historically situated speech but culture - translate the culture the anthropologist must read and then reinscribe the implicit meanings that lie beneath.

One difference between the anthropologist and the linguist: whereas the latter is immediately faced with discourse, the former must construct the discourse as a cultural text in terms of meaning implicit.

161

The attribution of implicit meanings to an alien practice regardless they are acknowledged by its agents is a characteristic form of theological exercise.

162

If the anthropological translator has the final authority in determining the subject's meanings, then it is the former who becomes the real author - cultural translation is a matter of determining implicit meanings.

The power to create meanings for a subject through the notion of the unconscious, to authorize them is important - it may be pointed that the anthropologist does not impose, the analysis comes to the analyst. The anthropologist by contrast comes to the society he wants to read, he sees himself as a learner and withdraws from the society when he has adequate information to inscribe its culture.

163

It's important that the ethnographer's translation is a textual construct, a representation that cannot be contested - inscribed records have a great power to shape. The social authority of his ethnography matters, and that authority is inscribed in the institutionalized forces of industrial capitalist society that are tending to push the meanings of various Third World country in a single direction.

The process of cultural translation is enmeshed in conditions of power.

### Conclusion

The sociologism according to which religious ideologies are said to get their real meaning from the political or economic structure, evident to the authoritative anthropologist and not to the people being written about. This positions assumes that the anthropologist can act as translator and critic ... this position is untenable.

The positive point - the anthropological enterprise of cultural translation may be vitiated by the fact there are asymmetrical tendencies and pressures in the language of dominated and dominant societies. Anthropologists need to explore these processes.
