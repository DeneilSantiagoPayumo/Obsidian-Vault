Through close attention to the images in which we think and dream and through which we understand the world, Stevenson describes a world in which life is beside itself: the name-soul of a teenager who dies in a crash lives again in his friend’s new-born baby, a young girl shares a last smoke with a dead friend in a dream, and the possessed hands of a clock spin uncontrollably over its face.

> In these contexts, humanitarian policies make little sense because they attempt to save lives by merely keeping a body alive. For the Inuit, and perhaps for all of us, life is “somewhere else,” and the task is to articulate forms of care for others that are adequate to that truth.

## A summary of the book:

This book is divided into two parts concerning two events for the Canadian Inuit. First, it concerns itself with the tuberculosis epidemic (1940s to the early 1960s) and then the subsequent suicide epidemic.

Lisa Stevenson concerns itself with the idea of 'anonymous care', care advocated by the state that calls to treat every member it cares for as the same, disregarding personal identity. This has a number of disadvantages: the care perceived by the government during the tuberculosis epidemic, whilst good-intentioned, had racial practices built into it that was perceived as a form of 'murderous' care. For the suicide epidemic, the care there was anonymous, relying mainly on suicide hotlines and 'education campaigns' to convince people to live. In reality, this creates a self-fulfilling prophecy: it doesn't work, doesn't recognise the 'creative imagination' of suicide and doesn't help the Inuit youth.

Care binds the living and the dead. Merely keeping the body alive isn't enough. For the latter half of the book, the ethnographer scopes out how the Inuit consider care beyond the living body. She scopes out several images: names, songs and dreams that shows alternative ways of caring for people.
## A collection of key ideas from the text

### Anonymous, 'murderous' caring of the state

In dealing with the several problems that faced the Canadian Inuit, the Canadian government envisioned multiple solutions. Ultimately though, this form of care 'renders lifeless a people's particular form of life.'

#### **Firstly, let's talk about the tuberculosis epidemic.** (Chapter 1: Facts and Images & Chapter 2: Cooperation)

To calculate the Inuit death total, they were identified with dog ties. Since they had no last names, their identity was confused - people buried them in unmarked graves (25).

In a way, this creates a lingering relationship between seriality, substitutability and animality (27) - as 'muskrats'. The serialization of human bodies was dehumanizing but here the North Administration at times lost sight that the Inuit were anything other than bodies needing care - who was an individual was ignored.

The truth is, it was beyond the facts of the matter that death was concerned. We come to the testimony of Sakiassie who knew that his mother Kaujak was dead, but patiently hung around the ship to hear news of his mother. Facts therein are insufficient and we want something more. There are images here, of Sakiassie unloading cargo and sees his grandmothers photo taken, finding that photo on the wall of his high school, then thereof of the second image of watching Kaujak's boat as it leaves.

```ad-quote
title: About images (37)
So when Sakiassie would go to the beach to listen, perhaps he was not really looking for facts ... that didn't stop him from wanting her, and wanting to feel her presence, to be in touch.
```

The force of these images are what's important. These strange images matter a lot to us, imbue us with a ton of force. The power of our childhood images and experiences can be incredibly strong. Stevenson remarks on Peutagok's story of his chewing gum that his mother gave him: he refers to himself in the first person, but also as a third person: 

```ad-quote
title: About chewing gum (42-43)
"That's why I sometimes get criminal ... it was hurt too" linking his childhood experience, in which the terror of a disappearing mother was condensed in packets of gum he couldn't bear to chew, to an adulthood marked by petty crimes. Something was hurt too much"
```

The Inuit were perceived as a group of people who needed help and were inferior to the Qallunaaq (white people) lives.

```ad-quote
title: About the 'dirty' bodies (50):
To the Qallunaaq mind, "Eskimos" were an astoundingly dirty people, and little any Qallunaat said or did to try to teach the fundamentals of hygiene seemed to make any difference. It was as if Eskimos wouldn't quite be Eskimos any more if they became clean. "Sanitation is unknown to any but a negligible few of the natives," wrote one public health official. "They do not wash, and partly in consequence, skin diseases such as impetigo and ringworm spread quickly among them. They throw food sccraps, fishbones, blood etc., on their shack floors or on the ground in their tents and deposit excreta and other sewage close to their buildings" (Canada, Department of National Health and Welfare 1960: 74).
```

They did this in multiple ways:
They sought to 'educate' the native communities and force patients to 'painstakingly learn to become hygienic, orderly, and dutiful subjects.' (52)
They admitted the Inuit to the sanatoria since the government were ''not convinced that the Unit would be able to comply' and to stop infecting compatriots to the south.
They found out that Inuit don't have last names, so instead they tagged everyone with unique disc numbers to properly calculate them.

This had a psychological toll for several reasons:
The Inuit were terrified of leaving their homes, and since they do not know English they could not express their needs. 
The Inuit were not able to send messages: "hospital administrators could not speak Inuktitut and had no clear sense of Arctic geography" and there were "stories of children being placed instead in foster homes without their parents' permission or knowledge (55)."

Additionally, there is a problem of assisted suicide. Stevenson follows the story of Eerkiyoot and Ishakak who put their mother, Nukashook, to death as she asked. The two men were sentenced to one year in prison as this was against the law.

Stevenson writes:
```ad-quote
title: About euthanasia: (65) 
Exposure to death was now something that the government hoped to control, thereby making Inuit worthy of Canadian citizenship ... Gibson argues that in order to better observe the humanitarian principles central to Canada's postwar image, the government needed to provide for a beter way of life among the Inuit so that the "native" could say, "I don't need to exercise my tribal customs upon my mother or my relatives and bring about merciful deaths; there is a place provided by relatives and bring about merciful deaths; there is a place provided by the government where these people could be looked after" ... [translating] into the increased intervention of the Canadian state in Inuit life.

```

The Inuit were expected to fail before they begin. "The Inuit (from the perspective of the colonial agents) could never quite manage to live up to the standard set by their white counterparts." (66).

This is taken to its extreme with Miriam, a school-age girl who was taken from her home and placed in residential schools to teach her how to 'behave'. She was taught not to speak Inuktitut. Her thigh-long hair was cut off. She notes that:

```ad-quote
title: Melancholy (68)
I was walking home and I fell down and I didn't want to get up. I wanted to fereze to death. Because I was so tired of - you know - just wanting to go home and not being able to. I missed my parents so much. That's all I remember. I don't remember what happened after that.
```

This inevitably leads to the care perceived as murderous. Yatsushiro (71) notes that perhaps after the loose sled dogs were killed, perhaps then the policemen would turn to the Eskimos next.


The author makes it clear of the similarities between Jenness' language for the final solution is to 'liquidate' the Indian problem, an assimilation. Here, people are just a 'thing', dehumanising. (118)

#### The Suicide Epidemic (Chapter 3: Anonymous Care)

The Inuit were perceived as suicidal. "Everyone - all Inuit, that is - has become potentially suicide and in need of counselling." (77)

Viewed in this framework, that all Inuit youth are potentially suicidal, everyday activities are perceived as preventing suicide. Suicide prevention strategies are designed specifically to ensure that nobody is implicated in the death of the counsellor. Bureaucracy here takes place, with an organized plan of steps that once followed, assumes that the counsellor could not have done much.

Thus came the rise of anonymous suicide helplines. This is a distinctly Western idea, as one Inuit elder put it: "As Inuit we hear about confidentiality. There is no such thing for anonymity. We live like a book. Our life is like an open book."  (85)

"The fervour of people within the contemporary suicide apparatus can also be experienced as alienating to youth who are identified by that very apparent  as "at risk"" (93)

Stevenson follows Monica's story. For her, suicide has become one of those teenage behaviours. Likely everyone you know, or will know, has thought about or attempted suicide. The state therein expects the Inuit to commit suicide. When Monica speaks, we must remember that "she has lived her whole life within a postcolonial state that simultaneously bans and anticipates her death, a state that wants her death - if she is going to die - so that it tabulate rates and predict future deaths" (96)

Suicide is intensely monitored and anonymous. Not only has staying alive become a colonial norm that no Inuit can live up to, but "Living seems to require both pain and the taking of risks. It seems to require risking the possibility that one will not stay alive." (96-97) 

Additionally, this in turns generate suicide: "There is a sense of inevitability about Inuit suicide. Inuit youth feel it, and sometimes they resist, asking for their pain to be recognized in a different register. Sometimes, tragically, they play along." (97)

Ultimately, we can summarise this:
"It became evident to me that presuming the value of life, staging it as the ultimate good, could be as dangerous as negating it." (14)

### Alternative ways of envisioning care (Chapter 4-6)

#### Chapter 4: Life-of-the-Name

This chapter relates how the name-soul of a teenager, Isaac, who dies in a snowmobile accident and how his life resides in the baby who carries his name.

Silas' s brother Isaac died. Her best friend Jesse named her child after him so that "the *atiq* (name-soul or "life of the name") would enter the new born child." (105)

Names take on an immortalizing concept, helping to provide a riddle. Stevenson notes her friend Davidee, whose best friend Judah died in a shooting accident. He has a dream about Judah's grandmother and when he visits the house of an old woman, he sees an old boy named after Judah, who has a scar-like blad spot in the place where the bullet killed Judah.

The image of the name is simply important is vital. "In thinking the life-f-the-name as a kind of melancholia or prolonged mourning I am suggesting that the name functions more as an image than as an abstraction" ... "in both dreams and myth, images are 'charged with meaning, but the meanings remain implicit so that the emotions they command seem to be centred on the image rather than on anything it merely conveys." (122)

"The life of a name provides a way of imagining life ... that refuses to ignore the dead ... and that takes very seriously the way we bear the dead along but also calls into question what it is possible  to know for sure." (124)

#### Chapter 5: Why Two Clocks?

Caring for the Inuit became something that "can be measured and evaluated, fed through a system of best practices and evidence-based science - simultaneously becomes invested in a certain way of being in time ... implicit in the system of care is that the object of care must learn to mime the caregiver's attitude to time and to care." (134)

Take residential schools: the people there report that every day, every minute of their lives would be severely controlled. This is a pretty colonial take.

Stevenson writes how the Eskimo people were expected to be "lost". "The longing to be lost, forever, in a geographical space where the "Eskimo" past is written physically by the land ... I will argue a longing to belong differently to time, to have the possibility of building a different relationship to what is, what has been, and what may be." (136)"

For example, she takes the story of a mother, exposing her child to a 'healing camp'  in order to make the Inuit 'learn to long.'

We can take the premise of dreams. Dreams take on a special meaning for the Inuit: they encapsulate an epistemology about who we are and about death. Dreams seem to "compress what is and isn't at the same time" - for Silas, her friend Linda:

```ad-quote
title: About dreams and suicide (140-141)
... was alive, was herself and then after she committed suicide she wasn't alive, wasn't herself. But in the dream she seems to be both at the same time - available and unavailable, herself and not herself, wanting to speak but not able  to.
```

Dreams have a powerful quality to them, making the dead seem really much alive.

```ad-quote
title: About dreams (144)
... the dead in dreams  act on the dreamer, and following the dead of dreams to the places they call the dreamer to go would mnean almost certain death ... you can't say it [that a person is dead] because the dead are alive to the dreamer and can still exert their power over the dreamer's very life. They are alive in some sense.

```

Stevenson regards clocks: the Inuit have two clocks despite not really needing it. A lot of westerners wonder, believing the Inuit to not be fully rational in understanding their needs. The author analyses their own biases, picking apart the strangeness of having two clocks. 

She identifies the two modes of being as colonial versus native. 

```ad-quote
title: Pessimism (147)
"The location of such an Inuit temporality is complex: historically it is located in the memories of a presettlement, and geographically it is found out on the land away from town, but existentially it is carried in the bodies and dreams of Inuit as they live out their lives in what Weber calls the iron cage of modernity."
```

Eskimos lose themselves in time, and in dreams they can live on.

#### Chapter 6: The Song

This tries to envision care through song - an image that recognizes the other is present.

This chapters regards the story of Pauloosie, someone who was charged with arson but had the charges dropped. People thought he was guilty and he was stigmatized as a result.

Stevenson tries to make friends and film an anti-suicide prevention video. Despite having express permission, the video was rejected by the principal as if anything happens the school has to put it through the DEA.

Stevenson talks more about spending time with some youths: watching them write poetry, sing songs, draw. They go to a camping site, Pauloosie borrows a guitar, He states that "my mother looks at me like I'm white." (156).

Stevenson believes that we should have a form of listening of song - obviously about the words of the Inuit, but also of companionship offered that calls for attention and:

```ad-quote
title: About song (156)
"makes space for the existence of another, and thus in a certain sense call that other into being. Singing is not just about mouthing the words to a well-known song. In its simplest sense, tt take song as an invocation that depends less on words per se and more on voice as a kind of gesture."
```

She draws attention to the the life-of-the-name and what this means about being human generally, that our physical life depends on our linguistic life, that there are ways in which we are kept alive through the invocation of our names.

This is the key concept of interpellation: she uses [[Judith Butler]]'s theory to discuss how through hate speech, people can be interpellated into negative roles: how Pauloosie was interpellated into the subject position of arsonist. How negative hate speech related to Pauloose led to his suicide attempt. Interpellation confers intelligibility on the individual through the provision of a subject position to inhabit.

The central new argument: listening can be a form of interpellation.

```ad-quote
title: The power of interpellation (160)
Listening can be a form of interpellation. That is, there are modes of listening, just like modes of speech, that can fix someone, an individual, in a particular subject position ... there is a certain mode  of listening resderved for listening to children, to criminals, to drunks, to kings.
```

This is song - recognizing someone as a human, their potential as company, as lovable kinds of beings that can occupy a space.

**What if dying, and being borne along by those who love you, is also a way of being alive? How might we come to care for life that is constitutively beside itself, life could never be fully itself?**
