Criticise the analytical tool developed by kinship anthropologists as being informed by assumptions about kinship and biology - there is something there that is really interesting and if you want to read a useful summary, "Janet Carsten, introduction to volumes of cultural relatedness" we build on Schneider and mitigate some of the most corrosive aspects of Schneider's critique of kinship that relaunch kinship studies in a different way, she suggests that we substitute the word kinship with relatedness - to open up the analytical lens which to some extent is interesting but also highly contested for various reasons. That volume is super helpful and readable.

The other thing we wanted to highlight, look at the date - we understood certain things in important of certain substances, but we hadn't teased out the theoretical implications of that ethnography - blood symbolism being used in a different way. Whereas for Schneider blood is a symbol of connectiveness, it links people and also separates people who are connected by blood and not connected by blood, and the idea of blood relatives that automatically assumes a biogenetic connection whereas in the Khumbo or Tibetian, idiom of bones that where often the same word is used for the bones in the body, patrilineal clan and this is where the symbolism is really interesting because that word indicates both in one. The substance and the symbolic connection it creates in terms of paternal substance being passed on. So in yeah, bring in ethnographies from home. But in that context sometimes flesh or blood or milk is used as the other side of kinship, less permanent or for example rots away and disappears and often is associated too with a slight devaluation of the maternal side of kinship. It is the paternal line that persists and the other one just simply doesn't exist - a completely different use of kinship.

This tells us that if we have a functionalist analysis - what are we meaning here, from that point of view realizing how culture is situated, some ideas are about biology in kinship and some ideas are not. So you say, and sometimes some of the idiom for blood gets transferred to genes. We attribute to genes a lot of stuff. If we look at genetic models things are very complicated. Yeah, we have the genes of grandpa, and yeah some potentialism, some mental health disorders have a genetic disorder (okay!) but there are some interesting questions in genetic transmission and what is made by genetic substances is very often very culturally situated. We have a lot of reading into that.

*Nikolas says something*

Some of what is used to be argue in terms of blood gets argued in terms of genes in a somewhat inaccurate way. Bur we know there is a shift tin cultural understanding? Well, it depends on who is speaking. If we look at tele-programs and look at what people are discovering about lost brothers and all, sometimes things can be argued in terms of blood. The idiom of blood is still there. It is still powerfully used politically - Xi Jing Ping. Some kind of Chinese diasporic connectiveness. He said, blood is thicker than water. The point that we use is that we don't need to look at blood - sometimes the study is done on blood and stuff - but it has a biased understanding and folk understanding of genetic research in ways in which in popular narratives a lot of things is attributed to genes whereas it is attributed to blood. Same is happening with race. Now, speaking about race is no-no but some of the narratives that come of racist narratives get slightly reframed in line of genes - it is in their genes. It is a popular instrumentally slanted way of talking about genetic.

Nationalist undertones. Should be considered very heavily.

Blood is a very versatile symbol that is open to multiple interpretations. Even within single cultural settings - Tibetan ones - it is really interesting how in Tibetian languages, you may have ideas of blood and bones used to underpin patrilineal communities, matrilineal communities, nonlinearly communities and different systems of kinship.

**You might need to take another look at how kinship talks for social problems.**

We cannot look for a single particular model in how people discuss kinship.

Imagine someone coming here from rural Himalayas and they ask 'how do you marry'. Oh yeah, people here marry boys and girls and produce children. If we can, we buy a house! Then we look at the statistics only the couple who marry is less than those who don't. So... only *some* marry. But the legal system - if you produce the name of the father on the certificate and the 'father' has a similar role to married fathers. Let's look at a general system of rule people are looking at.

Essentially, it's a very complicated picture.

So Schneider was really important in disrupting some of the ambitions of kinship anthropology. So was Nidham who was scathing about debates between functionalism and structuralism. All these debates are 'in the mind of the anthropologist' and have nothing to do with them on the ground.

Janet Carsten is quite helpful. Another thing that can be helpful is **encyclopaedia of anthropology by spencer** and there is a nice essay (two pages long) in which you have a quick summary of how kinship has been understood by anthropologists at various points in time, focused on and how debates have moved over time.

It is very simplistic but it gives us a sense of the debate than us trying to find 'the' definition of kinship. We can also use 'the open encyclopaedia of anthropology' a nice essay by Marilyn or a nice essay on ethnography. 

**Nikolas's turn.** He focused on symbols and his question is why make a distinction between the symbolic and the real? Another interesting essay, not much an ethnography but an essay on the body. He looks at the end of the body and the immune system and how that looks at US systems and knowledge.

The real world and the symbolic means the meaning - isn't there an argument to be made that you can make something the real based on your subjective understanding of the culture you are in (Nik) and build a framework? Establish a framework of context where you are moving in.

It can be challenging to build up a framework - it may work in a context and not in another. We had to look and touch (in regards to her own birth) in that if it runs a bell. Despite the difference, this shows that she had different coloured hair, different coloured eyes. We recognise the human body.

What is the real here? In the sense that you call it adoption. Whether Barbara's people would call it adoption. Can we argue another interesting case. Rebecca Emerson, we look at a village and a house where a child died in the fire. It was the only child of that couple.
