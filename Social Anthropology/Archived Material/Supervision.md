Contextualise that: there is an assumption of they haven't been.

Strong emphasis on the rules - how will they marry, how will they pass on political rules. Structuralism too.

Study of kinship connected to experience people where having in kinship practices, looking at contrasts between practices and rules (Bourdieu). So, in many ways there has been increasing interest in that dimensions.

This comes to be significant in the way of challenging some assumptions about love and lust - the assumptions about the West and the rest. In which love and the rest are not explained.

What I'm saying for anthropologists in strong interest to interrogating love - whilst there is an assumption of romantic love and marriage and Western societies.

Ideas with love are associated with modern liberal subject, engaging with a whole host of relationships that are driven by certain values. This individual who chooses where to marry as opposed of choosing who to marry.

Lots of arranged marriage where romantic love did not matter at all. If you have an arranged marriage, it's about among households and kinship groups. These kids fall in group, it's capricious, get themselves in trouble and you need people with experience.

Rationale: with romantic love you need a certain type of individual and understanding that the individual can make certain choices and engage in certain practices. Prohibited love, complicated love stories.

There is an assumption that marriages should have been based on an individual commitment. When you have the marriage ceremony, you have a man and woman taking vows as long as they live. At some point.

Choose how to love and how to embark on a union seemed out of reach - a product of Western modernity.

In may ways, people started to discover that in actuality these people could experience feelings that exist in another setting. You have love songs, you have narratives about the experience of commitment to each other and so that basically love marriages - to what an extent can they seen as a basis for marriage can be seen as another thing.

Complicate expectations in Western society where you can have all kinds of different situations.

Reflects a stereotype of how love should be.

Experience - to some extent, developing a variety of arguments. Really state and clarify the main argument in my argument. A clear argument is missing - we need to list.

Facets of human experience neglected by earlier approaches.

Stronger introduction - contextualising this in the history of anthropology, earlier approaches didn't pay much attention to these experiences of love and lust because the focus was more on rules, classifications and other things. This increased attention to other things make it possible to cast light on recent things.

Western countries - try and make sure not to too general.
