Problems:
Firstly with an introduction - to make an argument work effectively, I need to structure it in a clear way, being a bit more selective on what to focus on.

## **Let's start with the one on Global Health Crises are not just about health: I use an interesting word, 'care.'**

Care is an interesting word to create the argument I'm trying to make in the sense that care is a concept that has been used in anthropology of kinship in analytical lens.
If we look at the readings of lecture 4, there is quite a bit said about care.

It's a word we find in regards to the idea of healthcare system, social care system, We could elevate this 'care' to an  interesting framework of analysis to understand the global health crisis and not just about health - care is something that we find at times produced and managed by states, or even non-state actors and agencies (NGOs) but in actuality the regionality of care we find in inclusive practices, as a mother caring for her baby, or preparing breakfast because they 'care.'

It's a word associated with positive values, we do things because we 'care'. We use it in a way that contrasts with a self-centred general focus of interests... 'we care for others' and it has interesting positive moral connotations and has an interesting complicated meanings of state or quasi-state institutions where care is provided institutionally.

In the case of health care systems, a process of healing managed in the family, where we need expert assistance in addressing particular illnesses and conditions.

Essentially, care has many different meanings and quite different moral implications according to the activities. I should define, interrogate it and contextualise it.

The idea that we can use care in many different ways as an analytical anthropology in kinship, we should definitely look at lecture 4.

If we engage with the category of care, we can see how people connect with categories of care - how it is elicited by NGOs, institutions and kinship practices. What is interesting in the case of health, the term care is related to how institutions are providing assistance in terms of expertise, but also support - a health care system is something that provides knowledge, tools, caring people who have an ailment.

From this point of view, we can see one possible argument, but when I see this argument (Hildegard) I should contextualise this idea of care, and through bureaucratic practices, may reflect colonial legacies and end up creating unwanted outcomes that are completely unintended and undesirable.

If I engage with the word 'care' as an analytical phrase, I can make my argument clearer and holds everything together. We can use the signposting to refer back to that main argument.

Intuitively, it is all there but I can work towards making it clearer, and making an argument that clearly states the argument. "Global health crises aren't just about health but are host to a series of cultural and global crises. Care is central to understanding that." Health crises involves a wider range of crises.

COVID-19 tried to prevent death ... but what was the concern of the government was not the health care system completely collapsing. What it seems to be in terms of ethnographies I bring to here is that we can highlight of cases that show how this health crises aren't just about health, but care implemented within certain institutions and projects and certain whatever, sometimes having non-intended outcomes.

**Read the question carefully and meditate on it. Contextualise my arguments.**

If it is at the heart of my argument, I can say a working definition - I'm using care according to a working definition by X, or the analytical framework developed by Y, we can connect care to a wider debate or people who defined it in a certain way.

Questioning the validity - not really 'valid' but what I challenge the conclusions. What I am questioning is not the ethnography but her conclusion and the ways in which this conclusion can be applied.

What I mean is through particular aims.

Bring it in in what ways does this ethnography say something that support or counter the argument I was making. If I am critiquing something relevant to that, then that is perfectly fine.

Don't bring up ethnographies in terms of true or false, bring in that critique by contextualising ethnographies, or use ethnographies to counter or not: "The language of Malinowski reflects the time he was writing but nonetheless some of his observations and conclusions can be made a 100 years later."

My critique is perfectly doable, but make it relevant - whether it is good what she does, whether we can inspire a several approach, lessons learnt can be exported, two separate things. Very steep curve - there are at least two different concepts here if not more.

Basically, we see intuitively a lot of stuff works but I should focus on the clarity of language.

For SAN essays, don't focus on the word count - focus on clarity. Next time, forget about the word count. Then, once I can write an essay, we can discuss how it might be reduced. However, we write a word count by writing more and then cutting down, choosing the key points - in terms of the process.

## We move onto Schneider

Introduction - not just a list, the way in which the things hold together have a reason, so Schneider claims that blood is a symbol standing for another symbol.

It understands blood with a code of practices, moral expectations - blood is not just a biological substance, it does a lot of other things - it is a symbol and it stands for biology, which also stands for a symbol.

Looking at ideas of blood relatives that we are connected by biology, and in laws that we are connected through social relatives.

This idea of biology is cultural inherently. Basically, the way in which blood works as a symbol is that it is understood as a biological link but it is culturally situated. Then, he argues that if in American kinship blood is used as a symbol of biological benefits through procreation, this also works for the anthropologists as they come from a Euro-American system and the idea that we have blood relatives. Everything is a cultural construct and the argument a critique of Kinship comes about.

Hildegard's ethnography: the blood in Schneider's blood made the difference between kin associated with procreation and the other ways, the in-laws. For the Khumbo, the blood stands for the maternal side of kinship - the child is produced from the bones coming from the father and blood from the mother. The kin group associated with it is defined through blood and bone, defined completely differently for Schneider. For the Khumbo, blood stands for non-paternal relatives.

Schneider: a difference between kin and kin by law. In both cases we have symbolic use of blood but the way that it is used is quite different. Other substances can be used - milk relatives, wet nurses, milk siblings that share a type of connectedness through that sharing of the substance.

Once we start to have the radical critique of Schneider is that all we understand about biology is that it is culturally situated, there is nothing that is natural then Janet Carsten suggests the otherwise - that we have to find other ways of engaging with anthropology, and thus we need to move to relatedness. One idea of reincarnation - Hildegard gives an example of the Mongolian child of Rebecca Ebson in relation to Mongolian children. The story goes that in a village, there is a house and that house destroyed in a fire. The only child died in that family. A while later, a neighbouring household gives birth to a child with a lot of marks.

It is that child returning, just missed its ways and was given to a family that has lost their child. If we look at the nature of American ways of kinship - that's adoption. If we look at Buddhist styles, it is just a child finding its own households, related through reincarnation.

Forms of care transcends kinship transcends the power of biological connections. In Tibetan society, we consider the children of the house. The framework of organisation there was the household.

Schneider wanted to consider the symbolic importance of blood as a symbol of biological connectedness but that biological connectedness was culturally situated and was linked through links of procreation but this was privileged in American systems but was not a universal way of considering it.

Janet Carsten offers relatedness and talks a lot with substances and sharing food, offering other ways of imagining relatedness.
