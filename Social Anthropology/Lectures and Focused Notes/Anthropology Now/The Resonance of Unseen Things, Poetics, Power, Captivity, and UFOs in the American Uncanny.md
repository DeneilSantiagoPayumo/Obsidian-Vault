## Before we continue
### What is it about?

```ad-summary
_The Resonance of Unseen Things_ offers an ethnographic meditation on the “uncanny” persistence and cultural freight of conspiracy theory. The project is a reading of conspiracy theory as an index of a certain strain of late 20th-century American despondency and malaise, especially as understood by people experiencing downward social mobility. Written by a cultural anthropologist with a literary background, this deeply interdisciplinary book focuses on the enduring American preoccupation with captivity in a rapidly transforming world. Captivity is a trope that appears in both ordinary and fantastic iterations here, and Susan Lepselter shows how multiple troubled histories—of race, class, gender, and power—become compressed into stories of uncanny memory.

“We really don’t have anything like this in terms of a focused, sympathetic, open-minded ethnographic study of UFO experiencers. . . . The author’s semiotic approach to the paranormal is immensely productive, positive, and, above all, resonant with what actually happens in history.”  
—Jeffrey J. Kripal, J. Newton Rayzor Professor of Religion, Rice University

“Lepselter relates a weave of intimate alien sensibilities in out-off-the-way places which are surprisingly, profoundly, close to home. Readers can expect to share her experience of contact with complex logics of feeling, and to do so in a contemporary America they may have thought they understood.”  
—Debbora Battaglia, Mount Holyoke College

“An original and beautifully written study of contemporary American cultural poetics. . . . The book convincingly brings into relief the anxieties of those at the margins of American economic and civic life, their perceptions of state power, and the narrative continuities that bond them to histories of violence and expansion in the American West.”  
—Deirdre de la Cruz, University of Michigan

**Susan Lepselter** is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Anthropology and American Studies at Indiana University.

"What I do look at here is how the question of the real is constantly deconstructed in the discourse itself. People talk about a space that slides between "memory" and "dream," subverting the discrete borders of the real.

And so the stories here are the real object. They are performative, a form of verbal art. Through this, we suggest how the story, the sinister, the traumatic and the disintegrated can recuperate sociability and meaning.

"My voice opens up a play of reported speech, poetic ventriloquism."

"One of its effects in poetry is a feeling of heightened significance that transcends the referential sense of words themselves. In the uncanny, what might be thought of as “rhyme” or even “groove” (Feld 1994) occurs through repetition with variation with other stories and images. And in the uncanny, a similar experience of just-glimpsed parallels and heightened significance moves urgently toward its “something more,” toward a just glimpsed “secret meaning."
```

 ```ad-quote
title: 28
The number story creates the poetic effect of a rhyme, a repetition with variation, a combination, a parallel. And so an underlying order, a “paradigm” or “grammar” of meaning is intimated. First there is my own, lurking in my own private stock of weird things; and then another pattern emerges, and accelerates my own memory into the shared, patterned, circulating ield of the social. There was an immediate assumption in the group that our private numbers, added together, would get us closer to the larger pattern. For repetition with variation produces not just a sense of formal aesthetic pleasure, but even more seductively and urgently, the intense feeling of meaningfulness, the engine of uncanny discourse’s social life.

title: Tom's story: 36, 37
The aliens are summoned to presence by the story, and they begin, through performative language, to occupy the room with us. There they are; in the present tense, he says, “They’re there.” In the present tense he says, “There’s nothing I can do about it.” And we feel it. Even with Sharlyn’s attempt to defuse the discomfort with humor, we listeners are caught up in the troubled feeling Tom’s story conjures into the room ... it performs the hypnotic power to collapse discrete borders between an original “event” and its recollection. It collapses the distinction between the form and the content of narrative. There are multiple collapses enacted here. At the height of the story Tom describes his body this way: “the area where he started to tingle . . .” Is this “he” the alien, who is actively “tingling” Tom’s body—an unusual use of “tingling,” like tickling—or is the “he” Tom himself, disassociated, seeing himself from the outside? This kind of pronominal ambiguity happens in times of disassociation, in trauma or trance (cf. Urban 1989). Sometimes in that altered state you see yourself from the outside.

As always in the uncanny, the foundation of the real is here a shifting ground. What’s real in this story is the conspiracy theory’s dense figuring toward meaningfulness among blanched-out histories. Something is wrong, but no one knows what. No one talks about power as class in these stories, nor as a national foundation of slavery and the genocide at the base of American colonization . . . but disturbing free-floating after-images of enslavement and colonization remain, gathering in distorted forms, in discourses from people with no direct birthright to those traumatic histories. These stories don’t explain anything. They find cracks in the order of things, then wedge themselves into the cracks and shape them with the resonance of other stories.

"On the sliding American uncanny landscape, the real is not what you can finally prove but what you *just know*." - (45)

When the captor is the savage, the trauma of coninement is dramatized in the captive’s experience. The captivity is a clearly marked ordeal, with discrete points that mark its narrative beginning and end. But when the captor is the state itself, then its acts of containment are told through images of paternal or civic benevolence: health, sanitation, progress, enlightenment.

The fallout of the still-open wound of Native American colonization and genocide drifts into space alien stories. Guilt and confusion and injury sometimes survive the fading of their overt material referents, become uncanny emotional tropes, loat into varied patterns of discourse and experience, and give impact and weight to other stories about inscrutable power, and loss.
```

It is not easy to think of the UFO abduction story as symbolically about the history of American conquest. Instead, it's one way that the captivity narrative points to other social memories. 

```ad-quote

What might it mean that memory is not the “equivalent of experience?” On a simple level memory is, of course, imperfect, mutable; it cannot transparently represent objective events. But “experience” itself includes fantasy and imagination, even in the most materially grounded, well-documented event, and therefore Sturken’s idea can go further. Memory “exceeds experience” also because it can transcend the individual “owner” of the actual experience. Once even a private memory circulates—as utterance, narrative, discourse—it becomes social (Bakhtin 1984; Urban 1996). It escapes ownership and becomes a living, growing, changing thing. Then even those who didn’t “have” the original experience can still take in and “have” the memory, absorb it as a kind of inner speech—and can alter it, transform it, let it express new, latent meanings that outrun and distort the transparent sense of the original experience.

"Mostly I think about the unspoken stories of class and its damages, both in the enormous, work-related damages to the body, and in the little everyday injuries that gather up in their own unsayable patterns. Together they shape a felt sense of the real. I want to suggest how tropes from “factual” captivity narratives collude with fantasy and personal experience. " (55)

What I’m getting at here is the metaphoric poignancy in this helmet’s bit of concrete magic. It signiies a protest, however fragile or marginal it might appear, voiced by the residual age of making a clearly usable thing. As with Tom’s dynamo in chapter 1, here the invisible, untraceable encounter with the alien points to the charged mechanical objects; these are crafts and tools that lag a vanishing age of visible production. The helmet’s power to block the alien depends on the value the workingman places on his craft (for Mr. Menkin insists he’s not out for proits; he is not a capitalist, not an entrepreneur but rather a maker, sharing his bricolage for free with other like-minded abduction- resisters, his neighbors on earth).

In one sense, aliens conjure an image of postmodern power that seems to move in transmissions free of material constraints. It’s a mode of power made manifest in connections and networks rather than in clear material production, a power that we are told endlessly accrues in “lows” instead of “goods” in the neoliberal age. And yet the helmet insists, with its precarious victory, the alien mode is still itself hostage to the vanishing power of the ordinary material thing.

In the Hills’ case, many stories that began to comprise the genre were forgotten and recovered to memory later. In these stories, memory itself became the subject of a secondary captivity story: memory was stolen away, converted in captivity with false images or “screen memories,” then through the help of professionals, released. But even while memory was held in captivity, strange fears and feelings remained behind as traces. Detached from their own referents but pointing toward them though a dense ield of semiotic distractions, mysterious signs of the trauma mimic the cultural process of uncanny memory itself. You could redeem the abducted memory-of-abduction by patching together the eerie hints and traces. Then, through hypnosis, the recovered trauma was funneled into a single narrative from the amorphous low of impressionistic feeling. Through hypnosis the therapist could go into the scene of the captivity, taking the abductee along on an inner journey to relive the experience. The story, this way, became a codiied type, and the teller’s original amnesia of that story was one of its key motifs. Here you can see that the UFO abduction story is itself a trace in the life of the social, an uneasy sign pointing to a half-forgotten disturbance beyond the individual’s story. In social life as on the body of an abductee, “horror leaves its traces” in strange, eerie events (Comaroff and Comaroff 2000). But what is that “something,” what is that original horror?

"Yes, these are real names and real places. And yet thrust into the charged and fantastic narrative, with its constant begging for the reading of clues, the names become signs that underscore the theme of a troubled unspoken history." (66) "As signs, the place-names point to a something; and on one level at least that something is the apophenia in accumulated stories of invasion. In the dreamlike story of alien captivity, the polysemous quality of signs begins to pulse with the uncanny light of meaningful fluke. The details seem to refer to something urgent but obscure." (67)#

"Everything here signiies a real beyond itself, for early colonial captivity narratives took seed and grew within a larger climate of seventeenth-century stories, testimonials that matter-of-factly incorporated accounts of the supernatural, and stories whose strange manifestations could easily be compatible with truth claims." (69)

"Here the uncanny emerges as a struggle between the rational and the haunted, between the clearly known and the unbelievable. And it is connected inevitably to an absence: to an inchoate sense of a larger story that is not being told but is leaking into the picture—to a “missing time” that becomes inner speech and inner spectacle." (74)

"This is how uncanny conspiracy theory builds, sign by mimetic sign, until your sense of where you stand is multiple and simultaneous too—invader and invaded, captive and captor." (75)

Always in such seemingly free-loating, autodidactical, uncanny talk, there’s a feeling of another kind of captivity afoot. It’s felt in a kind of intensity that burns its way through that talk. Talking and talking, the words built structures and ladders, the way prayers themselves seem to make a presence in a little church. The words in Carla’s living room and everywhere she dove into conversation tried to break out of some invisible, ineffable constraint. Therefore it is true that this sort of talk is never really about real Native people who struggle with racism or classicism or the fallouts genocide, nor with any of the other ordinary insults of life that you, too, know when you leave this set apart world of uncanny talk. Instead it’s about lost potential. It becomes part of a single ield of disenfranchisement and cosmology, and it all gets wrapped up in talk of UFOs. Histories of colonization and the naturalized expectations of class come together then in a comprehensive structure of feeling and imagination, to combine in a unifying theory of power, of being trapped, and the potential for redemption.

For Randall, the source of enslavement is too vast, too deep to point to as one single thing. He is compelled to try to understand the powers that he knows exist but that no one can ever really pin down. What he feels has happened cannot be solely linked, for him, to the legacy of American slavery that gives him his emotional metaphor, or just to colonization. It is not just the tropes of dreadful medicalization leaking in from images of Nazi doctors or pictures of animal experimentation, or mysterious animals cut in the desert like experiments, or the inchoate feelings of disempowerment in ordinary encounters with power when you don’t have the cultural capital to feel at ease within them (see Lareau 2003). And it is not just his, or anyone’s, youthful experience of the containments in hard times. He layers it up: the resonance that emanates from many half-remembered signs, letting him know that there is more to power than what meets the eye.

Stories of freedom and independence weave into the fabric of who you are, standing up to a government that tries to worm in and pull you down. They try to make you weak by refusing to help in the way that would work with your own ierce abilities. Instead they try to usurp your autonomy with a cunning gentle force, to chip away at the pride you rightly have in all you could do without them. That’s what they were still doing, up there, taking over people’s bodies, and making their evil deals with unworldly powers that be.

For the rational, no- nonsense rancher, and for the area’s fabulous conspiracy theorists alike, environmentalism was a word with a dark, strange aura. The EPA was an agency that tried to control policy on the open range. Its policies viewed the land as public in many ways, required to expand its use beyond grazing into such public uses as national parks. Conservative constituencies in the West traditionally clashed with both the EPA and the BLM for economic reasons. But in story, for some people who had no direct economic interest in the potential development of land, those acronyms also had become a kind of fantastically demonic emblem of the powers that be and its dominion over land; it was an enemy of the individual, and a right arm of the New World Order that would subsume you in its wake. People often talked about the EPA, not mentioning speciic policies but letting the sound of the initials resonate with an implicit, amorphously sinister implication.

Some people want empirical evidence of UFOs. "But empirical finality is not what drives the support group. Here the ground you explore is part of your own experience that you can’t tell anyone else—the middle-of-the-night memories, the synchronicities, the strange small face that you could never shake, the feeling that might just have been a dream. Or sometimes you retell stories you’ve heard, giving them extra weight when they’re told in the context of the group, letting weird things begin to add up." (118)

"Opening this genred space to speak about the weird sparks a capacity to remember things. Memories it the open shape you are given here. As I sit on my metal folding chair, ambiguous images ill my mind and I begin to remember things from childhood. It was not that I had ever forgotten them, I felt, but here they were, gleaming in my mind’s eye. A vague sense of a disturbance would shape itself into potential story form." (126)

Nature here is spoken as a site of nostalgia, a lost home.

Why is this prophecy of a white man from Kentucky a montage of these specific tropes in which the Satan of boyhood sermons is infused with still-restless images of slavery and concentration camps, co-articulating signs of some unnamed power watching *the little man* through the all-seeing-eye of the dollar.

"When it works, the agreement to move without anxiety inside a licensed realm seems natural for those whose imagined community includes the “we” of the representative-based state. Yet for those who don’t feel part of the franchise, this ordinary zone of sanctioned freedom feels strange. Bureaucratic signs and procedures grow fabulous charged with overdetermined meaning; and the conflict between law and freedom, which is supposed to remain unmarked, can grow uncanny in its emergent visibility. The source of power is felt to be simultaneously hyper present and hidden. And its conflicts are expressed in a struggle for something like poetic license, which takes the real itself as the site of struggle." (148-149).

The uncanny carries a sense of the liminal, not as a transition in a linear progression to a new reintegrated state but rather as particular “structure of feeling” (Williams 1977). But while the uncanny is experienced as something “lodged between” the spaces of code, it is also completely saturated by “the rules of law,” not outside them. But in the light of an uncanny space, naturalized rules almost appear to be what they are— rules, conventions, constructions. As Turner (1979, 1981) wrote of the liminal (and also of the “liminoid” [1981], its more naturalized form) this space breaks down code into its parts. The parts loom out of order and become grotesque. They acquire the horror of taboo in Mary Douglas’s (1966) classic sense of the term—things out of place that threaten a naturalized order. Douglas recognized that such ambiguity is not only the basis of taboo but also of creativity; “the richness of poetry depends on [it] . . . aesthetic pleasure arises from the perceiving of inarticulate forms” (37).

In the uncanny, the naturalized “indicative mood” of the ordinary grows contingent with its own “subjunctive” latent critique. Things as they are indicated in naturalized terms threaten to fall apart. Like poetry, they are glimpsed in their constitutive parts, often through repetition, or the intensiication of tropes. But if they were to appear fully as conventions, they would no longer be uncanny. Their double-voicing through repetition and parallelism would be fully consciously crafted, politically rich, poetic critiques, rising out of a consciously artful and participatory social identity, speaking in its relation to a dominant other. But in the double-voiced, poetic decomposition of the uncanny, such critical denaturalization isn’t ever fully complete. It remains half articulated, a kind of “partial knowledge” (Petryna 2002).
```

"The weird, overdetermined feeling here can give us insight into other contingent American desires, a projected longing for a something that is not fulfilled. This desire can wind up taking multiple directions in affects surrounding encounters with power, from right-wing, antigovernment conspiracy to the liberatory; it wants to live on the other side, whatever that is, and hopes there is some different kind of force lurking there, beyond the ache of any ordinary life made captive by powers that always seem too overwhelming to pin down to a single story." (159)
