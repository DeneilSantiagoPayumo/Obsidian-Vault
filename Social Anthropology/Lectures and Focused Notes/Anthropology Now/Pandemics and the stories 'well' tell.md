## Lecture information:

```ad-tldr
Today we'll explore how the semiotic ideologies surrounding pandemics shape and are shaped by the ethical and political values in a given society.

Through thinking in this way about global health crises, we will make visible the patterns and connections between historical and contemporary pandemic outbreaks and their influence on human behaviour and social structures.

## Lecture notes:

Semiotic ideology meets epidemiology: "has general semiotic processes to specific judgements of ethical and political value: t take a sign a certain way is to take seriously the world it presupposes and, often, the life that the world recommends." (Keane, 2018:1)

"The proliferation of health content on mainstream and social media, the rise of telemedicine (which is getting a COVID-19 boost), the rise of electronic media records, the co-production of 'new' drugs and devices by scientists, clinicians, media and advertising professionals, and journalists from molecule to blockbuster, and myriad other phenomena should signal us that SARS-Cov-2 is not unprecedented in being as much 'communicative' as 'medical'. (Briggs, 2020:570)"

This lecture is about the story we tell about global health crises. We see grand narratives pop up in instances like pandemics we should examine repetition.

## Responsibility

Diagram - curves: did not count certain people who weren't registered.  How we read data means reading how we understand to be part of a nation, part of a crisis.

The advice - washing your hands. That was a big one. That is something that came back again and again and again. Of course we wash our hands to maintain hygiene but the responsibility of washing hands come on us to make sure we weren't touching surfaces, to wash our hands, to buy hand sanitizer, to wear gloves.

Washing hands is possible for everybody... but what about the homeless, people living in precarity. What if there was no soap, no hand sanitizer, no water? That's just a way to think about this.

There are patterns: we already know it, can attend to.

## Heroes and Villains

Animal 'Villains'?
"Riguelle has shown that, in the course of the seventeenth century, concerns with 'noxious' animals played an important role in instituting limits of where these could be kept and where they could be allowed to roam in urban environments." (Lynteris, 2019:4)"

Human Animal Super-Spreaders:
"Our findings support European data indicating the exportation of COVID-19 cases from a cluster in Ischgi. The aprex-ski bar where the first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Ischgl worked as a barkeeper was reportedly the source of many of the cases later detected in Iceland, Norway and Denamark."

The story became paramount - people washing their vegetables despite the virus being airborne.

Infection outbreaks are unlikely to point to a strange coincidence but rather a strong connection between different global behaviours and the increase in disease relevance.

Super-spreader events are considered to be a way for COVID-19 to be spread. The way it was being interpreted was about people who perceived this, not people in power - there was much more focus based on not using your car, not going outside in your local car.

"While emergent pathogens are components of nature, their appearance among humans and their health and social impacts are mediated by microsocial processes embedded within large-scale inegalitarian social structures..." (Singer / Slinger?)

## Masks

There was this huge issue around Muslim women wearing hijabs and burkas. Then - masks came. It was not perceived as viable and the ideological schema wasn't available world-wide.

Within the US, people were actively encouraged to stop buying masks. If we talk about masks in a social context, masks are both a form of enhancement and obfuscation - changing makeup, changing your face, 'hiding what is underneath'.

It is a pattern underneath it.

Rats are so ~~disgusting~~ heroic. Rats are noted to spread the black death. Also there was covering about rats finding landmines or 'hero' rats detecting COVID-19.

Subjugation - if you understand how people use space, then you can manipulate it. Understanding - hierarchy of how people use states. It's not that the pandemics was coming through proximity, but we can see hierarchies played in the stories we tell.

'The Curve' - anatomo politics, management of death. People in nursing homes were closed off and not protected in the ways that they were supposed to do. There was discourse when the great report that there was a report about letting people die. 

A form of regulation by the state - regulation apps. It also exists by government regulation: these are state mandated and biopolitics leads to anatomo politics, politics of death.

Communicative past of cheek kissing, pandemic ongoing discourse, governments mobilizing, moving away from simple binaries to more than that. We move to locked down bodies. 

The point in wrapping things up is that there is an article an anthropologist (name?) called "the curve" in mapping these patterns that peaked. Whatever we do now, we should think about the next pandemic. Now we have a recent memory of it, we may see the same lapses and assertations of it happens.

It is the 'dark side of globalization'. There is already identified as vulnerable, identified in a precarious position - place disproportionate responsibility on people. The violation of the structurally violated and poor, an ever-present possibility of conflict... The COVID-19 pandemic shows that public health places disadvantages on disadvantages people.

Most bureaucrats and middle class simply do not understand the poor and do not calculate variations in their modelling. The COVID-19 pandemic.
