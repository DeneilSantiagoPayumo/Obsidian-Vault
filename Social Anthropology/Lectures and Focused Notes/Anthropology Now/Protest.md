## Lecture information:

```ad-abstract
Why?
It's pretty contemporary.
Protest is something interesting to the lecturer. In America, in the early 2000s, we saw an awful lot of protests. There's been waves of neoliberalism, against free market policies, in favour of indigenous rights. They've been followed by waves of right wing backlashes. It's complicated.

This is in fact (on the screen) a union protest against policies of the president of Argentina who celebrates himself as an 'anarcho-capitalist' and is trying to impose strong free-market policies and attack labour rights. That's what the unions have got themselves out on the street for. 

Latin America is not awash with protest politics, a form of routine politics where this becomes the dialogue people communicate in. I want to argue that protests are as important as institutional and electoral politics, knowing about legislation, parliamentary commitees, anything like that.

These protests are difficult to research because of the unpredicatability. Let's start with analytical strategies and then talk about experience.

## Lecture notes:

## Analytical Strategies

One ways we think about protests as an analytical strategy for approaching the ideas of protest is to think about protests as:

1. (Protests as) diagnostic of broader questions (political, economic, cultural, social)

We can see this with BLM - it crystalises objects about what we want, desire, effects of institutional policies. With Argentina, we can see this with effects of inflation, with how people think about politics. We can look at any protest, any riot and unpick the contextual parts that make it come into being.

We can also look at protest as:

2. . (Protests as) events - objects of research in themselves

Not wider questions of politics and culture, but objects of analysis. **This is what we're focusing in right now**. Let's use the anthropology of religion to the anthropology of politics. Objects, symbols, used in all kinds of protest. One of those symbolic tropes is the flags - how flags come to symbolise a kind of proposal for patriotism, nationalism, for the defence of the public in this case.


## Meaning

Visual intertextuality - repetition. For example, the repetition of a technique using a tennis racket to bat away tear gas.

These ideas come from all over kinds of places - protestors think about what they can do, and share information. It is not that it is effective to bat away tear gas with a tennis racket but that it means something symbolically.

Let's look at the protest of Chile in the Feminist collective Las Tesis. The lecturer plays a video (no audio!). They're doing the same sort of movements across Barcelona, Berlin, and more. We can look at it later, she cuts it off. What she thinks we can see is the power of the ritual collective repeated action in how political programs are articulated.

"It wasn't my fault, not where I was, nor what I wore" - these protests.

They point to different elements that constitute to rape, and it comes to what they're protesting: rape, judges. It is not a personal and moral violation, but a systemic problem.

We've got the symbolic repetition and the ways things (information) travel. The way the women back down is akin to how people bow down for police. Let's look at Bolivia - and the lecturer's experience and her work, the dance, the parade and the demonstration.

## Experience

Lazar (the lecturer) - 2015: look for similarities in physical form, aesthetic of forward movement in unity, collective political agency.

Unfortunately, the video is not working. Again.

We can see their dance - what this dance involves is the chains of the slaves in colonial times that were brought to the silver mines. This is a bigger version of the same dance. What's important to see is that the aesthetic of the forward movement in that community.

It's a dance particularly associated with successful business people. These people are dancing in the city of La Paz and they're

We move to a school parade in the founding of the city of Bolivia. We can see how the school children, young people moving and dancing and creating music together. We can see i as a band. We can see it a celebration of the moment of the civic - the different departments of Bolivia. It's a national celebration and again, the gender differentiated groupigns.

The boys in one groups and the girls go in another group.

We have got to move forward together, forward motion in a sort of the ranks.
This is something that school children as socialised int at a young age. This is a sort of the same demonstration (in another video) we can see the group of people waving indigenous flag, the red blue and green with the Bolivian flag. 

Protests (another video) are quite similar. This is a protest for a public university. Each grouping is indicated by the banner at the beginning. The three practices look like the civic parade, the civic parade looks like a dance. It looks like a serious political end of the demonstration.

It does not work to just call it a continuum of practices. There's elements of fun in the demonstration, as well as elements of serious devotions in the dance. What happens is that through citing the civic parade, the fiesta of the zone is a moment of celebration and a moment of drinking and partying over about three days.

It's about fun! It's about coming together! The demonstration sights the parade, sights the dance, and it makes a claim to its legitimacy as a political action. This is what we do on independence day, devotion to the state. It is not outrageous, mainstream - it is correct. Going the other way, it has a subversive potential too - it can become something excessive.

It's an important experience as acting part of a collective. It's something school children come to learn about, and are socialised too from the beginning. Politics is about collectivity, about neighbourhood groups, negotiate with the state.

## Collectivity

- Communitas ([[Victor and Edith Turner]])

```ad-quote
‘Communitas often appears unexpectedly. It has to do with the sense felt by a group of people when their life together takes on full meaning. … Communitas is a group’s pleasure in sharing common experiences with one’s fellows.’ [1-2]
Edith Turner, Communitas. The Anthropology of Collective Joy, 2012
```

We'll come back to this in my lecture next week about truth and disinformation on the internet.

- Collective effervescence ([[Emile Durkheim]])

```ad-quote
‘… religion remains the object of a certain delirium. What other name can we give to that state when, after a collective effervescence, men believe themselves transported into an entirely different world from the one they have before their eyes?’ [226]

‘… every feast, even when it has purely lay origins, has certain characteristics of the religious ceremony, for in every case its effect is to bring men together, to put the masses into movement and thus to excite a state of effervescence, and sometimes even of delirium, which is not without a certain kinship with the religious state. A man is carried outside himself and diverted from his ordinary occupation and preoccupations. Thus the same manifestations are to be observed in each case: cries, songs, music, violent movements, dances, the search for
excitants which raise the vital level, etc.’ [383]

Emile Durkheim, Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, 1915 (these citations are specifically from the 2008 Dover edition, translated by Joseph Ward Swain)
```

-  Common moral economy. ([[E.P. Thompson]])

```ad-quote
It is of course true that riots were triggered off by soaring prices, by malpractices among dealers, or by hunger. But these grievances operated within a popular consensus as to what were legitimate and what were illegitimate practices in marketing, milling, backing, etc. This in its turn was grounded upon a consistent traditional view of social norms and obligations, of the proper economic functions of several parties within the community, which, taken together, can be said to constitute the moral economy of the poor.’ [78-9]

E. P. Thompson, The Moral economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century, 1971
```

She will never forget the October 2023 protest of La Paz and a Brazilian sociologist described it as a "euphoria of democracy."

It's a theory of collective action and crowds. (Zoned out a bit (PC crashed) but she talks about an article on the Peru Protest (in the reading list!)

This is relevant today (the quote) because many protests *do* turn to riots. Look at the 2011 riots in London, a protest over policing and brutality. It moved into a moment of generalized protests leading to riots. None of us probably remember it, but we can look at the discussion of the Uprising TV series. People were accused of being looters, dismissed as irrational desperate actors.

So riots might seem to be a bursting out of emotion but what E.P Thompson points to is that there's certain logics and animated ideas about what is proper.

In reality, little about this is spontaneous and little about this is unique. It is no coincidence. People in the trade union told the lecturer talked about how they joined protests with their mom and dad. They grew up with this experience.

It's about militancy, it's about sacrifice - look at [[Carwil Bjork-James]] in his study of the Bolivian protest. There is a risk of violent-ness about the state. Can we talk about the destruction of property in confronting the state in this way?

It can become part of a routinised protest about stress - people are making themselves vulnerable by the state. If we want to read more about this we can look at this.

We can look at people winning the world cup, and taking to the streets - going where people are to protest and to celebrate. This is highly reflective across time in a year later, something people are consciously trying to emulate.

1. We should be wary of viewing protest as a wistful response to distress as in effect it is about minimizing that distress
2. Or looking at the protest as an excuse of violence that is often racialized.

It is not just a dialogue between the states that's calm and peaceful and assertive - it can be those things, but it can also be about repression and violence. What it is not is that it is not illogical. It is not uncontrolled. It's meaningful. Protests are politically and culturally writ events amenable to a lot of society. To what they say about the state, to the ways in which symbols have these meanings, the interplay between physical meanings and social & political effects.
