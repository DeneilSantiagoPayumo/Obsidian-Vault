```ad-tldr
In this lecture, we will ask how – if at all - can older anthropological debates help us to understand contemporary problems of misinformation/disinformation on the internet? Is ‘misinformation’ in fact a problem for the internet today? What are the political consequences of the ways that digital media operate? And what happens if we decentre the US experience and focus on misinformation in other contexts?

```ad-quote
title: Karl Popper
The 'conspiracy theory of society' is 'the view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or groups who are interested in the occurence of this phenomenon who have planned and conspired to bring it about ... [arising from] the mistaken theory that whatever happens in society - especially war, unemployment, poverty, shortages, which people as a rule dislike - is the result of a direct design by some powerful people.'
```

This is a critic of Marx - ambivalence as to whether a conspiracy theory blends into genuine conflict or not. This definition should not be something that is taken as a gospel truth. Conspiracy theories are not left or right wing.

```ad-quote
title: Fassin, 2021: 130
Anthropologists “do not ask what conspiracy theories are and whether conspiracies can be good or their theories true, or at least it is not their main interrogation or point of departure. They take it for granted that conspiracy theories do exist, and they are less eager to define them than to acknowledge and comprehend them. Besides, they have no interest in ridiculing them, however exotic they may seem with their lizards and aliens; condemning them, however harmful they appear to be in contesting preventive measures or exciting aggressive behaviors; or justifying them, however enlightening they may sometimes seem when they reveal actual plots by political or economic agents. They take them as social facts just as they do with religious beliefs, political ideologies, moral norms, or even scientific paradigms, and some may even be tempted to treat them, in certain cases, as total social facts, like potlatches, cargo cults, chattel slavery, or global warming. The significant point is that they try to distance themselves from the habitual pejorative evaluation of these phenomena.” (Fassin, 2021: 130)
```

We need to think of theories in three ways:
1. Analytical - thinking of myth, belief, ritual, narrative, **structure of feelings**.
2. Decentre the US and Europe. Let's look globally! 
3. What's so special about the internet as a space for conspiracy theories?

## Lecture notes:

## Science, knowledge, critique

Back to Karl Popper! A general notion we'll find in Fassin - when people are spreading conspiracy theories is part of a critique of power and a social critique. As we've said before, it raises the question of where is the line between conspiracy theories and other forms of more academic and legitimated social critique?

Some elements we can think of are quite central: one is the idea that you need to do your own research. It is important to highlight that: conspiracy theories, theories about vaccination, about COVID are not anti-science. They are a kind of science and scientific in respect to claim to back up what you're saying with evidence. 

This kind of hermeneutics of suspicion. A suspicion of power -  "It's not about 'a virus', it's about control."

It's based around suspicion and mistrust - example of South Africa.

```ad-example
title: Fassin
1990s South Africa - denial of HIV and AIDS. As the AIDS epidemic spread, it was viewed as a conspiracy theory to 'rid' the undesirable illnesses of the world.

Thabo Mbeki argued from their perspective, aids was not viral, not caused by HIV but caused by poverty. He was picking up discussions from the US. We need our own studies to suggest if it is viral or not.

This notion that AIDS is a viral illnesse caused by HIV was a means for big pharma to push the medication. We can see that there is elements of truth in here as well as sometime deeply concerning consequences. Large pharma companies were selling anti-viral medicine at great expenses at such a rate that African countries were unable to sell. AIDS is connected to poverty ... however the health minister's suspicion of anti-viral medicine made the pandemic more acute than it actually was.

There came a point where pharma companies then decided to give medicine at an affordable rate, but his suspicion prevented the roll-out. The protest movement that came out **should not** be dismissed. Racial segregation was based on apartheid from this notion of disease. Even in the 1990s, conservative politicians in South Africa had accelerated the AIDS epidemic to attack South Africa (Liberation Movement). 

It's not actually that much of a stretch to pull out a sort of ideas.
```

Other conspiracy theories - suspicion of 'mainstream media', of the state, of corporations. It's also shaped in cultural history, COVID conspiracies, and a question about health treatment broadly, the experience of minority ethnic communities in the UK and people of colour in the US - experiences of being experimented upon. When we have these kind of experiences in one's past, suspicions of one's state or whatnot are not unwarranted.

A number of scholars think that conspiracy theories are about explaining misfortune and explaining communities of practice ([[Lee et al]] on COVID data visualisation that shows this notion of 'doing your own research' on how to present your data that proves the point).

[[Lepselter]] talks about UFO groups in the US as a community of practice, searching about alien abductions, the uncanny.

The kind of community that joins in 4 Chan or Facebook groups are all about the business model of the social media company - it is how they make their money.

Before we come back to that, let's discuss...

## Semiotics and meaning

This is a cool notion - Apophenia. What it is is the tendency to see patterns in random data. We might react with that as a form of illusion or mistake but in reality, a lot of contemporary machine learning is about finding patterns in existing data.

This is something conspiracy theorists do rather well: it is part of this structure of feeling that Susan Lepselter finds of the uncanny - *"Nothing happens by accident - Nothing is as it seems - Everything is connected."*

Finding and seeing patterns - encapsulating the suspicion towards the powers that be, to see behind the mask, and other symbolic narratives and affective elements. She argues that alien abductions in the US take the form of captivity narratives that are well embedded in US history.

We connect narratives of abduction of white women by indigenous people, and there is something similar in the narrative structure between the two sets of people: being abducted, returning to home, tracking other myths like the pioneer myth. It tracks the Cold War story of suspicious, myths and uneasy technology of the Cold War.  A sense of the uncanny, the resonance which themselves are portrayed.

What I want to suggest is that we should think of explanation slightly differently - we're kind of used to explanations as 'unravelling' and showing some truth, some variable that explains what is going on. This kind of disentangling of complexity to explain the unknown, the misfortune. But Lepselter's argument is actually that conspiracy narratives, in part an explanation of misfortune, is about a means of living with complexity, a sense of "this is how I am" in this world and to unravel it in a rational format, but not the standard one I am being told to work with.

Explanations - describing as we live with this complexity, beyond this question of explanation, uncovering an explanation as living with, the point about semiotics should consider the symbolic patterns and tropes of the narrative itself. The use of humour, innuendos, and all these things that create the need to read below the surface that only certain people have access to - to do their own research, to divine what is really going on.

Those kind of things multi-layered kind of meaning allows Trump to say things that are unacceptable in any other kinds of space under irony and humour. Under the discussions of misogyny on the internet is this notion of 'banter', just having a joke. But actually under the sign of irony and joking things happen and it allows fangs and to read in to what some figures say or signify. (15 MINUTE CITYS ... WELCOME TO THE REAL HUNGER GAMES ...) the idea that you should turn into walking distance into the neighbourhood to the idea that the government will control us by stopping from driving.

Is Swift going to endorse Biden to overturn Trump? It sounds dumb, but it's gaining traction! It's a lot more complicated.

## Politics, polarization and hate

There are ideas that get repeated throughout the internet - for example a suspicion of gender ideology. In Brazil, a gender ideology and homophobia became a big part of Bolsonaro's success.

Memes about gender ideology have repeated from Brazil to even Spain. They're concerned about different elements of society, gender ideology - this [a picture of a meme of a teacher filling children with gender ideology] is about teachers, sex education in school, ideas about what is going on in school.

These images are very critical. Bolsonaro's campaign fostered humour, love, hate that fed into contemporary political polarization. She analyses the political campaign through [[Victor Turner]] 's stages of ritual and maps them to social media campaign. ([[Cesarino]])

1. Markers of social structure are suspended
2. Communitas is formed - togetherness and opposition (schismogenesis - Bateson)
3. The culture core is addressed
4. Mimesis and anti-structural inversions are performed
5. Subjects become influential.

Social media and anonymity of social media is a means of which social markers are restricted. The lecturer thinks its an interesting theory but doesn't fully agree. But, we should think of what it says to me (is she talking about the first bullet point).

Communitas, an differentiated community, this way that people are brought together through togetherness. In Bolsonaro's case, the football strip. Differentiated from these teachers that aim to indoctrinate these children and bringing these anthropological context from [[Bateson]], setting yourself in opposition to another group.

The culture core is addressed: for Turner, symbols address cultural fundamentals, Bolsonaro campaigns.

Mimesis (repetition) and anti-structural inversions are performed, when normal hierarchies are subverted symbolically. Kings serve commoners. With Bolsonaro and Trump you've got a taboo of a figure of ridicule is going to the highest office that is a form of symbolic inversion. 

Subjects becoming influential - community is formed anew. People are through the ritual come to submit through the community, the moment between two states of social structure where things change when they come back. In Brazil, [[Cesarino]] calls this liminal period of 2016 with the impeachment, with a moment of liminality and uncertainty that Bolsonaro took advantage of. I am connected to people in a special way.

## The internet itself - how does this spread?

Emotional contagion ([[Hayden]]):
1. Fear, suggestion
2. Symbolic mechanism (mimesis)
3. Building of community and communitas
4. The business model - and technological affordances.

Algorithmic processes - it's easy to go down a route into a bubble, down a rabbit-hole where you get presented with more and more extreme material. That's partly because extreme material provokes clicks. We know that. People are horrified by people and look into it, so the algorithim takes it again.

We have a mix of anonymity. "My cousin sent me this audio, is it true ... I know a friend of mine who was sceptical of COVID vaccinations ... Their older son and father was so sceptical ... She had gone into thinking about these theories like "The Great Reset" - she's not a weirdo, she's a good friend! It has the effect of worrying people."

## Summary:

Merely revealing the truth and the fact to combat it just becomes another theory - saying that a theory is good because it has peer-reviewed journals and such is just not going to cut it anymore. It is full of symbolic communication, and effect - structures of feeling that are context specific.

Diagnostic of power. Also important is that they reveal something crucial about how we communicate, believe and feel - and how we do that collectively. That's why figuring out an anthropological perspective brings up slightly different and interesting stuff.
