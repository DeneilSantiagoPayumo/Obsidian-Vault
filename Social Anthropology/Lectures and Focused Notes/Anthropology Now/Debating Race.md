## Part I. Critiquing Race and Evolutionism

a. Key Concepts
i. Evolutionism – explains social difference temporally via progression
toward ‘civilization’
ii. Diffusionism – rebuttal to evolutionism, posits that same degree of
cultural elaboration can occur in different contexts, cultural elements can
be borrowed or diffused
iii. Historical particularism – cultural differences do not track a linear
progression from ‘savagery’ to ‘civilization’ but are an outgrowth of
specific historical circumstances
iv. Cultural relativism – cultural differences intelligible in context, judgments
of sophistication and value contingent on circumstance

b. W. E. B. Du Bois and Franz Boas
i. Both critics of evolutionism, racism, Nazism, and eugenics
ii. Contributed to unsettling the idea of scientific racial typologies, but they
did so using different methods

c. W. E. B. Du Bois
i. Advocated for the importance of ethnographic research
ii. Race and racism are social facts
iii. Disputed scientific approaches to race

d. Franz Boas
i. Also critiqued notion of scientifically verifiable racial types, but did this
using anthropometric tools
ii. Largescale anthropometric studies proving that
1. anthropometric characteristics were heavily environmentally
dependent, so that factors like diet could influence measurable
physical traits in a single lifetime
2. even taking these anthropometric data into consideration, there is
more variation within supposed racial types than between them
iii. à the scientific conceit of racial typologies is factually incorrect

## II. Part II. Revisiting Race and The New Genetics: Social Constructivism, Critical Race Theory, and the Case of the US vs Brazil

a. Key Concepts
i. Social constructivism – categories don’t exist as a precondition of social
life but become convincing as a result of beliefs, practices and
institutions; in many ways an extension of earlier theories of historical
particularism, cultural relativism
ii. Critical race theory – emerged principally amongst legal scholars,
advocated studying race in terms of structural, political, and legal
inequalities, rather than in terms of individual prejudices
iii. The new genetics – a body of advances in genetic testing that made rapid
and largescale data-gathering possible; coincided with increased public
interest in genetic information and commercially available genetic testing

b. Unfinished Business from Du Bois’ and Boas’ scholarship on race…
i. Had Boas’ use of scientific tools lent credence to the scientific study of
race?
ii. Did Boas and W. E. B. Du Bois occasionally use scientific concepts of
race in their writings? If so, what did they mean by them? Have we
overlooked nuances in and differences between both authors’ work?
iii. What was the relationship between W. E. B. Du Bois and Boas? Has the
discipline overlooked the central contributions of Du Bois?

c. Du Bois – race used in different ways in his scholarship, but most often as a
social idea of use in building his vindicationist argument

d. Boas – ambiguities in his use of the term as well, but ultimately never entirely
detached himself from the scientific approach to race (even where he and his
students’ worked to disprove it and critique its use as a basis for racial prejudice)

e. Visweswaran 1998
i. Ultimately Boas’ approach to studying race, while it was often applied to
what were thought of as anti-racist projects, had downstream effects
ii. The result: ‘…in accepting the distinction between race and race
prejudice, anthropologists have failed to recognize that the significance
they attach to the apparently biological character of race is itself cultural
or ideological in nature (Harding 1993). Today, the fact that race is
socially and historically constituted seems almost too common-sensical to
note’ (ibid., 74)
iii. à The solution is to fully treat race as socially constructed, which allows
us to examine which biological or natural attributes are linked to it and
with what effects

f. Wade 1993: the US vs Brazil
i. Which biological attributes treated as relevant to race is ‘historically
situated’ and therefore must be studied as a social phenomenon (23)
ii. Consider the following
1. US
a. One-drop rule and historical preoccupation with blood
purity as a direct consequence of slavery and Jim Crow
b. à a race concept that depends on ‘ancestry’ and ‘descent’
(genetic substance, blood, etc.), strong social distinction
between black and white
c. Appearance still matters, but as an index of ancestry
2. Brazil
a. More value attached to mestizo in context of colonization
b. à a race concept that depends on perceptions of physical
appearance less directly linked to ancestry and an
understanding of racial differences existing on a more
fluid spectrum
c. race and racism are not lesser issues as a result, but race is
naturalised differently than in the US
iii. à looking at which ‘natural’ or ‘biological’ attributes are treated as relevant
to race matters for understanding race and racism in different contexts

III. Summary
a. Social constructivism is not a realist proposition about the world, it is an analytic
tool – it does not argue that race and racism aren’t ‘real’ as social phenomena, and
it doesn’t deny the fact of genetic and physical differences, but it does allow us to
examine how certain ‘biological’ attributes are enlisted in making certain ‘social’
concepts of race convincing

b. More generally, as an analytic move, it allows us to examine how a given category
(race, gender, sex, etc.) that is treated as natural is the result of (not a precondition
of) social beliefs, practices, and institutions

c. This has been a powerful tool when thinking about race, as it has allowed us to
challenge bodies of scientific research that have presented biological data in
support of racialised conclusions as a-social and beyond question

d. Instead, anthropologists have examined all the ways in which biological or natural
attributes have been enlisted to make different concepts of race convincing in
different points in history, and the role scientific research has played in this

e. Understanding this is important for coming to grips with how race and racism
work in different context
