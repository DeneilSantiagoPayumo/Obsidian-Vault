## Lecture notes:

## Human Nature

[[Thomas Hobbes]]' (1588-1679) claimed that humans are naturally prone to conflict
Parallel traditions of thought suggest an idealised understanding of human nature
Anthropology has used comparative field research to consider if war is 'human nature.'

In the 1960 -70 s, the anthropology of Hunter Gatherers interrogated 'the state of nature'.

[[Napoleon Chagnon]] 's research among the Yanomano said that war is natural and inevitable. Ethnology has deconstructed the idea of universal tendencies towards either war or peace.

## Everyday Life

Giorgio Agamben's (1942-) 'Bare Life' and the 'State of Exception' are influential ideas in studies

Irene Calls (2017) describes the rupture of everyday life in the Palestinian West Bank.

Social Anthropology has widely considered human resilience in the face of brutality.

[[Hayder Al-Mohammed]] (2015) questions the idea that war erodes social life. In Basra, city life continues to function through everyday ethics of care and social responsibility

In contexts of insecurity, the value of social bonds may be emphasised.

## Collective Memory

Societies 'remember' war through collective memory
Paul Connerton (1989) claimed that 'mnemonic devices' of collective memory are public, explicit and non-textual.
Not all cultures place an emphasis on explicit memorialisation of suffering.

Romany Gypsies are a diverse community that share a history of persecution.
[[Michael Stewart]] (2004) asks why Hungarian Roma do not memorialise the Holocaust.
For Gypsies, daily life itself is the mnemonic for the Holocaust.

1. Ethnography questions the idea that war is human nature
2. Despite experiences of rupture, anthropologists have highlighted the resilience of everyday life in wartime
3. Collective memories of conflict are often important to how communities imagine themselves
