## Lecture notes:

## Egalitarianism

Conservative models that formed the early basis of this thinking suggest the idea that human beings, due to the interest of themselves, their narrow views, their families, egalitarian contradicts the human tendency of hierarchy and self-interest.

The natural space for human beings is equality, where they emerge in stresses of market systems. More left-wing views.

However, a great appeal to egalitarian is not restricted to the economy at all - but gender and race as well. Those are dominant trends that shape political lens. The concepts of gender equality first became a feature of popular and political point in the late 18th century - this was a complex development.

Wollstonecraft's vision was one where distinction between classes were unproblematic. In this vision, class divisions were beneficial. A vision of gender equality was integral to ideas of women's suffrage and it still somewhat underpins second wave feminism in the mid to late 20th century. Feminist anthropology makes important contributions, giving comparative research to hierarchical gender relations. From the 1980s onwards, we moved to gay liberation, trans right and more.

The way it does so - unpacking normative ideas about what a man or woman should be. Principles of racial egalitarianism also feature in world's religion, however the politics of racial equality became public debate in the late 18th century.

Racial equality became significant to abolitionism and then anti-colonial struggles. As ethnographers began to interrogate the colonial research and things, as people began to do fieldwork in places of complex internal racial hierarchies, there became a tendency towards racial centralisation (in the sense of a higher study and attention paid to it).

Social Anthropology has produced a large body of comparative research. [[Sahlins]] claimed that nomadic Hunter Gatherer societies were egalitarianism. He was trying to prove [[Karl Marx]] 's view was correct: that Capitalist structures distort natural egalitarianism.

They avoid surplus, accumulative wealth and as a result people are equal.

However, 'egalitarian' societies have been found to have inequalities of gender and age. There are plenty of societies where the dominant value is egalitarianism. Cultures that practice strong sanctions between people.

Even in societies that are sensibly egalitarian, it transpires that adult men are more powerful than most women and children. To try and think this through, we can consider how hierarchy functions in traditionally small societies - look at the Columbian anthropologist (who teaches in this department) that discusses the rise of inequality in Amazonian society.

## Ideas of Inequality

They are collective groups with shared socio-economic experiences and interests. Classes define themselves by different classes and different degrees of power and wealth. One's class society determines one's life positions, chances of realising your ambition and more. The nature of a class system is self-reproducing through generations.

Marxism suggests inequality... You already know this!

Economic structure are too materialistic - [[Pierre Bourdieu]] discusses this in depth. He discussed economic, social and cultural capital. But you already know this! A person can experience class and reality differently by learning different things and making social connections.

```ad-example
title: 1999: the professor gives an example
The lecturer was interviewed for an undergraduate interview at Cambridge. When he arrived, he went to 'the college'. He assumed that the other applicants knew each other as all these young men and women were chatting to each other about their lives, their schools. Those people needed very little to preface their introductions: they didn't need to explain themselves. 2015, back in Cambridge, older and bolder. This time, he was back for an academic conference.

The presenters present their research and everyone discusses them. If you're lucky, someone says something constructive and helpful. If you're unlucky, you get destroyed. He was asked to be the discusser of this.

The organisers of King's college promised food, accomodation, ride and more. He was given an entire suite of rooms located in this elite building that very few people go in, and the porter who showed him to the door said that no one has been here. You could never buy yourself in this suite: you must be invited. Only the right type of person must be invited.

What happened between 1999 and 2015? It was not an acquiring of means of production, but an acquisition of social and cultural capital based on social relations from attending university, publishing books, meeting people and knowing them.

Social sciences have struggled to account for structural inequalities in a flexible manner.

[[Max Weber]] - notions of 'life chances'
[[Crenshaw]]'s - notions of 'intersectionality'

## Is there more inequality than there used to be?

Many global societies legislate against discrimination. Bourdieu and Crenshaw would argue that inequality is not just the things we have, but how society perceives you. On the surface, it looks like people have improved - the world's societies have made advances.

Many parts of the world have made efforts to reduce systemic inequalities. But that varies considerably in respect to gender and sexuality. Also, it is self evident that there is an uncertain relationship between banning discrimination and reducing its importance.

For example, MeToo, BLM suggests that the world has a long way to go about addressing abuses of power. Some ethnic groups, youths are likely to spend higher rates in prison, less likely to finish education - doesn't go on a simple global distinction, there are systematically ethnic groups in the nation states who are struggling.

There remains a system inequality despite these death pains. Race still matters to that experience, likewise with gender and income gaps between men and women have narrowed in most places. Gaps in some form still persist. 

*The Great British Class Survey* - class inequalities are increasing in wealthy nations. [[Mike Savage]] conducted a survey of social class ever attempted in the U.K. It had 161,000 respondents. The chief findings of the surveys go like this - the UK at this term upper classes had all three forms of economic, social and cultural capital. Those classes enjoy more social connections, consume cultural products deemed as valuable, enjoy large houses, and are more likely to be recipients of elite universities.

They tend more strongly now to socialise one another, to live in the same neighbourhood, enjoy the same leisure activities and have the same aesthetic tastes. For the past 25 years, we have seen a marked increase in class inequalities in the UK.

In the 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals programme claimed to have halved world poverty. This program has an ambitious goal in eradicating poverty by 2030.

However, we must be sceptical. In the 2017 book in this reading list: [[Jason Hickel]] argues that the development industry masks systemic global inequalities. His argument goes like this: people mistakenly believe that poverty is natural, due to environmental pressures and otherwise. It must be said, the development of poverty or professionals, haven't pulled that stupid move for many years. The argument is that poverty and inequality is how we structure our economic systems - to achieve sorts of labour production. It is impossible to increase standards of living in rich countries without disenfranchising places where the world's goods are not being developed.

International development is markedly ineffective at reducing inequality. Inequality has in face increased. Since 1960, the income gap between the global north and the global south has tripled and is still growing right now. A millennium goal programme keeps changing its own targets. The original programme was developed in 1996 and the aim was to reduce the absolute number of people living in poverty. 

The UN is claiming to have halved world poverty ... but in reality that claim is basically unreliable, the statistic is driven from way before, and the world is more unequal.

## Questions I had:

## Summary:

Some societies are more unequal than others. Egalitarianism is a social principle, not an objective condition. In the smallest, nomadic populations that have egalitarian values, they still have inequalities of age and gender.

For that reason, egalitarianism's best approach is a social value as opposed to an absolute tradition that societies can fulfil in its entirety.

Second, general trend and theories of inequality has been towards ideas progressively textualized and subtle through time.

We move from one thing to ideas that consider multiple forms of identity and power and how they relate to one another. We can see a shift between one form to another. 

On balance, levels of social inequality are increasing. The gap between the richest and the poorest is increasing at an overwhelming rate in the space of a single generation.
