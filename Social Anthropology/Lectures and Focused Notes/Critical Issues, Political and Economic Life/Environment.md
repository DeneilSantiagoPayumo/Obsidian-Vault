## Human Ecology

This refers to the interactions between people and their environment. We can term this using the term, Human Ecology. This initially described how societies engage with space, water, and sanitation. Farming,  mining and more. For most of the time, ecological conditions determined human social organisation. Secondly, the environment is understood differently by different cultures.

As social anthropology has developed in the early 20th century, people considered how ecology gives rise to radically different social organisations. It did so by studying societies whose ecological conditions were fundamentally different from the conditions that most researchers lived.

Consider this fact: the social science were developed by cultures that relied on settled agriculture for thousands of years. Places lived in one year, stored surpluses of food.  Settled, large-scale societies that could develop urban sensors, trades. From an archaeology perspective, anthropologists encountered very different kinds of societies. Societies whose structures had a completely different human ecology.

Since the early 20th century, anthropologists have been interested in how different societies understand the environment - how this reflects the value system of different societies.

A brief example: for example, it turns out that if you look at things closely, there are more examples that view the outside world as a hostile wilderness, and other sorts of societies that see the natural world as a source of abundance. A political moment - policies to tackle climate change experience differently depending on values summarised.

[[Roy Rappaport]] discussed ritual and ecology in Maring societies, Papua New Guinea.

This is an area where social anthropology anticipated that trend by many days. 

Human society, he argued, should be understood as ecosystems. Such a society, there is an ecological problem with Maring communities. They require a lot of human labour to take care of. Pigs are seen as good symbols of status. Pigs, if not taken care of, will destroy the environment.

Therefore, you must balance a ratio of pigs to humans. The problem is how to exploit nature without harming it, without harming oneself. The Maring created rituals that balanced the slaughter of pigs with the deaths of human beings. Deaths that occur in the context of warfare. At the time Rappaport was writing, warfare was very common in Marine societies. During festivals and funerals, one needs to take offering to spirits.

The net result is that the eco-system is balanced once again. They do so without access to specialised scientific attention to the environment.

## Anthopocene

Anthropology is increasingly interested in the interaction between humans and non-humans. Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch, characterized by major human impact on the world. Driven by massive human population growth and resource extraction.

The Anthropocene challenges distinctions between nature and culture. Human is animals, culture is understood as a series of things devoid from nature. Nature exists 'out there' and exists on its terms. Anthropologists have challenged that distinction between nature and culture. 

[[Sherry B. Ortner]] - women are subordinated to men ideologically supported that women are supported with natural bodies, menstruation, childbirth whereas men are empowered through economy, ritual. Patriarchy makes no sense without an understanding of how people think  about the nature/culture distinction.

Society, environment, years to come. However, as much as the Anthropocene concept describes something of severe importance, the way the concept is being used assumes things have just been woken up. When we judge on a global scale, there are long standing grass roots, environment movements that predate the current movement. The Anthropocene debate sudden awareness of environmental change and singular human responsibility.

Their efforts are criticised. The Anthropocene believes that these movements are new: (they believe) things don't come into being until scientists and such argue for it. Assumes that the society is responsible as a whole for their ecological impacts.

[[Nayanika Mathur]] considers the politics of environmentalism. They simultaneously believe that there is a government conspiracy that uses conservation as a scam to seize their land and control their lives.

What anthropology contributes to an understanding of this: rigorous, long-term studies and human engagement with the environment. We have bodies of research in parts of the world impacted strongly in times of rising pollution, sea-levels, patterns.

Social and cultural dimensions of this scale. We can anticipate it.
