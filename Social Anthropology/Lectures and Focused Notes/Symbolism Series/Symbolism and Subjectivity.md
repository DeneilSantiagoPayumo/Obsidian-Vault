## Topic one

Korowai lived in this outer periphery of global market connections and make their livelihood from the rainforest, in the 1990s they were met by tourists. They have been visited by 10,000 tourists and 50 TV shows: these tourists come from all over the world.

Tourists believe that the Korowai embody the past: they live in nature, not are degraded by money and they are specifically fascinated by the idea that some Korowai have never seen white people before.

There is a connection here: Korowai symbolise the bad things of a tourists life.

In Korowai thinking (the focus of this lecture), to get at what tourist signifies we will start from the main word:

```ad-seealso
title: Linguistic Symbolism: two words for tourists
*Tulis* - borrowed from the Indonesian word **turis in the late 1990s**
*laleo* - literally 'zombies', applied to radical strangers since the early 1980s.
```

When Korowai borrow the former word into their landscape, they imbued a different meaning: an ethnic proper name. Tourists are tourists when they came on their trip and know each other in their homeplace. Tourists like government officials, traders, church workers and Korowai take the name 'tourist' as the main prototype of people coming in. 'Tourist' includes Asian and they are generically talked about. Tourists can mean 'city person' or 'foreigner' or 'white person': an ethnic category.

The term 'Tulis' (tourist) signifies an ethnic group. Something we can call symbolism and symbolic order has a logic of its own.

The shock of tourists and what they were like characterizes them like non-human people: *laleo* was the first word used. We can think of Hollywood zombie as they are similar: people and monsters that we all become when we die. Korowai are petrified of them. These zombies want to be reunited with their living relatives, wanting love but meeting them will cause the Korowai to die. Relatives are supposed to support each other, and want to give a food gift but you can never reciprocate their affections.

People use symbols to characterize their daily lives. They had the category of zombies and used it. Korowai refer to themselves as human, and characterize zombies as the opposite of that. It was pretty apocalyptic. This is a pretty big version of xenophobia and ethno-centrism.

A broader issue about symbolism that ties into the idea that symbolic order exists. It is the relationship between symbolism and subjectivity - consciousness, mental and emotional lives. What we think.

### "Ideology interpellates individuals as subjects." - Althusser

[[Althusser]] comes from a Marxist background. He believes society is this giant system of inequality and wants to consider how these systems reproduce itself over time.

He looks at ideology and views it as more important that coercion: and so this sentence summarises his idea on how ideology is effective. Subject in the sentence means conscious person. Notice the interesting spelling of 'interpellates' - rather, what this word means is 'to call out to' with addressed person recognising themselves in the call. It's like you're walking down the street and the policeman calls 'Hey you!'

Another anthropologist: the emphasis placed on mothers to dedicate themselves to bento preparation interpellates women into extreme commitments to carry their men. Also, it interpellates men into relying on these women. Finally, it interpellates the children into accepting the authority.

Something noteworthy: the appreciation of these interpellations.

Althusser argues that our thoughts and feelings matter to how society works, made in the image of the symbolic order or system. It gives an account of how good symbolism feels.

Symbolic order sets the terms of what people think and feel. Explaining subjectivity is difficult: if those tools can be linked up to explain why people have the consciousness they do, it is a really big deal.

For the last step today, we will recognise as this as really wrong and seriously partial and incomplete. A counter-pattern (from everyday activities) is that people are reflexive on using symbols. Think about this broadly: the metaphor of a 'window', if symbolism is a window, experiencing a window we don't see the window but what is outside it.

The point of the focus is the meanings that it makes present, what we can access through the symbolic process. In a lot of symbolic processes we are aware of the processes mediating the meanings that we're accessing through.

An example: a study by [[Ilana Gershon]] to see how uni students in the US thought about the intersection between romantic relationships and technological media. She wanted to consider the different means of breakup - privately, over text and more. And so across that range of possibility, the information that the students communicated symbolically was the same. I break up with you. It is the same thing. We're not a couple anymore.

People have strong reflexive ideas on what is appropriate and what to use one form or media over another. Another vein of symbolic media is from the reading list: [[You Can't Talk behind the Holy Spirit's Back]] and his ideas around spoken language. What people do reflexivity is what they undergo and pick apart on what different symbolic media in their lives and do: it is not a one way relationship where we are completely shaped by the social order, we consider, we understand, we dissect together symbolic media.

What we think of as art are places where language speakers reflexively focus on the shape of communication and media. And painting is about a sensory expression of media: let us see 'looking' as a process in of itself. Playing with and looking for alternative meanings of symbolic order, of what people are living through.

Some Korowai take money from tourists, gaining activities. Perhaps we can see tourists as gaining changes and new institutions and consumer culture. They are a concrete form we are encountering. They find painful of how much material prosperity exists in other people's lives that they have very little access to.

They are a symbol of global geopolitical inequality: basically, for the last meeting at 2017, the Korowai were asked to narrate about the history of tourism and how Korowai tourists cooperated with each other. They wanted the professor to help fix this situation of inequality and ask the government for good exchange relations and good balance of material conditions and financial aid.

Looking back to Althusser: people don't recognise themselves fully in the categories of symbolic order. With their relations to this form of category of human that was called 'zombie', all these Korowai people went from fearing them to admiring and desiring them. They see their own past life and current life as being not automatically good - in a troubled relation to their own symbolic order.

Their symbolic order is inconsistent and says multiple things at once. There is a mix of being consciously reflexive, having critical distance from it, semi-conscious and unconscious taking for granted behaviours. These varied patterns of relations to symbolic order is central to an anthropological study.

There is something that the Korowai is taking for granted is the grand concept of inequality: of course, that is what people are concerned about. The tourists come the U.S to help our  inequality. In this regard, this symbolic order is taken for granted.
