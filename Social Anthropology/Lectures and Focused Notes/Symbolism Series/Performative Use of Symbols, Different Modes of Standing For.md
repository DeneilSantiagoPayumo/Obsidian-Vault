Third lecture:

To cover the end of the previous lecture, what wild boars signify among Kiwai:
1. Humans
2. Masculine ferocity
3. Difference of men and women
4. Complicated relation of similarity and antipathy between men-associated killings and women-associated reproduction

This is a sort of Structuralist analysis. Would the Kiwai themselves had said this about the symbolic meaning of pings (pig = moguru ritual = men's house = masculine killings).

Since the 1970s, most anthropologists have rejected Structuralism as a framework because of the assumptions linked in there: the idea that symbolic order is unconscious, and that structuralism holds that if you can sift through loads of data and patterns, you can identify the symbolic order regardless if the people living in those symbolic order are cognizant of the order.

Other assumptions (such as [[Claude Levi-Strauss]]):
- **Symbolic order is mainly unconscious** (what this lecture covers)
- People live in one bounded symbolic coherent order
- Symbolic order is outside of time and history
- **Symbolic order is separate from use, action or practice** (What this lecture is covering)
- Symbolic order is separate from the material world
- Symbolic order is separate from power, evaluation or desire

What is symbolic order is particular to someone's particular interests? What if structural order exists out of that?

Today, we will look at linguistic anthropology which has a lot in common with structuralism in the sense that it focuses on signification and meaning as things having lots of meanings. more-so than they're made of. They see activity being at the heart of the social order.

We will study two examples.

## English speakers using 'fake Spanish expressions' in their English conversations

A style of English.
[[Jane Hill]] calls it 'mock Spanish': common in the US, the most famous example used in the movie Terminator Two. The boy teaches the terminator to be more cool, telling them bits of Spanish: the terminator uses mock Spanish ("Hasta la Vista, baby.").

What Hill shows is that there are three layers of meanings in a mock Spanish utterance. She uses a tough jargon versus denotational (dictionary) meanings versus connotations.

When people say something in mock Spanish such as "I'll do it manana", they're using the denotation: I'll do it later.

There's a second order direct indexicality that the **speaker is easygoing and jocular**.

Then, there's a third meaning of indirect indexicality: the stereotype that **Spanish speakers are lazy, procrastinators, temporally unreliable.**

Other mock Spanish uses imply in the background imply Spanish speakers as sexually loose, insincere, vulgarity and more. It's hard to identify layer two and nearly impossible to identify layer three. Layer two speakers may be aware of the connotation but don't understand the pejorative meaning.

One pattern of this is to use words that aren't inherently funny in Spanish and imbue it meaning to English. For instance, Spanish people say "Adios" which doesn't mean much except goodbye. English speakers use "Adios" to argue in, good riddance, goodbye in a negative way. Here, beneath that second level of the speaker's jocular persona, there is an indirect stereotype of an ethnic type of Spanish speakers being stereotyped, treacherous.  

The boy Connor says "Adios" when tossing the arm of the terminator into molten steel liquid to destroy it. But the terminator says 'goodbye' when moving himself into the molten steel, sacrificing himself. In other words, treacherous goodbyes mean 'adios' and heartfelt goodbyes simply are 'goodbyes.'

Perhaps this suggests that Hill is onto something, as Spanish speakers being insincere or treacherous. This stereotype is not denoted by the speaker, but denoted by the white person's use of mixing.

For someone to be racist, people believe that their racism has to be intentional and if someone doesn't self-consciously mean to be racist then they are not. However, the racism can be semi-conscious *and* collective. People take the cultural structures in place without really meaning it, only arguing for intentional racism.

## Joking patterns among a patch of people in Arizona, United States in the 1970s

This is similar but in a different political economy to the mock Spanish.

At that time, Apache adults spoke with awareness of the broader understanding of the environment around them. An anthropology left something for an Apache woman. By accident, the recorder was on.

Bahr found that these Apache people imitated a white person:
The situation follows - these is this Apache guy L knocking on the door of a husband and wife. The husband starts yammering at the guy in English - "Hello my friend! Sure, it's my Indian friend, L. Pretty good alright!"

Everyone was pretty humoured and everyone cracks up. The wife, at the end of the joke, claims that 'white men are stupid!'.

So, we can apply this to mock Spanish: there are multiple layers of representation are going on in this joke.

There's 5 levels of signifiers:
The signifier: "Hello, my friend!"

Signified 1: dictionary meanings of his words

Signified 2: white guy greeting guest, being hospitable

Signified 3: the husband is putting on an act, the joking routine is drawing attention to itself as a special interaction. The joker is two people at once. He is an actual Apache guy *and* a stereotypic white guy he is pretending to be.

Signified 4: white people are immoral, joker affirms Apache values: the joker uses this act in more specific things that signify that the contrast between white people and Apache, signifying with a moral feeling that white characteristics are bad. The humour works as a caricature, coming from Apache cultural sensitivity.

Recall the fact that they opened up with "Hello, my friend!" as though they're mocking the white people for considering people as friends without meaning it. Then they address the subjective state: "How you doing? How you feeling? You feeling good?" For them, this is a violation of privacy. Then, the Apache people like to go and not draw attention, contrasting this: "Look who just came in. Sure, it's my Indian friend!" Then, he addresses their name: "How you feeling L ... You sure looking good to me, L." It seems strange to them. Also, the Apache people touch the guest: on their shoulder, looking them in the eye. This is seen as animal-like. Also, the Apache orders the guest, "Come in my friend!" which is seen as a violation of autonomy. He asks a ton of questions which violates a lot of Apache norms: "You hungry? You want some beer?" Also, the Apache person asks, "Maybe you get sick" - they believe that talking about sickness produces as such. ^e26af7

This short and quick interaction are a whole lot of interactions of Apache norms. These criticisms affirm sign's use. "White men are stupid!" There is a reinforcement between how to make a meaning: the pantomime way of enacting that meaning. The humour comes from the pantomime performance than saying it directly.

Signified 5: buckskin between jokers.

The fourth level was about relations between white people in general. But this layer of meaning is going on and being created among the Apache that are present: one broad meaning the joking makes present is a feeling of humour. All of these first four layers interact with each other to create a feeling of levity and transgressive-ness. What's here on the slide at layer 5 is a further more specific effect that jokes have among levity and humour. The humour of close friends symbolises that this is a special social relation where we violate rules of connection that cannot be violated with general category of people - you wouldn't joke that way! So this part of the meaning of joking claims to be in this relation.

This breaks the rule of equality - don't act better than other people. The transgression of these rules break only those that you're in a deeper relation with. 

*Another example of someone pretending to be a GP bandaging another hand. They make presumptions about people, about taking influence and bandaging others. The "white man" is acting uncivilized.* 

The person addressed by the joker is made uncomfortable by this interaction and so that person being joked at says "enough" as something is becoming uncomfortable. The Apache take the joker as taking a claim of superiority. Why? We can affirm these values of how monstrously impolite it would be to do this. In the relation between these two specific people. The joker is affirming the friendship and flexibility of this relationship, doing something really rude to demonstrate how good of a relationship they have.

# To wrap up:

People *do things* with symbols in action, creating new realities. They make realities in action. They joke and affirm societal values.

Symbolic order can be about the situation of use: again with the mock Spanish joke, people are drawing attention to themselves as an artful speaker: they are using this language artfully.

Symbolic order is order *about* symbol use, about the doing of symbolism. Signifiers 'make present' signified in different ways.

Indexicality is a specific way signifiers make present signified. Just translate it to connotation. It is a tool of talking about the larger problem.

A lot of this is adapted from [[C.S. Peirce]]:
- Iconicity - a relation of likeness between signifier and signified
- Indexicality - there is a relation of proximity or continuity between signifier and signified
- Convention - the signifier and signified are connected by an arbitrary rule.

One example, "um" - it does not denote anything with the dictionary definition. Instead, 'um' characterises the person saying it to the situation of speech, saying something of 'hold the channel clear, bear with me, I'm nervous, whatever, I'm wanting to attend these.' It indexically holds to these meanings rather than having to say it all out.

It matters a lot of how people experience the force of relations and examples. Given how people say adios or manana.
