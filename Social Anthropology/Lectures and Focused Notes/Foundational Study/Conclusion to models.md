How Anthropologists think – conclusions

Simple models and complex reality

- Cowan 1990 on Functionalism – “the concept of culture retains traces of its functionalist origins. It continues to be understood as the articulation of moral consensus and of shared symbols, beliefs, values, ideas.”

- Malinowski 1922 – simplifying a more complex reality

The history of theory is always selective (sometimes unintentionally) in order to illustrate a theoretical point, in order to push forward one’s own views – “I have included political economy and structural Marxism within this period because both schools continue to share a set of assumptions distinct from what I wish to emphasise for the anthropology of the eighties” (Ortner)

“The surface resolutions of social science articulate with an extraordinary constancy in basic concerns” (Abbott)

- Change vs stability
- Individual vs system
- Description vs interpretation
- Objectivity vs reflectivity

How does writing anthropology reinforce power relations?

Heuristics – tools for thinking
Evolution/development
Function – are there mechanisms making this situation persist?
Structuralism – is there some implicit logic to these cultural patterns?
Interpretivism – how do these people make sense of their world?
Writing culture – who wrote this? Where were they coming from?
Practice theory – what are people actions doing in the system?

The time of the gypsies
- “this is a study of how some of the most marginal and exploited people that exist can imagine themselves to be princes of the world” – functionalism
- “Stewart’s achievement is to make us see the gypsies from their point of view, or rather from the many points of view they employ to cope with their situation” – interpretivism
- “My own attitude, it seems to me now, reflected the concerns of the Rom. The world that obsessed me and captivated my attention was that which the Rom wanted to show me: the world of horses and their owners” – writing culture

What makes anthropological theory anthropological?

- History of the field
- Ethnography
- Comparison 
- ‘seeing twice’
