Kinship is a philosophy itself, held by many cultures "about what completes a person socially, psycholigcally, and morally, and how that completeness comes about through  a responsible sense of attachment and obligation to others"


```

Kinship caters to our needs, creating the bonds that allow us to care. We tend here to think about care as what we do to others, but McKinney here imbues a notion that being responsible, being caring, being obliged, being caring for others is fundamentally what completes us. It is a mechanism to which that completeness comes about through a responsible sense of attachment and obligation to others.

Kinship of course is a primary domain of care for many societies, but anthropologists want to draw attention to the ways in which feeding, caring and loving change from place to place. 
## What is care?

It is a relational practice. Arthur [[Keinman]] (2014) argue that care for the elderly and the ill are a moral practice that defines us, makes us more human.

Caring completes us as human beings. The rising interest in care is only partly related to economic concerns over the care crisis. Over 10 years there was a moral panic in euro-American and western world over these projections over how many people were living longer lives and how many people were in need of care but there was very little provisions over care.

There has been a growth in middle class women in the north and the consequent deficit of people to care for the young, the old - ... 72% of all American women worked.

For Anthropologists, care and the care industry conjoined the economic with kinship intimacies and the affective and political domains in striking the really helpful analytic for understanding new ways of belonging and analytic.

"Medicine has relatively little to do with caregiving. Nurses, social workers, occupational and physical therapists and family members are the artisans of are giving."

In many parts of the world, care is done by migrants and done by global domestic miggrants.

[[Parrenas]] 2003 argues that:
 A growing crisis of care troubles the world's most developed nations. Even as demand for care has increased, its supply has dwindled. The result is a care deficit, to which women from the Philippines have responded in force.

[[Borneman]] (2001:37) argues that "They were asserting an elementary principle of human affiliation: the need to be cared for, and the need to care."

*Unfortunately I was not paying attention to this anthropologist. If you want the gist, it is apparently a story of two homosexual men who ... escaped tax systems by pretending to be in heterosexual relationships?*

There have been many striking examples onto what is going on in the ground, about homosexual relations - take a look at the mummy baby diagram.

Let's take a look at the Burden Sisters. This is the case of two unmarried sisters, Joyce and Sybil. They lived in the homes. They took care of their parents and then when they passed they took care of each other. They realised that if any one of them died, they had to pay the 40% inheritance act, forcing the surviving sister to sell the house. They took this case to court and lost the case. The attempt was to give inheritance to someone to escape tax liability.

They went to the European Court of Human Rights was lost. A right to a legally inherited right of care lost the attempt to escape the tax burden. Even though same sex marriage was already gone, they could not benefit from the protection of marriage.

A quote: "We are struggling to understand why two single sisters in their old age, whose only crime was to choose tot say single and look after their parents and aunts, should find themselves in such  an position in the UK in the 21st century."

Borneman wants to "seek alternative for conceptualizing human affiliation". He argues that "Anthropology's quest for a regulation ideal for humanity has involved the repression of care and the privileging of form of communal reproduction; anthropology should instead privilege in analysis caring and being are for as processes of non-coercive, voluntary affiliation."

## BODIES

"The enlightenment tradition celebrated the mind and its alleged rationality, not the body and its pains and pleasures." - Mol, Moser and Pois

There was no need to study care, no way of getting it in the public setting. "Someone or other just needed to get on with it."

Bodies in their fragility matter as much as mind. Labour that goes to tending to these bodies deserves serious academic consideration.

The ideas about women and mothering began to reach Feminist anthropologists recasting the care of bodies as not just the matter and care of women at home, but the use of the term of domestic labour - to add value to it, to see women's contribution to it as visible and equate public labour to it. Such debate continues to be important not least because domestic labour continues to be shared rather unequally between homes and outsourced to poorer regions in the world.

Mol, Moser and Pols also discuss care recipients being treated as passive: this alleged passivity is tellingly condensed in the term we use 'patients', someone who is able to accept delays, problems and suffering without becoming annoyed and anxious. in order to address.

Annemarie Mol (2008) discusses how "beautifully mobilising the logic of choice can lead to poor care. It can shift the weight of everything that goes wrong onto the shoulders of the patient-chooser."

Good care is about adjusting, tinkering - "The logic of care starts out from the fleshiness and fragility of life." We must address diseased bodies.

*Missed a bit of this. Blame Rafa.*

Studying this phenomenon anthropologists see how the care industry shifts into motherhood.

"A global heart transplant" - we must give our love to the care. In the absence of my children, children in the Philippines grow up longing for emotional intimacy in the Philippines. The care attributed to them seemed to be longed for something else. Because of their mothers migration, they had never experienced poverty like their mother's generations had.

The thing that really struck her was the continuous WIFI, open screen, talking to each others kids, talking to relationships with each other's children, an open skype call from the minute they came home - even skype calls doing homework with the kids. Care at a distance can become one.

[[Neely Myers]] 2015 talks about recovery edge - an ethnography of mental health care and moral agency.

[[Lisa Stevenson]] discusses life besides itself - northern most territory in Canada where Stevenson finds a suicide epidemic in Inuit youth. They reflect on why there was such an epidemic of suicide. In order to understand the present suicide epidemic, you had to go to the past and understand the Canadian's response to an earlier epidemic. The response to that threat was couched in humanitarian terms.

"Such indifference is sometimes perceived as Inuit as uncaring, even at times murderous, though it is always couched by the state in terms of benevolence and concerns." Their entire history was history of trauma from the state. They tracked the family history and found this decimation of Inuit culture and identity.

Adams, Carol. J defines caregiving as "attention that is helpful to another because of the other's physical, mental or emotional needs." She becomes forced to care.  What is striking about this article (towards a philosophy of care through caregiving) is the lack of choice towards getting the care giving choice, falling to the person living near, without a career, to an unmarried child. It was care of conscription.

[[Rupert Stasch]] and his work on caregiving - between caring for and caring about the Korowai. No time so we'll end on [[Felicity Aulino]] (2016) - the question what is care. The article looks like care in Thailand, and it is a phenomenological account of the daily care routine. It is about Aom and Ying, the eldest daughters of 83 year old Tatsanii who has been in a coma for over two years The two sisters gear themselves up for their mothers. They want a basic routine of care. It takes the two sisters together 3 hours for a whole cycle. They need to do this 4 different times a day. When she first comes home, changing, bathing, cleaning, massaging, feeding, routine took the sisters a full 3 hours so they can't complete one cycle to another. Aulino draws our attention to these physical procedures and argues we need to understand them in terms of not just the moral content but in terms of ritual. Repetitive rituals and practices achieve effects through performance. It is rituals of care. We challenge the common presumptions of care giving of the time that we saw in Carol Adams or Kleinsman about care as intensively moral humanizing activities. Ritual allows people a way of acting "as if" the world were a certain way even when faced with uncertainty or contradictory evidence. The actions themselves, rather than internal cognitive orientation, are of utmost importance."

It gives us better attention to the frustration and mental processes of care giving about those who have bad thoughts about care. They are aware it is not perfect.
