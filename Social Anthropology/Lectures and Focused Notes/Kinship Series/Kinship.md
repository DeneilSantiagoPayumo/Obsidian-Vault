# Lecture notes: Kinship

Kinship is to anthropology what logic is to philosophy - it is the basic discipline 
of the subject.

Families should not be weighted with geological defined relationships - there are many different ways families characterize and address kinship: one ground rule of anthropology is that we don't consider geological relations as the only way of making relations.

## Weston

Americans "tend to imagine kinship as a discrete and private domain, [but] many ostensibly non-familial arenas are infused with heterosexist presumptions and regulated by kinship" (1991: 6)

The cultural framework that comes to configure kinship serves as a template in which people interpret the world around them. The monkey cage draws attention (see later) show how kinship ideology is absolutely naturalised. In the US, the nuclear family is a privileged construct - people tend to imagine kinship as a discrete and private domain even if these are filled with kinship assumptions. No matter how kin connections can be imagined, they hold an important place in anthropological theory.

```ad-todo
title: Kinship exercise:
How do you define kinship?
How do you sketch it out?
Do you depict it graphically or material objects?

Begin reflecting on what you think for yourself count as kinship or your kinship relations.
```

Is it a family of choice? Birth? Blood? This should remind you the ways that kinship as a concept ranges into relations of humans and non-human. Material and immaterial words capture the core of our being.

Kinship is an amorphous polythetic concept.
There is no singular definition of kinship of any group of anthropologists

Three approaches:
1. A system of categories and classifications
2. A legal means to designate rights and responsibilities
3. A practice of collective or individual behaviour

## The Marriage Law

The Delhi court coerced women into getting married. The law under which the civil court worked was the 1870s law of the Special Marriage Act of 1782. This law qualified that people could marriage across caste and religious boundaries. If a young person wanted to get married to someone their families didn't approve it, the state could witness their union.

In practice, this didn't work - the puzzle (of the lecturer's fieldwork) found that nobody really used this marriage law.

Henry Sumner Maine argues that the basis of the basis of the family in Rome were artificial, not based on blood - men held dominance over the family. There were people who were incorporated into the matriarchal household through adoption, misplaced foreigners and more. They regarded this unit as being held over by the power of the patriarchal figure.

He saw parallels between in the India of his time (1860s) and ancient Rome where this type of family still existed in India. The complex societies he argued, such as 1970s Britain, people weren't constrained by the patriarch and could exercise agency and freedom. This was his key contribution

Societies were moving from 'simple' to 'complex' family forms and that in turns mapped onto a shift from relationships based on 'status' to those based on 'contract'.

Young people were trying to find new ways of expressing their religious identities that didn't fit into different categories. He saw this as a breaking away of tradition - a show of new traditional belief. Maine was undoubtedly evolutionist but looked for relationships defined by free will to contracts. 

```ad-quote
title: Maine about evolution:
"THe movement of the progressive societies has been uniform in one respect. Through all its course, it has been distinguished by the gradual dissolution of family dependency and the growth of individual obligations in its place. The individual is steadily substituted for the Family, as the unit of which civil laws take account."

```

Thus, Maine popularised the notion that the so-called 'primitive societies' were organised on the basis of kinship whereas 'modern' ones were based on 'contract.'

## Susie McKinnon

"modern" society has happened through the enduring trope of **"the subordination and transcendence of kinship"** - has produced models of modern politics and economics that render invisible the meanings, functions and structural force of kinship in these processes. Kinship is made to de-encompass politics and economics.

## [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]

Classificatory versus descriptive kinship systems.

He argues that simple societies progressed through a series of stages from primitive promiscuity where anyone could be your father to a system based on monogamy wherein biological paternity could be certain.

Collating these terms for kinship antiquity, some societies had ways of classifying kin that had remarkable similarities.

[[Karl Marx]] read this book and annotated Morgan's book extensively. Engels even used this in his own work. Morgan has received disproportionate prominence in the world because 'that stuff went on.'

He found that the Iroquois distributed among the clans father and child so that they regarded each other as brothers - memberships of the clans was described as "having one blood" and the clan remembers to marry outside of the clan, with specific ones.

Morgan argued that the Iroquois confederacy organized all into one political family - they recognised the senator of the wolf tribe as their brother.

This introduced to anthropology an uncomfortable dialect about primitive versus modern society. Alongside these development comes Darwin's *The Origin of the Species*. 

### David Schneider:

He argued that American kinship was based on the idea of the order of nature (by blood or biology) and the order of law (by marriage or social norms).

### Kate Weston

She argues that in any relational definition, the juxtaposition of the two terms gives meanings to both - gay or chosen families cannot be understood aside form the families that gay and lesbians call biological blood or straight. She uses kinship as the principle means as of how gays in San Francisco area give meanings - non-appropriated sexual identities and non-appropriated sexual relations can claim family ties. Gay families are not a variation of American kinship, but seeks to undermine it.
