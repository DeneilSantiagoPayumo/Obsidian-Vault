# Lecture notes: Love

*The lecturer forgets to put on the slide.*

Our individual theory of emotions were thought to be locked to the mind of the individual, and therefore inaccessible to anthropologists. Thus, for a long time, anthropologists were unable to study love.

"They consider love to be an epiphenomenon of anthropological research ... in other words the problem with love comes to be ideological in that it was circumscribed as an emotion and therefore unimportant to anthropologist ... it was frequently disparaged by local informants, for instance the idea that marriage was arranged by families ... this served as a basis to relegate it to the margins of anthropological inquiry."

Along this concept, the myth of romantic love as the exclusive basis of marriage for Euro Americans was accompanied by a failure to mention that arranged marriage were commonplace in 19th century England. We have this sort of skewing effect of what non-western marriage kinship is about. For example, cousin marriage was common in 19th century England, not something exotic people did. Yet, we have this polarization of narrative as euro Americans were known to have love and this effect.

Even Darwin sought to get his ally, an MP, Charles Nuvok (Nuvock) to introduce a question about close-cousin marriage in the English census in the 1870s. He believed that close cousin marriage was responsible for defects and deformities and illnesses amongst children born of offspring out of cross-cousin marriages. Yet... Darwin married his cousin. Weird.

The tendency to make marriage arrangements gifts of dowry or bride-well were reinforced by historians and anthropologists. Fischer and (Anyak?) argued that the anthropological study of romantic love due to the assumption that romantic love is only common to Western states, elites who had the time to cultivate an appreciation for subjective experiences. This is something that they believe needs to be cultivated. Underlying these views is the assumption that this is directly linked to romantic notions of love.

A scathing critique that romantic love is central to European is wrong: such exclusive (autoship) by the West appropriates love in the 70s and 60s. Phillip Aries made the notion of childhood being developed historically, and argues that the West had defined the notion of romantic love.

This leads to the thesis that love is closely associated with modernization.

This played no mean part in the characterization of non-western cultures as easily ignored or dispatched actions of western or urban elites who were so exceptional they were best ignored. Leaving aside the extraordinary implications of love songs that exist in so many cultures.

*The lecturer turns around and realises that she hasn't put on the slide.*

We've got Punjabi novels about star crossed lovers - the sort made by Waris Shah (1776) about Heer, a person belonging to a high caste and Ranja being a Jat and playing a flute. He is employed by her father to tend his buffalo and she falls in love with him.

These stories exist everywhere. In all these tales you've got sights that are venerated.

It is striking then that anthropologists make the argument that the lack of love in non-western cultures fed into racist discourse about other cultures. Hell, even the US author the declaration of Thomas Jefferson (2002 [1785]) argues "Love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation ... in general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection."

As Cole and Thomas puts it (200(9):
 "By depicting lust as omnipresent and love as absent in Africa, thereby situating blacks as morally and spiritually inadequate, these European perspectives established a set of racialised polemics that would inform subsequent discussions and representations of black intimacy."

Love is "naturalised" and is "made to appear natural, essential and immutable through its representation and reproduction in cultural systems of meaning." (Padilla et al 2007: ix).

Judith Gay (1986) published her research on "Mummies and Babies" and Friends and Lovers in Lesotho (Le-sutu).

She argued that institutionalised friendship called "mummy-baby" relationships between young girls in modern schools provided social and emotional support during adolescence.

They existed alongside heterosexual relationships.

It drew attention to the "ethnocentric polarization between homosexual and heterosexual relations" that defined western societies.

This study would provide a fresh look at affective relations among members of the same sex.

This place is land-locked and Lesotho is an independent kingdom ruled by a king. It is a poorer country than South Africa so there is a massive outflow (when the mines open) that goes to the mines from Lesotho. This outflow of main labour and poverty lead to real conditions of instability in marriages and households. Women are left with large numbers of children and women have to find their on way into the workforce, moving from rural homesteads to homes in Lesotho.

Missionary activity is happening in Lesotho that was highly disrupted.

The anthropologist notices that these initiation ceremonies for girls haven't happened for a good few decades in the area she was working: they are seen as backwards. One of the effects of those practices was to create a collective cohort of young women who would produce relationships for the rest of their life. The lack thereof means they lack a support network.

These women who were mothers would be encouraged to work and their daughters would be struggling. The solution comes be to send these kids away to boarding schools, helping those kids get taught. Here, these relationships really flourish. These 'mummy-baby relationships' come out of care, of mothering and being mothered and without the risk of childbirth and child care since pregnancies are frequent among teenage girls.

Girls describe these friendships has 'ho ratana'  (to like or love one another), lecahko (to visit), sethaka (a relationship between age mates, referred to girls who have been initiated together) and mechaufa (to fall in love or to flatter).

The accepted norms of these unions was that only one baby could have mummies although mummies can have multiple babies. These relationships were conducted through love letters that were sent and spread back and forth. It was also through sweet giving.

As one informants explain, friends may visit, love each other and give gifts: "But between mummies and babies it is like an affair, a romance, and being alone together to hug and kiss each other is always a part of it."

Mummy-baby kinship diagram: the mummy plays a protective role with their babies. These help them navigate their bonds and metrosexual (heterosexual?) relationships.

These systems challenge the polarization of homosexuality and heterosexuality, but also demonstrate how girls loved each other that was separate from relations with their boyfriends.

Let's explain love.

Love as a fulcrum in which the personal and political meet, navigating political systems. It allows us "a glimpse into the complex interconnections between cultural, economic, interpersonal and emotional realms of experience." (Padilla et al., 2007). The political economy of male migrant work in Africa causes instability in home giving us a knowledge of female intimacy that gives us an understanding of female love.

We see personhood, identity, meaning making. From gender and sexuality, communities and political entities such as nation-states.

Let's consider some theoretical ideas about love:

### Andrew Gell "On Love" (2011 [1996])

"Love is the ultimate indiscretion."

Love and knowledge for Gell are intimately connected with every society working as an "informational universe".

The forms that love takes in a given society are based on the forms of "social knowledge" in that society.

Marriages of cross-cousin are arranged when girls are very little. Romantic love doesn't happen through marriage. She argues that men are "waiting for the girls to grow up". Umeda in Sepik, New Guinea: romantic love takes the form of adultery. Affairs generated "lethal knowledge" - the disclosure of which invariably led to allegations of sorcery, leading to death.

In Modern love, modern couples need to create a narrative that transforms the arbitrariness of two people picking each other to the exclusion of so many others, these created courtship histories that serve to embed that relationship within their social world.

He speaks of the "reciprocal exchange of an escalating series of indiscretions through which the courting couple gradually create a lovers pact, not to each on each other, sexually or verbally."

The exchange of information by the couple forms the very basis of the relationship. A person chooses another because of the knowledge they have that all other potential partners were unsuitable - information is controlled and transacted so people could create their romantic selves. This information was exchanged between two persons.

It explains maiden love and love in second life, the virtual world of another anthropologist.

People choose and marriage those who are quite like themselves despite how they choose to define that. They choose to define themselves as "we were so like each other and that is why we fell in love."

In way of contrast... let's look at:

Some Muslim man who had his Hindu wife taken away from him by her family. He climbed a signal tower in protest. The lecturer wrote a book on this.

This is a powerful demonstration of love, interestingly that the law in practice was circumvented (aspects of the law that prevented bigamous marriages were used to stop love marriages). They had to publish the bans and as fast as bans were informed, they would go to their families and talk about this.

Skipping a few slides into intimacy and the economy: so what love means, how it is performed...

Padilla et Al argues that sex is prevalent outside of marriage and money more important within it than the ideology of relationships would have us think. The myth that is about commodification - that myth suggests that true relationships cannot be commodified and intimacy and commodification needs to be kept entirely separate.
