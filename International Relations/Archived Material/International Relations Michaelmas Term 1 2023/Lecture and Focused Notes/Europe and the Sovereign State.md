Lecture 2 - Europe and the Sovereign State

- Lecture 1: we started with relations rather than states  
- Europeans as maritime supplicants were forced to play by local rules in the East; in the Americas, they were ambiguous overlords
- Biases of place, time and name: inter-national relations or inter-state relations??
- International relations as a field as it is, not IR as we would like it to be
- Presentism - focus on the now
- Ambiguity of terminology; observer bias; 

  

Difference between a nation and a state? Terms overlap somewhat
Nations tend to regard language, culture and identity
States tend to concern the formal legality of diplomatic recognition, defined borders and centralised administration.
Conceivably, we can have nations without that of a state: e.g. Palestine, Kurdistan

  

Tilly - State making as organised crime

- State making akin to your average mafia
- ‘Relatively centralised, differentiated organisation the officials of which more or less successfully claim control over the chief concentrated means of violence within a population inhabiting a large, contiguous territory’
- States make war and war makes states
- Focus on violence
- Not at all focused on the social contract; more of a pessimistic interpretation of the state
- Sceptical of the idea of the state working in the best interests of its citizens
- Nobody designed the state to look like it does; people were backed into it by accident through cumulative improvisations, in response to the rapid technological and military threats in the early modern period. 
- Darwinian international military competition and learned emulation led to the convergence on the state
- Very literally the survival of the fittest
- Leaders reached down into society to extract resources necessary to sustain and equip armies
- In order to figure out what to seize and conquer, rulers wanted greater understanding of other societies
- Haphazardly began to create a bureaucracy in order to provide taxation
- No taxation without representation? If only!!
- Compromises could be struck between rulers and certain influential subsets of citizens
- Those directly wielding military force are joined in the ruling elite by those who can provide financial support e.g. bankers
- Vicious cycle: more territory = more resources and so on and so forth. However, the vice versa can also occur; mortal danger of statecraft
- State violence for profit: protection costs and tributes
- Provided a preview for global post-colonial state-making
- Large number of small states becomes a relatively small number of large states
- States also become more similar; dysfunctional institutions lead to battles being lost, which precipitates a negative cycle of decline

- Olson - Stationary and roving bandits; you can’t take everything all at once as this leads to starvation and weakness. Long termism necessitates a decision as to how many resources to extract at any one given time

- Violence is primary; economics is secondary
- Violence can be an economic force within itself; states can seize money in the form of ‘tributes’
- Violence can be used to improve commercial fortunes by demolishing competitors
  

Bad habit of international relations: once we have Europe figured out, we have the entire world figured out
Tilley: post-colonial states look fundamentally different
- In some sense, the newer states haven’t undergone the same toughening up process (international Darwinian competition) which is why we see so many fragile and failed states outside of Europe

Almost sentimentalism?? Warns against deviating from statecraft as an organised crime

  

Spruyt

- Economics is the primary driver
- Strange same-ness of contemporary states, from macro to micro
- Variety of pre-modern political forms; mediaeval messiness, Pope and the Emperor
- Very noticeable how similar most states are; 40 states that consist of populations of under 1 million.
- Nauru; very noticeably similar to the UK when it comes to institutions, despite only having a population of 9,000 people
- This was never always the case; we used to have empires coexisting with institutions such as the Papacy, not to mention feudalism
- We need an explanation for why state models converged over one similar model
- Who’s the boss? Hard to answer in the Holy Roman Empire for example - was it the emperor or the Pope?
- Supreme side of authority was up for debate (one of the causes of the 30 years war)

  

Is there a fundamental distinction between international and domestic politics?
Domestic politics = order; international = anarchy
This was not the case in the Mediaeval period as borders were so unclear; the lines were blurred

  

Today, there is a distinction between the property of the state and private property. This was not the case in the Mediaeval era

Distinction between ‘King of France’ and ‘King of the French’ - is there authority over a defined territory or just a ‘people’?


Merchants began to find this very inconvenient for trade; at this stage, three times of institutions arose to try and do a better job:

1. Leagues
    
2. City-states
    
3. The sovereign state (epitomised by France)
    

  

- They all did a better job than feudal equivalents but they did not do an equally better job; sovereign states were far more efficient 
- War is secondary (according to Spruyt); economics is primary
- Why do states have success in war? Success in warfare is derivative from success within the economy
- Warfare is an indicator of a functioning, thriving economy, as they are able to successfully provision their militaries
- People observe these indicators because monarchs not only want to survive, they want to become rich.
- There is thus a desire for self-improvement, which leads to mimicry
- Less survival of the fittest; more survival of the most economically efficient

Sovereignty as a state is essentially the membership of a club; you must be recognised, and thus interact, with others
State is a solution to messiness because it provides easy-to-define borders
For other people to know what country you’re in turns out to be very useful
Clear boundaries allow for greater economic efficiency

  

What do we mean by efficiency? Spruyt argues it relates to successful trade and exchange. 
Economic progress occurs when we are able to specialise (division of labour), and we then trade for whatever else we need


Ideas of mutual empowerment is that institutions simply prefer to deal with their own kind
Why the Hansa was not fully involved in 17th century peace treaties

  

State leaders assumed to be relatively rational; they look at well-functioning foreign examples and attempt to mimic them
For Tilley, war creates states. For Spruyt, states evolved gradually through enlightenment and resultant mimicry
Spruyt’s analogy is based around states and firms; international politics and markets - a popular concept by IR theorists

Both states and firms try to maximise (e.g. profits, power etc)

- States operate in anarchy; firms operate in a market
- States are in competition under anarchy, as our first within the market
- States (or firms) that do badly gradually decline and may die

  

Emphasis on transaction costs; if we try to trade, there are two problems:

1. Before, must figure out the value of exchanging (analogy of clothes shopping online; offering free returns). In state terms, even measurements were not standardised; even money isn’t reliable because coinage was not standardised
2. Afterwards, we must govern the contract we have made. One of the handy things about the state is the fact that they reduce after-the-fact transaction costs. People can exchange with confidence, which accelerates the division of labour
  

Conclusions:

- Sovereignty and anarchy are two sides of the same coin; every monarch is supreme within their domain but other than that they are limited. Rulers interact formally from a position of equality
    
- Relationship between states is anarchical because there is no higher power (e.g. world governance)
    
- External pressures lead to internal consequences for state-making
