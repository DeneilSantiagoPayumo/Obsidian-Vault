## The concept of 'global governance'

"Global governance" refers to the management of global affairs beyond the sovereign territorial state. It is the exercise of government-like functions in political spaces without centralized authority.

Multilateralism refers tot he cooperation among three or more parties on the basis of 'generalized principles of conduct' ([[Ruggie]])

Modern multilateralism privileges sovereign states, developed towards increasing institutionalisation (rules, practices, and bureaucracies) and inclusiveness (universal participation).

Global governance diffuses this establishes pattern: more actors, different forms of cooperation, variable participation.

Imagine 3 axis that multilateralism has developed.
The first (X) is institutionalisation - rules, procedures and bureaucracies (international law and international organisations), where rules and bindings are more explicit and binding.
The second (Y) is membership - once we move from exclusively same-place forms of organisation, we can look at organisations that are based on state membership - NGOs.
The third (Z) is state-centrism - membership that is centred around the sovereign state.

For now, this is abstract. Look at the United Nations created after WW2. It is state centric, has universal membership and high levels of institutionalization (an inter-governmental organization).

Let's look at G20. It is very state centric, only some members. It's institutionalization is low as it has no secretariats, no basing. It is just a summit. Membership too is very low.

Let's look at G20 - a global campaigning. It forms part of global governance. It is not state centric. Membership is low - it is not global. It has mild institutionalisation.

## The development of modern multilateralism

The Westphalian Peace is often credited with establishing modern multilateralism. However, the peace of Westphalia was not a multilateral conference in the modern sense and the treaties of Munster and Osnabruck were not multilateral agreements.

If you read the treaty of Westphalia, you might have questions like: who binds whom, what individual binds what individuals? If you look at who's doing the contracting, you realize that "peace between his imperial majesty" and "the house of Austria" and more: just individuals between their majesties.


When did modern multilateralism take its modern form?
Well, we can look at "The Congress of Vienna (1814-15)".

Great powers met with everyone and organized the political order of Europe to protect the rights of dynasty and prevent future war and revolution. They recognised Europe's political order.

The victors of the Napoleonic Wars and France determined the post-war settlement. Large territorial states benefited; other entities were delegitimised. It standardized how diplomatic relations should be carried out.

The Congress of Vienna recognised the special privileges of great powers, clarified diplomatic procedure and created the first international organisation - the central commission for the navigation of the Rhine.

In 1815 once Napoleon was defeated, there was a concern that a return of borders (by European powers) will destroy trade. The Rhine position was an attempt to coordinate trade, an area where polities can trade freely.


International trade grew exponentially between the 1820s and the outbreak of WW1. The Industrial Revolution, the steamship, and the telegraph created a globally connected world (and a great divide between Western societies and others). 

The increase in trade and mobility created externalities and the need for cooperation - as a result, governance initiatives proliferated conferences, agreements and organisations.

In 1865, 20 European states created the International Telegraph Union (ITU). So called public international organisations were the predecessors of today's inter-governmental organisations (IGOs).

The outbreak of WW1 created momentum for discussion of a 'world organisation' - Britain and the US led the establishment of the **League of Nations**. The League Covenant created an umbrella organisation that brought issue-specific international public unions under a single roof, later developing the blueprint for the **United Nations**.


Is this expansion or stagnation?
The cumulative number of formal IGOs since 1815 has increased since 1850s. Let's look at what happened over the past two decades: there has not been a moment since the congress of Vienna of stagnation that was prolonged as what we're experiencing right now. States no longer create formal inter-governmental organisations at the same rate as what they have done in the past.

What's going on then? Our crises - like climate change, migration and more - are the context of these issues.  This rather is a transformation of IGOs, as we have moved to creating a number of informal governmental organisations.

## Conclusions

The rise of modern multilateralism was instrumental in consolidating the sovereign state's privileged place in global affairs.

Multilateralism developed in a path-dependent way in response to major power interests and functional needs stemming form growing interdependencies (the Industrial Revolution, then globalisation).

Global governance is not limited to interstate cooperation, it involves different actors at different levels using different forms of cooperation (multi-level governance, summits, regulatory networks, public-private governance initiatives and so on).
