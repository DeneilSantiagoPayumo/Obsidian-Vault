The principles for today: the nation-state principle, the emergence of sovereign, territorial nation states in the Americas and war and state-making.

30/10/23

Sovereign is an organized political community that is a recognised as an authority beyond its borders.

Then we have the other component - state capacity. We might recall Max Weber's theory that a state is a force that has a monopoly on the force of legitimate violence. The bureaucratic apparatus is the administration of the prince's property - expanded both horizontally, becoming greater and bigger and vertically, increasingly powerful and intrusive in society. A state that can extract resources from society and exchange protection.

Then, we have nationhood - we have the state should be congruent with its political community, identifying with a particular group.

Problem is that most states in the national system don't conform with this model - modern states identify with these states and cover that political community but they have the capacity to protect them.

Some people have countries with bureaucracy and independence not recognized nationally - think of Taiwan, Palestine. What about single nationhood with the United Kingdom? If we listen to the US political discourse politicians will talk about the nation meaning the state, talking about nation-state when they mean the nation and so on.

Two parts: first - state formation in the Americas

## State formation in the Americas

Varying patterns of colonialisation: different time periods and labour/land regimes means institutional variation.

Establish political regimes that allow them to extract labour from these population (Spanish) whereas the English were particularly settled. Settling in the new world and connecting with social and political conditions as well as gender relations.

Different colonial institutions:
- Enlightenment reforms - increasing revenues and centralised control, strengthening imperial defence in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War. For example, stamp act - settlers paid for the defence of the colonies by taxing important documents.
- For British colonies: "no taxation without representation" - checks on territorial expansion
- For Latin America: Bourbon reforms, exclusion of creoles from higher offices, expulsion of the Jesuit intelligentsia who were part of the educated class and weren't fully loyal to the crown. By the late 18th century...

The French revolution influenced the Haitian revolution informs a discourse finding several ways of European attempts to establish control over the island. The French revolution obviously led to the Napoleonic wars.
The Atlantic Revolutions aimed to overthrow the ancient regime in Europe and the Americas, replacing dynasticism with nationalism as the basis for political legitimacy.

## Grievances of the Americans

"We hold these truths to be self evident that **all men are created equal** ... with certain **unalienable rights**..."

"That to secure these rights, Governments ... [derive] their just powers from the **consent of the governed.**"

"That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these end, **it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government.**"

Similar grievances, varying paths to statehood: elite pacts (US and Brazil), social revolutions (Haiti, initially Mexico) and de facto civil wars (Spanish America).

The path to sovereign statehood condition later state building (slavery, inter and intra-state conflict, public debt, etc.)

## State building in the Americas

Spanish American countries determined their territorial limits based on the principle of uti possidetis (as you possess).

The US expanded under the doctrine of Manifest Destiny. It benefitted from the international context (Napoleonic wars) and weak neighbours (Mexico).

Political ideas and loyalties were local - citizens would identify citizenship quite easily. These countries determine that the easiest way to grow forward, in absence of any other rules - they didn't have the same approach of slow growth of vertical growth, instead they were born as nation-states where states grow at the present in the periphery: this determines the political conflict between the countries.

Borders weren't set in stone so disputes over boundaries didn't largely exist. The problem was that for the boundaries that were, Spain didn't clarify *where* these boundaries are. Eventually, they claimed citizenship with the nation - largely in the basis of territory.

So, this was far ahead from the United States - the largely local political elites (members of a political colony) and the original 13 colonies of the United States allowed the United State to expand territorially by Louisiana and France

### War-making and the rise of the "Yankee Leviathan" ([[Richard Bensel]])

Let's consider [[Charles Tilly]] that argued the state was built in a cycle of protection and creation, creating a bureaucracy that can extract resources efficiently that determines the power of the state. How did the US become so powerful? Well, they focused on creating revenue through customs (tax on import and export of good) - a person sitting on the phone talking about goods coming in and out. It is unlikely that people of the country will demand representation on this, whereas they might for diect taxation.

This pattern varies heavily during war - peak in revenue and the expansion of state capacity increased during war: shifts power from local to national. For the civil war, the federal government has an army, a bureaucracy, to protect us from the inside and outside and extract resources and thus state capacity increases. We have another one of these spikes after WW1 and (to a lesser extent) WW2.

### Limited states make limited wars, limited wars make limited states (Centeno)

United Kingdom and France at the bottom - we see that the importance of customs declined in the 19th century.

Countries like these are heavily reliant on the import of resources, there was a type of pressure for accountability for pressure - the commodities the price of these fluctuated quite heavily and we'd have a lot more crisis. What will we do when commodity price fluctuates? We consider the role of national debt. We finance war through debts and customs. In a response to Tilly's argument in state making, these states were able to finance themselves through debt. States created through limited war and limited resources pushes American countries to a different trajectory. It looks similar to countries in colonial societies.

## To conclude:

The emergence of sovereign nation states responded to similar dynamics (in America) but state formation and state building followed different paths.

The nation-state principle emerged in Europe but it was in the Americas where it provided the foundation for asserting sovereignty and statehood - it became the norm of self-determination.
Not all states are de facto nation-states (states do not equal nations do not equal nation-states).

This concept becomes universalized in the concept of independence.
