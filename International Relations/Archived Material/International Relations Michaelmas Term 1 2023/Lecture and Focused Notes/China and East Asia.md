## Lecture notes:

Here's a question! Is international religion and politics the same across the world? 

There are a many of key events: for example, a failure to establish global European-wide authority. You get a sense that there's an important principle of sovereignty, that these monarchs have supreme authority, and none therein above them.

Sovereignty and anarchy is two sides of the same coin.

At most simple, the balance of power is this: when one state in Europe is becoming too big, that it threatened the existence of independent states, smaller states will clump together to become a big state to stop that state from overtaking Europe.

Early modern European state of international relations: successive attempts to build a Europe-wide empire were defeated by coalition and alliances of states. Napoleon, Hitler and so on had a go. There's this rough equilibrium of 5-6 great powers, and this balance of power between this great powers.

Developments in technology can be attributed to competition between European states. It is easy to tell of Europe as a failed of imperial states. There's an Eurocentric presumption as what counts as success, failure, what is normal and deviant.
## Topic one: Historical China: Empire or International System?

Over the last 2000 years, China has spent about 60 percent of the time being an empire, 40 percent of the time as multiple great states and powers. For maybe 11 or 12 centuries out of 20, China has one big place - contradicting these ideas of the balance of power.

China is a tricky word: we look at the people's republic of China.
China is an empire, getting to that way the same way empires are built.

It's important to dispel the myth that we had a single, unchanging China for 5000 years. That's a lie propagated by the Chinese government. Not only has China been a system of competing states for a vast vast time. China historically has been wealthy and populace and even in its half-size incarnation, China was as populous as Western Europe put together. It was technologically more advanced, China was militarily more powerful than Europe and Europeans.

China had paper, paper money, professional salaried armies, all these sort of things that European states, at the time, did not have.

There are two conflicting views: the idea and extent to which international politics work different. Sovereign equality and anarchy or Sino-centric hierarchy.

China had these big expeditions - going to India, middle east and even Africa. They had these huge expeditions. China was not interested in colonizing these lands or across the cities .. so why? China, after 1343, lost interest in maritime expansion

## Topic two: International Politics as Hierarchy (Kang)

He is a critic of the Eurocentrism of the field - we have mistakenly universalised Europe when China has a different international system.

Forget everything you know about Europe. Kang has a very strong cultural explanation of Politics - an idea of hierarchy. The main difference in that international politics in Europe took place with anarchy and violence whereas China had a more peaceful and organized in hierarchical lines: China was explicitly superior to subordinate countries (Vietnam, Korea, Japan). He says that the superiority of China and subordination of these countries is not a reflection of material power.

China is bigger, has more power, has a bigger army, so on and so forth. Rather, this superiority and subordination is a cultural one: based on legitimacy, a relationship that superior and subordinates believed was proper - anchored in Confucian philosophy of how the family, the state, international politics should be organized. This downgraded the philosophy of violence, emphasized the value of harmony, a philosophy of hierarchy. Parents were above children, rulers were above the ruled.

What we have here is completely different from the sovereign equality of Europe. Kang argues that this system worked really well as there was very few wars in East Asia. It was very rare that Japan and Korea and Vietnam fought each other - aside from a few exceptions. Because of these shared values, state building operated in a vastly different way. Where Tilly emphasizes violence in the Sovereign state, Kang argues that China is the epitome of government and civilization, with Japan or otherwise deliberately organised as copies of China. Bureaucrats were there instead of nobles, examined on Confucianism.

Rather than the king being de-valued, to be regarded as legitimate you must acquire the vestiture of the Chinese emperor - similar to how, we needed the UN to recognize a state, here the superior must recognize the state.

Kang refers to the tributary system: a cross between a trade mission and travelling embassy. The deal was the tributary, a combination of government officials, nations or whatnot, they'd come to Beijing and engage in rituals acknowledging the superiority of the Chinese emperor.

Kang says this is primarily cultural, primarily symbolic, primarily a system for reproducing these systems of European domination: small peaceful nature, and we never saw Japan or whatnot as trying to square up against China. Japan had what China want: acknowledgement of its superiority, that was reproduced to these trips.

There were no wars of religion in East Asia. Kang gives a flattering image of East Asian politics: not everything worked perfectly, for example Chinese relations with Central Asia where it did expansion in 1700s, and there was not this shared Confucian values. Where there was not this shared understanding and shared idea of doing things, there was war and violence.

## A Different Take on China: Power Politics and War, Then and Now

Kang says there is a use-by date where it got smashed up by the European imperialism. The Chinese government really likes Kang's theory and unlike Kang, the Chinese government argues that this is a moral of how East Asian politics *should* work in the future.

The Chinese government will say: this is a great system, a great time, all that we need to do is to accept China's authority. Kang only argues that this is historical interest, but the Chinese government wants to spread this.

But... Taiwanese scholar Wang says that this is wrong the whole way through. Just like war is the most important thing in Europe, war was the most important thing in medieval and early modern East China. China is no different from European great powers historically or current.

Wang says that China is powerful and aggressive - when it is weak it is defensive like any great power throughout time. Culture, he argues, does not add up that much and East Asian politics were on the basis on anarchy, not hierarchy, on the same level as Europe.

Anarchy leads to insecurity, and is a universal constant of international politics.

He has a theory that war makes states in Asia like Europe - for example, Tilly's [[Charles Tilly]]

Wang concentrates on the wars that China fought in - to a certain extent, we've got a selection bias in that China had relations to the East, and relations in the North. The relations to the rest of North were very violent, and relations to the East were very much peaceful.

A different conclusion: a peaceful kind of relation whereas Kang looks at the much more violent ones. He likes to point about those times China was not a big unified empire.

Wang says that Kang is cheating in the way that China is peaceful, as Kang argues that civil wars are not real wars and therefore do not count. Civil wars were massive, violent and bloodier than the 30 years war in Europe. It is misleading to say that civil war does not count.

Additionally, we have to look at the ways people write history: in Europe, people in charge of fighting wrote the history whereas in China scholar bureaucrats wrote the history, writing about themselves ... and mentioned the general from time to time but mostly wrote them out of history.

Wang failed to account for this historical bias and the way that China got built is just the same of the European empires. Wang's Taiwanese origins are apparent as what he says is contrary to the Chinese government. You've got a myth of the peaceful rise of China.
## Conclusion

In looking at current politics, China is harping on about its 'century of humiliation' from the 18th to 19th century, domination by the West.

To an extent a principle of Chinese policy is to restore China to its natural position. A system that Kang describes. If you look arguments at Tibets, Taiwans, Uighurs, a lot of these debates on what to do differs on what we look at historically.

Lastly, to an extent we find these differences: Kang and Wang looked at the same history and found two different conclusions, the answer that they are operating from different theoretical structures, (constructivist versus realist)
