[[Constructivist Theory]]

Social theories which seek to explain interests and identities do exist. Constructivism concerns itself around identity and interest formation.

This theory that international institutions can transform state identities and interests involve a 'sociological social psychological' form of systemic theory in which identities and interests are the dependent variable.

This article will argue against the claim that self-help is given by anarchic structure exogenously to process. Self-help and power politics do not follow logically from anarchy and if we find ourselves in a self-help world, this is due to process. There is no logic of anarchy.

## Anarchy and Power Politics

[[Kenneth Waltz]] argues that "wars occur because there is nothing to prevent them."

Wendt will:
- Disentangle the concepts of self-help and anarchy by showing that self-interested conceptions of security are not a property of anarchy
- Show how self-help and competitive power politics may be produced causally by processes of interaction between states in which anarchy plays only a permissive role
- Reintroduce first and second-image determinants

#### *Anarchy, self-help, and intersubjective knowledge*

Waltz defines political structure on three dimensions: ordering principles (anarchy), principles of differentiation (which here drop out) and the distribution of capabilities: it predicts little about state behaviour, does not predict whether states are friend or foes or anything about it.

Waltz's definition without assumptions about the interests in the system does nothing to predict the content and dynamic of anarchy. So, the question is  - is self-help a logical feature of anarchy?

A fundamental principle of constructivist social theory is that people act toward objects on the basis of the meanings that the objects have for them. States act differently towards enemies because enemies are threatening and friends are not. Anarchy and the distribution of power is insufficient to tell us which is which.

Everything depends on intersubjective understanding and expectations. It is collective meanings that constitute the structure which organize our actions.

A fundamental principle of constructivist social theory is that people act toward objects including other actors on the basis of the meanings that the objects have for them.

Actors acquire identities by participating in such collective meanings. Identities are inherently relational. Each identity is inherently a social definition of the actor grounded in the theories which actors collectively hold about themselves.

Identities are the basis of interest - they define their interest in the process of defining situation. The absence or failure of roles make defining situations and interest more difficult, and identity confusion may result.

An institution is a stable set of identities and interests - such structures are codified in formal norms, but have motivational force in virtue of actors' socialization. Institutions do not exist apart from actors' ideas about how the world works.

On this view, institutionalization is a process of internalizing new identities and interest; socialization is a cognitive process, not just a behavioural one. Institutions may be cooperative or conflictual.

Self-help is an institution - processes of identity-formation under anarchy are concerned first with preservation or security.

*The author, page 400, describes security systems - we have the competitive security system that makes realist theory, individualist security system which makes neoliberal systems and cooperative systems that make this:*

States identify positively with one another so that the security of each is perceived as the responsibility of all - the self in terms of which interests are defined is the community; national interests are international interests.

Depending on how well developed the collective self is, it will produce security practices that are in varying degrees altruistic or prosocial - collective action may shift to shared norms than relative power.

What then is a constitutive feature of the state before interaction?
1. The material substrate of agency, including its intrinsic capabilities - for human beings, the body, for states, an organizational apparatus of governance.
2. A desire to preserve this material substrate to survive - they view meanings and requirements of this survival depending on the processes by which conceptions of self evolve.

Are the foreign policies identities and interests of states exogenous or endogenous to the state system? The former is the answer of an individualistic systemic theory for which rationalism is appropriate, the latter the answer of a fully socialized systemic theory. Waltz indicates competition and socialization - the latter. It does not consider identity and interests

### *Anarchy and the social construction of power politics*

The second principle: the meanings in terms of which action is organized arise out of interaction.

Conceptions of self and interest tend to mirror the practices of significant others over time. This principle of identity-formation is captured by the symbolic interactionist notion of the 'looking-glass self' that asserts the self is a reflection of an actor's socialization.

Consider two actors: ego and alter encountering each other. Realists would argue that we should act on the worst-case scenario ... but society would be impossible if this was the case.

What we should consider is the gesture, the physical contact, intent that shapes our first encounter. This process of signalling, interpreting and responding completes a "social act" and begins a process of creating intersubjective meaning. The first social act creates expectations - and then reinforcement. Interaction rewards actors for holding certain ideas and discourages them from holding others.

```

Self-help security systems evolve from cycles of interaction in which each party behaves in ways that the other feels are threatening to the self, creating expectations that the other is not to be trusted.

If states find themselves in a self-help system, this is because their practices made it that way. Changing the practices will change the intersubjective knowledge that constitutes the system.

### Predator States and anarchy as permissive cause

The mirror theory of identity-formation does not tell us why a system of states would end up with self-regarding identities.

Some states may be 'bad apples' - this view suggests that one is power-seeking and others follow suit because anarchy permits this.
It is important that the possibility of predation does not in itself force states to do competitive power politics of their own.

In an anarchy of many, the effects of predation depend on the level of collective identity already attained in the system. If predation already occurs after first encounter, states will be forced. If collective security identity is high, states may defend the victim of the predated state. This is the balance of power. Identities and interests are relationship-specific not intrinsic.

The source of predation also matters - is it unit-level causes (like human nature) or systemic interaction (Nazi Germany) and therefore a response to a learned identity.

The role of predation is consistent with a systematic focus on process - it is what states *do* that determines the quality of their interactions under anarchy. Classical realists emphasize this.

The author suggests that the realist-rationalist alliance 'reifies' self-help in the sense of treating it as something separate from the practices by which it is produced and sustained. By denying states' collective authorship of their identities and interests, this alliance denies the fact that competitive power politics create the very "problem of order" they are supposed to solve - realism is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

### Institutional transformation of power politics

Let us assume that processes of identity have created a world in which states do not recognize rights to territory or existence - anarchy has a realist meaning. What if anarchy exists in a system that is relatively stable - then they do constitute a system that resist change. The fact that worlds of power politics are socially constructed does not guarantee that they are malleable.

One constituted, any social system confronts each of its members as an objective social fact that reinforces certain behaviours and discourage others - self-help systems reward competition and punishes altruism.

The second reason - systemic change may be inhibited by actor's interests in maintaining relatively stable role identities - confirming existing beliefs about the world but also willing to avoid the expected costs of breaking commitments made by others.

For both systemic and psychological reasons, intersubjective understanding and expectations are self-perpetuating, ignoring that through practice agents are constantly producing identities and interests, choosing now the preferences they'll have later.

Now, an examination of three institutional transformations of identity and security interests where states might escape a Hobbesian world of their own making.

#### *Sovereignty, recognition and security*

In a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] state of nature, states are individuated by the domestic processes that constitute them as states and their capacity to deter threats from other stsates.

The principle of sovereignty transforms this situation by providing a social basis for the individuality: sovereignty is an institution and exists only in virtue of certain intersubjective understanding and expectations. These understanding correlate a form of community since identities are relational.

It is only in virtue of mutual recognition that states have "territorial property rights" - functioning as a form of "social closure" that disempowers nonstate actors and empowers interaction among states.

Sovereignty norms are taken for granted that it is easy to overlook the extent to which they are presupposed by an ongoing artifact of practice - they are acting against the background of, and thereby reproducing, shared norms about what it means to be a sovereign state.

If they stopped acting on those norms, their identity as a sovereign would disappear - sovereignty is an ongoing accomplishment of practice, not a once-and-for-all creation of norms. Practice produce identities.

This does not tell us why a structure of identity and interests would arise:
1. The density and regularity of interactions must be high
2. Actors must be dissatisfied with pre-existing forms of identity

Given these conditions, players will acknowledge the sovereignty of the others as they will acknowledge that player's own sovereignty.

Practice of sovereignty will transform understandings in three ways:
1. States will come to define their security in terms of preserving their property rights over particular territories - the preservation of territorial frontiers is not equivalent to the survival of the state. Space affects conceptualization of what states need to secure.
2. To the extent that states internalize these sovereignty norms, they will be more respectful toward the territorial rights of others - it reminds everyone of the costs of violating norms. Power is not an issue - people are just friends!
3. To the extent that socialization teaches states that their sovereignty depends on recognition by other states, they can rely on the fabric of international society and less on individual national means to protect their security - redefining the meaning of others' power for other people.


#### *Competition among egoists and transformations of identity*

A constructivist analysis of cooperation would concentrate on how the expectations produced by behaviour affect identities and interests - the process of creating institutions is one of internalizing new understandings of self and other, of acquiring new role identities. The process by which egoists learn to cooperate is at the same time a process of reconstructing their interests in terms of shared commitments to social norms, transforming into positive interdependence of outcomes into a positive interdependence of utilities. These norms will resist change because they are tied to actors' commitments to their identities and interests - this analysis treats the intersubjective knowledge that defines the game as instantiated by interaction itself.

The debate over the future of collective security in Western Europe may illustrate the significance of this difference: a liberal analysis would assume that the European states "portfolio" of interests has not changed and the emergence of new factors would alter their cost-benefit ratios for pursuing current arrangements leading to existing institutions to break down. They formed institutions, whatever. A strong liberal analysis would suggest that four decades of cooperation transformed a positive interdependence of outcomes into a collective "European identity" in which states define their "self" - interests.


#### *Critical strategic theory and collective security*

Two constraints of an "evolution of cooperation" - the process is incremental and slow, actors realize joint gains and are unlikely to engage in reflection of how to change the parameters of that context.

The evolution of cooperation suggests that actors do not identify negatively with one another - they must be concerned with absolute gains. It is the central balance that can be afflicted with such competitive thinking.

They must have two conditions: one must think of themselves in novel terms, and the expected costs of intentional role change cannot be greater than its rewards.

What these practices should consist of depends on the logic by which the pre-existing identities are sustained - competitive security systems are sustained by practices that create insecurity and distrust.

The author describes Gorbachev.

Such practices cannot transform a competitive security system as it will expose 'ego' to a 'sucker' payoff.


### Conclusion

All theories of IR are based on social theories of the relationship between agency, process and social structure - this question (what theory should be based off) is empirical in two respects: it depends on how important interaction among states is for the constitution of their identities and interests.

What if domestic or genetic factors are more important? Then some theories are better than others.

The answer to the question about what systemic theorists should look like depend on how easily state identities and interests can change as a result of systemic interaction - if the meaning of structure changes so slowly, we should be rationalist - or if interaction is institutionalized completely.

We cannot address this unless we have a framework for doing systemic research that makes state identity and interest an issue - we should not treat identities and interests as given and if we are not interested in identity, perhaps rationalist discourse is reasonable.

This article has challenged one important justification for ignoring processes of identity and interest-formation in world politics.

It's objective should be to assess the causal relationship between practice and interaction (as independents) and cognitive structures of states and systems of state (as dependent variables).

For their part, constructivists have devoted too much effort to questions of ontology and not enough effort to the question of how identities and interests are produced by practice in anarchic conditions.

We should not be method-driven but question-driven.
