## Anarchic Structures and Balances of Power

102 - we must examine the characteristics of anarchy and the expectations about outcomes associated with anarchic realms. To do this, we must draw comparisons between behaviours and outcomes in anarchic and hierarchic realms.

###### I

### VIOLENCE AT HOME AND ABROAD

Because some states may use force, all states must be prepared to do so. Among states, the state of nature is a state of war - in that war may at any time break out. This is inevitable.

This distinguishes international from national affairs - the history of the world.

If anarchy is identified with chaos, destruction and death, then the distinction between anarchy and government does not tell us much - what is more precarious the life of a state among states, or a government in relation to its subject? Among states, the rate of violence is low - within some states, the actual rate of violence in high. The use of force are not sufficient for distinguishing international from domestic spheres.

To look for differences between internal and external affairs we must look elsewhere: in the structure. The difference therein between national and international politics lies not in the use of force but in the different modes of organization for doing something about it - a government can apply a variety of sanctions to control the use of force.

An effective government has a monopoly on the [[Max Weber|legitimate]] use of force - public agents are organized to prevent and counter the use of force.

104

### INTERDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRATION

The political significance of interdependence depends on whether a realm is organized. They are free to specialize because they have no reason to fear the increased interdependence that comes with specialization - if those who specialize most benefit most, then competition in specialization occurs. Kansas depends on Washington for protection and Washington depends on Kansas. The part of a polity bind themselves together by their differences ([[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim 1893, p. 212]]).

Differences between national and international structures are reflected in how units of each system define their ends and the means for reaching them - in anarchic realms units coact whereas in hierarchic realms, unlike units interact. Units are functionally similar in the former and tend to remain but in the latter units are differentiated and specialize a hell of a lot more.

Integration describes the condition within nations and interdependence describes the condition among them.

This leads to the division of labour.

In a self-help system each of the units spends a portion of its efforts in providing the means of protecting itself against others - specialization works to everyone's advantages. Even the prospect of large absolute gains for both parties does not elicit their cooperation so as long as each fears how the other will use its increased capabilities.

In this systems, units worry about their survival and this conditions their behaviour.
In this case, governments are like firms - they must create profits, must maximize joint gains, but they have to survive to do so - must avoid price wars and so on.

106

The structure of international politics limits the cooperation of states:
1. A state worries that it will become dependent on others through cooperative endeavours and exchange of goods and services.
2. A state may worry that it will become dependent on others through cooperative endeavours and exchanges of goods and services.

The more a state specializes, the more they are forced to rely on others.
The higher interdependence of states make them vulnerable.

These structures encourage certain behaviours and penalize those who do not respond to the encouragement - many will lament the development of the division of labour. 

The international imperative is to "take care of yourself" - states do not willingly place themselves in situations of increased dependence. Take a look at defence spending - unproductive, but the reward is maintenance of their autonomy.

### STRUCTURES AND STRATEGIES

Structures cause actions to have consequences that they are not intended to have. Most actors may recognize this but cannot adjust their strategies.

If a shortage of a commodity if expected, all are better off if they buy less of it and distribute shortages equitably. But some will be better off if they lay in extra supplies quickly, most will have a strong incentive to.
If one expects others to make a run on a bank, one's action is to run faster knowing if few run the bank will remain solvent but if many run it will fail.

108

The author uses another example - choosing to drive a private car rather than a train, or people shopping in supermarkets than at corner grocery stores. The result is that they reduce passenger service and decrease the number of corner grocery stores - they may be willing to pay to prevent services from disappearing but nothing an individual can do can affect the outcomes.

These 'large' changes are brought about by the accumulation of 'small decisions' - people are victims of the 'tyranny of small decisions.'

So long as one leaves the structure unaffected, changes in the intentions and actions of particular actions will have a limited effect.

A strong sense of doom may lead to clear definitions of ends, but their achievement is not possible - great tasks can only be accomplished by agents of great capability, that is why states are called on to do what is necessary for the world's survival. States have to do what they believe necessary for their own preservation since no one can be relied on to do it for themselves.

110

The distinction between international interest above national one can only be aptly explained by the distinction between micro and macroeconomics ... but you did this in A-Level so you don't need to write about it

Some hope that changes in the purpose of states would change the quality of international life - states may want reasonable ends, but can't figure out how to reach them. The problem is noting that intelligence and goodwill cannot discover and act on adequate program.

112

According to him ... "for the system would be untenable as such and various sects would undertake the reckless destruction of the human states for the sake of its greater 'happiness'." States cannot entrust managerial powers to a central agency unless that agency is able to protect its client states.

States are insecure in proportion to the extent of their freedom - if freedom is wanted, insecurity must be accepted. Organizations that establish relations of authority and control may increase security as they decrease freedom - the more influential the agency, the stronger the desire to control it becomes.

The force of a government is exercised in the name of right and justice.

Nationally, the force of a government is exercised in the name of right and justice - the force of the state is employed for the sake of its own protection and advantages: war among states cannot settle questions of authority and right; they can only determine the allocation of gains and losses among contenders and settles questions of authority and right; they can only determine the allocation of gains and losses among contenders and settle for a time the question of who is the stronger.

### ANARCHY AND HIERARCHY

Many political scientists allow for a greater and sometimes a bewildering, variety of types.

Anarchy is seen as one end of a continuum whose other end is marked by the presence of a legitimate and competent government. International politics is flecked with particles of government and alloyed with elements of community.

Those who view the world as anarchy for two reasons:
1. Anarchy is taken to mean not just the absence of government but also the presence of disorder and chaos.
2. The two simple categories of anarchy and hierarchy do not seem to accommodate the infinite social variety our senses record - hierarchies are ordered by the social division of labour - anarchies are ordered by the juxtaposition of similar units. Hierarchies are ordered by the social division of labour among units specialising in different tasks.

There may be more categories but that would mean to move away from a theory claiming explanatory power to a less theoretical system promising greater descriptive accuracy.

A new concept should be introduced only to cover matters that existing concepts do not reach. If societies are neither anarchic nor hierarchic, then we need a third principle (see Emile Durkheim's depiction of solidary and mechanical societies...)

116

Do societies that are neither anarchic or hierarchic represent a third time? All categories have borders and if we have any categories at all, we have borderline cases. Clarity of concepts does not eliminate difficulties of classification. Was China from the 1920s to the 1940s a hierarchic or anarchic realm?

Observers may disagree in their answers, but the most important thing is that our expectations about the fate of these areas differ widely depending on which answer to the structural question becomes the right one - structures defined according to two distinct ordering principles help to explain important aspects of socio-political behaviour.

###### II

How can a theory be constructed?
First, one must conceive of international politics as a bounded realm or domain.
Second, one must discover some law-like regularities within it.
Third, one must develop a way of explaining the observed regularities.

Whenever agents and agencies are coupled by force and competition, we expect to find such behaviours and outcomes. They are defined by the approach to politics - [[Realpolitik]] - that the ruler and later the state's interest provides the spring of action; the necessities of policy arise from unregulated competition of states; calculation based on these necessities can discover the policies that best serve a state's interest and so on.

Realpolitik indicates the methods by which foreign policy is conducted and provides a rationale for them - structural constraints explain why methods are repeatedly used despite differences in the persons and states who use them and Balance-of-power theory explains the results that such methods produce.

Balance of power has multiple views - a law of nature, an outrage, a cloak that disguises their imperialist policies and so on.

It helps to, before breaking down this theory, to reflect on prepositions about theory:

1. A theory contains at least one theoretical assumption that are not true or false.
2. Theories must be evaluated in terms of what they claim to explain - [[balance-of-power]] theory claims to explain the results of state actions under given conditions, not foreshadowed in the actor's motived and such.
3. Theories, as a general explanatory system, canmot account for particularities.

118

A balance-of-power theory begins with an assumption about states: they are unitary actors who seek their own preservation and drive for universal domination.

States can use internal efforts - increasing economic capability, military strength, strategies. The external game requires three or more players, and this statement is false for a two-power system, as that will result in internal efforts instead.

States instead will use external efforts - strengthening and growing one's own alliances to weaken an opposing one.

A self-help system is one in which those who do not help themselves or do so less effectively than others will fail to prosper and lay themselves open to danger. Fears of such consequences stimulates states to behave in ways that tend toward the creation of balances of power.

This theory requires no assumptions of rationality - if some do well, others will emulate them or fall. The system won't work if states lost interest in preserving themselves, but as long as some states do, that's fine.

The meaning and importance of the theory are made clear by examining misconceptions of it - a theory contains assumptions that are theoretical, not factual. The theory is criticized because its assumptions are erroneous.

120

For those who believe that a result is to be produced, someone, or everyone must want it and must work for it. If the equilibrium of a balance is maintained through states abiding by rules, one needs an explanation of how agreement on the rules is achieved - a balance-of-power theory is not needed for behaviours explained by psychology or bureaucracy.

Balance of power theory is criticized as it does not explain the particular policies of states - that is dumb. This is not a theory of foreign policy.

122

Balance of power theory is a theory about the results produced by the uncoordinated actions of states - the theory makes assumptions about the interest and motives about state rather than explaining it. What it does explain are the constraints that confine all states - theories alone cannot explain these reactions. They depend not only on international constraints but also on the characteristics of states - how will a state react?

To answer that we need a theory of market *and* state.

###### III


One must ask if a theory is consistent and whether it tells us some things of interest that we would not know in its absence.

Structural theories gain plausibility if similarities of behaviour are observed across realms that are different in substance but similar in structure, and if differences of behaviour are observed where realms are similar in substance but different in structure,

...

We can ask whether expectations drawn from theory can survive subjection to tests. One - can these expectations be subjected to tests?

Two problems: the predictions of balance-of-power theory is indeterminate, difficult to suggest.

Second, the policies and actions of states are shaped by their internal conditions - many effects can be explained away by pointing to effects produced by forces that lie outside of the theory's purview.

So what can we do?

[The author explains what we can do... surprisingly.]

Bandwagon and balancing are in sharp contrast. If two coalition forms and one of them weakens, we expect the extent of the military preparation to slacken or its unity to lessen - the breaking apart of a war coalition.

Only if survival is assured can states safely seek other goals as tranquillity, profit, and power.

Secondary states, if they are free to choose, flock to the weaker side as it is the stronger side that threatens them. One the weaker side they are more appreciated and safer if the coalition they join achieves through defensive or deterrent strength to dissuade adversaries from attacking.

The theory depicts international politics as a competitive realm - do states develop the characteristics that competitors are expected to display? The effects of competition are not confined narrowly to the military realm.

The close juxtaposition of states promotes their sameness through the disadvantages that arise from a failure to conform to successful practices - this acceptance of so-called rules of state behaviour.

From the theory, one expects states will engage in balancing behaviour - a tendency towards balance. The expectation is not that a balance will be maintained but that balance will be restored eventually. Balances of power then form.
