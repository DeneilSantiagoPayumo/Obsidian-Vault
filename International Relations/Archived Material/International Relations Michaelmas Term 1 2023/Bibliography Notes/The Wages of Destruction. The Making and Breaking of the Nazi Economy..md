## What does this passage (BRITAIN AND AMERICA: HITLER'S STRATEGIC DILEMMA) cover?:

## A collection of key ideas from the text and historical sequences

### Britain

Both Britain and America, in the medium term, had huge economic potential that must be counteracted against. Britain must be dealt with before America could intervene.

"Germany's only hope of mounting a direct challenge to the supremacy of the Royal Navy was to embark ... on the design and construction of what British naval strategists referred to as a 'freak' fleet." (398) These boats required copper and rubber which were in short supply, and low concrete infrastructure.

For lack of labour and raw materials, in advance of the attack on France priority was given to the army and Luftwaffe.

Germany managed to do some amount of sinking (2 million tons between June 1940 and March 1941) but the Enigma decrypts, aggressive new convoy tactics and the Americans swung back the balance.

Germany looked towards the Luftwaffe but they were inadequate to the task. Heavy bombers were needed.

Britain, without weapons but still with the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, decided to create about 4,000 medium and heavy bombers. They attacked Italy in East Africa, Ethiopia from the Fascist regime and more.

This ensured that "the African possessions of Italy, France and Belgium would not be combined into a single Axis empire and consolidated Britain's grip on the vital Suez Canal zone." (402)

### America

"Alarmed by Germany's bid to overturn the balance of power in Europe, the Roosevelt administration, backed by a bi-partisan majority in Congress, took urgent steps to transform the United States into the pre-eminent military superpower that it remains today." (402)

Roosevelt created a manufacturing base, a military-industrial complex with 50,000 aircrafts per year (numbers plucked out of thin air). Then, the Two Oceans Navy Expansion Act which laid the foundation for the vast carrier-fleets with which the US projects force into every corner of the globe.

The premise of British strategy was that Britain would pay for as much as it could but that 'when we can pay you no more you will give us all the same.'

What allowed Britain to dramatically close the gap on German armaments production in the early years of the war was the readiness with which it could draw on the Empire and the United States ... imports from abroad ... accounted for no less than one-third of the British war effort. (404)

As early as 1940s, British and Americans moved towards a strategy to defeat Germany in the air war through production of aircraft and aero-engines.

France was pivotal as it had aircraft and aero-engine industry. Germany inherited their factories when France fell in June 1940, Britain inherited France's orders. They were expecting no less than 10,800 aircraft and 13,00 aero-engines. There was also America's own gigantic rearmament programmes which tilted the balance against Germany. It even stretched America's industrial resources.

To not distract from morale, a news blackout was imposed in relation to the destroyer deal, and there were not any news reports of America's rearmament efforts. The public needed reassurance.

France agreed to produce 3,000 aircrafts. Reich Air Ministry was anxious, and France argued they needed aluminium and coal for the craft yet Germany could only promise 4k out of 120k tons of coal. Germany had received 78 aircraft from France and Netherlands whereas Britain had delivery of 5,012.

Additionally, labour productivity in these factories were so low that it took four times as many workers to produce the same plane in Germany.

### Other industrial mishaps

There was just a massive gulf in aircraft deliveries and also energy supplies. "Whereas the Anglo-American alliance was energy rich, Germany and its Western European Grossraum were starved of food, coal and oil." (411)

"The mobility of Germany's army ... depended on annual imports of 1.5 million tons of oil" ... "the victories of 1940 ... added a number of heavy oil consumers to Germany's own fuel deficit." (411)

German occupation threw France into an era before motorization.

On the other hand, Britain produced barely 1 million tons of synthetic fuel per annum but made up for this by importing oil at a phenomenal rate. (1942, 10.2 million tons) "This was five times the amount received by Germany from Romania."

The net deficit of the core countries of the German Grossraum amounted to only 11 million tons. (413)

As quantity of coal fell, the production of steel in the Lorraine and northern France plunged.

There were huge industrial production problems. The real issue was coking coal - steel production could not be fully recognised until coal production has increased. Coal mining was still a high labour intensive industry, dirty, dangerous and underpaid and the Wehrmacht draft took the best young men, leading to a loss in productivity.

The loss of food supply was constrained too, making the labour productivity nearly useless. Farms of Western Europe depended on draught animals and labour of farm workers but a loss of animal feed, fertilizer and more lead to a disastrous chain reaction.

A shortfall in European harvest mean that unless Germany finds more sources of grain, they had to slaughter the livestock herd. "In Belgium and France, the official ration allocated to 'normal consumers' of as little as 1,300 calories per day" which led to the black market.

Only with access to resources such as net agricultural surpluses, coal, iron and metal ores, and oil could Germany face a long war against Britain and America.

A step in this direction, the Tripartite Pact also committed to mutual assistance in case they were attacked by an external power, but this confirmed the aggressive intentions of the Axis powers. The only thing that could've stopped it was the Soviet Union alliance, which required a reconciliation of the Japanese-Soviet antagonism.

By the autumn of 1940, Germany depended on delivery of raw materials, fuel and food which was hard - Goering ordered that deliveries to the USSR should have equal priority with the demands of the Wehrmacht.

This USSR attempt of 'buying off' Germany lead to Hitler believing that military conquest of the USSR was the key to victory in the war. The Soviet Union, he believed, would unleash Japan.

Germany did not have the upper hand in a long war against Britain and America. The chronic shortage of oil, the debility of the European coal mines and the fragility of the food chain, made it seem unlikely that Germany would in fact be able to 'consolidate' its conquests of 1940 without falling into excessive dependence on the Soviet Union. Even if this were possible, the combined manufacturing capacity of Britain and America vastly exceeded the industrial capacity currently under German control and this, in turn, spelled disaster in a protracted air war.
