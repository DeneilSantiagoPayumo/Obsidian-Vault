This passage covers Hitler's reaction to, and attempts of consolidating power.

## A collection of key ideas from the text and historical sequences

### How Hitler systematically destroyed his opponents:

##### The legal side:
* Expectation of anti-socialist repression, Hitler affirmed that "I will shake hands with anyone who is committed to Germany..."
* Legalised the destruction of German federalism with two 'laws for the coordination of the federal states with the Reich' (115)
* Took on the role of imperial commissar and conferred powers back to Goring, laying power to the federal authority. The Reichsrat was defunct.
* Hitler was afraid of a falling back into old habits - moving to legal bureaucratism.

##### The left and Hitler's conservative allies:
* The NSDAP (Nationalist-Socialist German Workers Party) lambasted the 'reactionary' and 'class snobbery' conservatives.
* **7th May** Ernst Oberfohren was shot dead. Probably murdered.
* A series of camps were created - "The purpose of these early ventures was to persecute the political rather than the (perceived) racial enemies of the regime." (116)
* Concordant with tohe Roman Catholic Church - church freedom of worship, right to levy church taxes, run affairs but "new bishops were required to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Reich on taking office. ... forbid clerics ... from any kind of political activity." (116)
* Enough power to pass the program, appointing Fritz Reinhardt as state secretary in the Finance Ministry. He announced a series of armament expenditures to get Germans into work.
* To fund this, printing money to pay workers and also nationalizing German industrialists to make them instruments. The major German economic institutions were side-lined from decision making.

##### Turning to the world around him:
* Preoccupied by the danger of a Franco-Polish preventative war, and there were also intelligence reports of a possible Russo-Polish reproachments. Must improve relations with the western powers.
* Protested his pacifist intention - emphasised the 'war veteran'
* Championship of the Olympic games
* Bluffed the west to think that rearmament was a slow process when it was actually very fast - 'bigging-up' the German air force as a deterrent against Britain.
* Viewed the USSR as an ideological danger, keeping lines to Moscow open as it may restrain Warsaw from launching an attack on Germany and to lull them into a false sense of security.
* Exceptions: Austria, with supports of unification, fearing the influence of 'Viennese Half-Jewry' and 'Habsburg Legitimists' that resulted in retaliation - forced into the Austrian Legion
* Czechoslovakia - nothing more than a Franco-Russian thorn. explored the possibility of reapprochment to break the ring of encirclement around Germany.
* Needed to tone down domestic violence - instructed the SA, SS, and the NSDAP to avoid attacks on foreign cars and individuals. The fundamental nature however enraged people. Also, British and American correspondents who were subject to a policy of intimidation from Nazi authorities.
* Hitler was very aware - went through a policy of disseminiation of Mein Kampf abroad. and restricting edits.

##### More on relations with Jews:
- He was reluctant to pursue a coalition against world Jewry and pillars of the global order.
- He believed there was a Jewish conspiracy at the heart of a negative foreign press campaign. In these early days, the Third Reich encouraged Jewish emigration to Palestine - looked for help to German and World Zionism to increase number of immigrants to the *Yeshuv*.
- Hitler is ambivalent about the emigration of German Jews - used the reluctance of powers to accept Jewish refugees to lambast them them for hypocrisy. He wanted to hold German Jews as ransom for good behaviour of world Jewry.
- Tension running through his policy - wanted to make life difficult for them to enable an evolutionary solution but wanted to keep them for hostages. Nearly derailed his plans - Bernard S. Deutsch spoke out against holding games in Germany.
- Another minefield - the role of German-Americans who constituted by far the largest group of *Auslandsdeutschen* - did not want to interfere in internal affairs. To not interfere in Washington's internal affairs and alienate them, The American NSDAP-Ortsgruppen was disbanded and the League of the Friends of the New Germany (the Bund) was put in place - subject support by the right but anathema to the American mainstream.
- Wanted financial relations with Washington - needed to reduce debt interest payments on loans, needed to import raw materials. Wanted deeper forms of economic cooperation in Europe - feared the rise of non-European economic actors. Wanted to boycott the export of machinery to these rising powers.
- Forbade attacks on Roosevelt and his government, dampen the fire he set with the world Jewry. He did not know that Roosevelt was opposed to him.

### The 'Elevation' of the German People
- Hitler wanted to maintain the effectiveness of the administration and economy, preventing interference by party-appointed incompetents.
- Eased off on enforcement of Nazism at the local level if this cut across economic productivity and smooth functioning of the state.
- He wanted inner acceptance and reproduction of the new order.

- Done through:
- Targeting German Jewry, excluding them with laws such as 'Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service' (April 1933) that attacked and alienated jews. He was unsure of half or quarter jews.
- Attack on the disabled and those of hereditary illnesses - a drain on state resources and a threat to the physical health of the German people. "Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring" which sterilised those suffering from these things. When finding out of the death total, he moved to radiotherapy.

- Increasing quality of life:
- German Car ownership, tax relief for new vehicles, the Ford Car
- The aeroplane, air travel - construction of a huge airport
- Provision of wireless sets (radios) - Goebbels corralled some twenty-eight different companies to create an affordable radio, an instrument not only of propaganda but also of consumption.
- Leisure - communion with the landscape, package tours to those in the countryside.
- Natalist policies - 'Mother's Day', decorations lining with number of children a mother has, ban of abortion, divorce made easier to encourage remarriage, tightening laws on homosexuality, Reinhardt program offered loans that would have a quarter remitted at the birth of a child.
- Education - 'political detoxification' - physical and mental toughening, enthusiasm of sporting activities to make the Third Reich shine, and to make 'racial toughening.'
- Gave a subsidy for the museum - humanistic education against demands for technical training, associating present-day Germans with cultural achievements. Supercharged art development and music development - Richard Wagner monument.
- Hitler did not neglect popular culture but intervened often for aesthetic reasons - avoiding production of any films that complicated Jewish policy
- Agrarian policy - production of foodstuff, rationalize German farming, supplant the old aristocracy, introduction of Reichserbhofgesetz (State Hereditary Farm law) and wanted to support the farming sector - excluded Jews and Africans from farming, placing those of tribal blood on these same levels - reduce rural populations but improve otherwise. Expanded supply of land, capture of new territory - extensive farming on a large scale.

The role of the state here for Hitler was to give the 'patients' enough 'injections' to revive him - two stimuli, one though public work and other through house repairs (multiplier effect) but despite the success of these policies, afraid of unemployment, creating thus the Winter Relief Project and 'camouflaging' rearmament, taking Germany out of Geneva Disarmament conference and League of Nations (october 1933) and dismissed the danger of 'sanctions' - willingness to receive the Soviet ambassador. He aimed to co-opt the Poles for a junior partnership, made relations with Warsaw and so on. 

#### Guns and Butter

- Even if unemployment continued to fall, the economy was in dire straights - huge rearmament and infrastructural contracts kept foreign currency flowing slowly.
- Tension between spending needed to fuel recovery and savings which was to fund rearmament.
- Guns, not butter - not jam today but war tomorrow. Save to finance houses, travel and cars.
- A threat from the right from reactionary elements to win Hindenburg back to their side. 
- Hitler's domestic enemies - 27th June 1934 Blomberg and Reichenau persuaded him that the SA was planning a coup against the army, Goring's research institute conducted surveillance of domestic and foreign targets.
- Decapitated the right - ordered the arrest of Papen's associate Dr Edgar ung.
- Hitler had no illusions under how the murders had gone down - Hitler made efforts to blacken the reputation of Rohm and his circle by emphasising homosexual tendencies and foreign influences.
- Elimination of the SA restored domestic stability to the Reich after a period of cleansing and upheaval.
- Dealt with Dollfuss - a group of Austrian SS members convinced Hitler that they could stage a putsch with the assistance of parts of the military and the police. There was a festival - jews were now banned from performing (festival of Bayreuth) and more.
- Failed coup - dim view of local Nazis and Austrians. Did not associate with them. Tightened grip on Germany, the SS replaced the SA as the most important military party institution. Hitler elevated the Reichfuhrer SS to a position that of the chief of the staff of the SA - the SS took a far more dominant role in the Third Reich.
- Elimination of the Papen wing of the conservative opposition left Hitler free to capitalize on the illness of Hindenburg, no one to claim his legacy. Therefore - the draft of 'a law on the head of state of the German Reich' which amalgamated the office and powers of the presidency with those Hitler already possessed as Fuhrer and Chancellor after Hindenburg.
- Then: "Heil Hitler" - a cult of personality, of greeting. determined to avoid the kind of exaggerated cult of his personality which would ridicule him.
- Lot's of angry Germans - 10 percent voted against him, but really his authority was 'more or less absolute'.
- "Where the state administration failed to deliver, Hitler ordered ... the establishment of alternative structures". (137) Hitler petitioned for greater activism, leading to: a court around Hitler and its manifestation in exercise of authrotiy - "the greater the authority vested in the leader the more important that space will be."
- Hitler was preoccupied with his mortality.

Limits to power: not yet a totalitarian state as mere outward conformity without inner conviction was worthless. Structural reasons - churches and the foreign office and the army hated him.
A highly symbolic new pan-German citizenship law - merging the interior ministries of the Reich and Prussia, imperial reforms - dividing Germany into demographic rationalities which failed as local actors preserved their power and identity.
The bureaucrats dragged their feet - routine explosions, a lost of tickets in the system. "These problems were greatly aggravated by endemic personal rivalries and high political manoeuvring" as the SA and the SS faced against each other with countless arguments over who was subverting the will of the furher.
