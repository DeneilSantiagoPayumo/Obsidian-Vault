## The Challenge of State-Building in Africa

12-13

The problem facing state-building in Africa has been to project authority over inhospitable territories that contain low densities of people.

After all, Africa had only 6 to 11 percent of the world's population in 1750.

Relatively low population densities in Africa have automatically meant that it has been more expensive for states to exert control over a given number of people compared to Europe and other densely settled areas.

In only a few places in Africa are there ecologies that have supported relatively high densities of people - these states have been periodically able to exercise direct control over their peripheries. Ecological conditions otherwise do not allow high densities of people. More than 50 percent has inadequate rainfall and only 8 percent of the continent has a tropical climate.

13-14

This is due to two factors: first, African countries have quite varied environmental conditions. Therefore the models of control a state must develop will be different than other European and differentiated zones of the world. Second, it is expensive to project power over distance because of the combination of a peculiar set of geographical features.

The daunting nature of Africa's geography means that the region was only colonized in the late 1800s. The Europeans found it easier to colonize Latin America.

14-15

Leaders had to confront three sets of issue: the cost of expanding the domestic power infrastructure; the nature of national boundaries; and the design of state systems.

### The European Experience of State Consolidation

The African experience of politics amid large supplies of land and low population densities while confronting an inhospitable physical setting.

However, starting in the fifteenth century in Italy, population densities increased - European nations competed for territory, a tendency that makes sense if population density is relatively high and vacant land is non-existent. [[Bringing the State Back In|Charles Tilly]] notes that one of the central reasons for the creation of relatively centralized state apparatuses in Europe was the "continuous aggressive competition for trade and territory among changing states of unequal size, which made war a driving force in European history." Wars of territorial conquest have been central to the formation of particular types of state because they can create a life and death imperative to raise taxes, develop infrastructure and enlist men as soldiers.

Because European states were forged with iron, it was critical for the capital to physically control its hinterland.

Tilly notes that rules bargained directly with their subject population for massive taxes, military service, and cooperation in state programs, taking steps  of profound importance: a movement towards direct rule ... places representatives of national state in every community and expansion of popular consultation in the form of elections, plebiscites, and legislatures.

The constant threat of war and the need to protect valued territory meant that the physiology of the state forced leaders to put emphasis on control of remote areas that could be lost in battle.

Tilly says:

Successful European state development was characterized by profound links between cities - the core political areas - and the surrounding territories. The growth of state was correlated with the development of significant urban areas. So profound has been the ties between the major cities (the opportunity for rules to collect revenue and bypass landlords) that the roster of great cities that have dominated the western world such as London, Venice and New York stand as proxies to the rise and fall of national powers.

16-18
### Understanding African Politics

By 1975, Africa had only reached the level of population density that occurred in Europe in 1500.

The ramifications of lower population densities can be seen in the very different history of relations between capitals and their hinterlands. 

The author discusses population density.

The Europeans did create many urban areas after colonizing urban areas, but these cities did not serve the basis of state creation because the colonizers were not interested in duplicating the power infrastructure which bound city to hinterland in their homelands. The cities served the needs of the colonizers.

Europeans created capitals that moved power toward the ocean and away from the interior centres of power that Africans had slowly created, exerting control over part of their surrounding territory. Lagos, thus, became capital of Nigeria rather than Ibadan.

18-19

Once the capitals were created they didn't begin to immediately begin to extend power. It was only in the limited number of settler colonies that the colonial state's reach was extended in a comprehensive manner. In South Rhodesia, the presence of a relatively large number of white settlers who saw themselves living permanently in Africa ... propelled the creation of an efficient and brutal state that protected settlers from market forces while dispossessing many Africans of their land.

During the terminal colonial period, politics became national as nationalist movements emerged. Neglect of these rural areas by colonial government and a mobile dispersed peasant population deterred most politicians from investing in mobilizing the rural area.

19-20

The nationalists received states that were appropriate to the way they had conducted their politics: urban with few links to the surrounding countryside where most of the population lived, marginalizing peasant populations and providing urban groups with access to many resources allocated by the state.

After independence, many African countries made significant progress in extending administrative structure over their territories, but found physical control over substantial parts difficult. Africans depended on rain-fed agriculture and smallholders are less integrated into the cash economy, so they were less controlled.

The log economic crisis African countries experienced since the late 1970s has caused an erosion of government revenue bases and their ability to project power - even the most basic agents of the state like tax collectors are not to be found in rural areas.

An appropriate capstone to the comparison between Africa and Europe is their different traditions involving the most dramatic action typically associated with a state: warfare.

The primary object of precolonial Africa was to capture people and treasure, not land which was available to all. In contrast to European states that needed to mobilize tremendous resources from their own population, precolonial African leaders mainly exploited people because war was to take women, cattle and slaves.

African states never had the security imperative to physically control the hinterlands in the face of competition from hostile neighbors.

21-23

### The Extension of Power in Africa

As [[Max Weber]] states, the primary characteristic of a state is its monopoly on the legitimate force of violence in Europe. 

23-24

This European experience is not the case in other regions of the world. Many other regions of the world share the African experience of having significant outlying territories that are difficult for the state to control because of relatively low population densities and difficult physical geographies. In Mexico - the hills are associated with violence and the plains with docility. In Southeast Asia, the divide between centre and periphery is often pronounced.

The traditional tools of POLSCI that stress leadership decisions, institutional structures and systematic considerations can be used.

State consolidation in Africa can be understood by examining three dynamics: the assessment of the costs of expansion by individual leaders; the nature of buffer mechanisms established by the state; and the nature of the regional state system. Only by understanding all 3 is complete analysis possible.

24-25

### Costs

All leaders face costs when trying to expand their writ of authority.

Given the lack of a security imperative, African were able to make much more nuanced calculations about the costs and benefits of broadcasting power. The extension of authority always costs something.

The exact nature of the cost depends in part on how far power is being broadcast.

Consolidation of rule is also a function of how the state system defines territorial control. Consolidation may only be the investment in enough security assets to secure an area physically while other states may have to make extensive investments in such areas like roads. Thus, African leaders seeking to extend their power will face a variety of costs.

The implications of understanding the extension of authority as a series of different costs are significant. For instance, the cost calculations of African leaders are radically different than those made by Europeans. In Africa, conquest and consolidation are different processes because wars were not primarily not over territory and the end of wars did not leave infrastructural residual.

### Boundaries

Boundary politics - defined as attempts by states to mediate pressures from the international system through the use of buffer mechanisms to maximize their authority over territory is important. States can and do lower the costs of controlling a territory by developing a set of boundary institutions.

The particular institutions that mediate the pressures from the international system become of special concern to weak rulers. In many ways, the most consequential buffer mechanism is the territorial boundary that mediates political pressure. The traditional view of African boundaries is that there are a weakness because they have remained unchanged.

26 - 27

In fact the system of territorial boundaries have been critical to the particular patterns of African state consolidation have been seen as a tremendous asset. Far from being a hindrance to state consolidation, African boundaries have been the critical foundation upon which leaders have built their states. In addition, the territorial boundaries help shape other buffer institutions.

Understanding this precise manner in which pressures are mediated by state structures offers a way to move beyond grand theorizing to developing concrete propositions.

### State Systems

27-28

The study will concentrate on the state system that successive African leaders constructed in order to further their own efforts.

Tilly's analysis is so successful because he develops a convincing picture of the international context of state development by focusing on the continual threat of war that all nations faced. There is a need to understand the international context African states face - it is important to recognize that the international system was simply not a given. Rulers in Africa created a particular type of state system in order to help them confront the peculiar difficulties they were having in exercising their authority.

Simple cost-calculations are not enough.

That African states were still strong enough to affect the world is something taken lightly.

### Costs, Boundaries and State System

Maximum analytic leverage is gained when the interplay between the three are understood.

The cost of territorial expansion can be manipulated by states changing the international understanding of what it means to control territory.

29-30

### Continuities in African Politics

We offer an approach: the colonial interlude was brief and it is necessary to study lines of continuity between precolonial politics and the modern era. At the same time, placing colonialism within this context has been stressed by historians who note colonial rule's artificiality, Africans' role in modifying it through protest and more.

That said, the imposition of colonial rule changed everything.

```ad-quote
title: More on that....
"The basis of the postcolonial state in Africa is the colonial state."

```

This fail to understand the course of African politics is unacceptable.

As some African states break down and the façade of sovereignty that was erected crumbles, it is more apparent to understand the past. It is reasonable to understand what the colonialists did and did not change several decades ago if a more indigenous alternative to the nation-state as theorized, designed and imposed is to be developed.

We must understand the drama of state creation.
