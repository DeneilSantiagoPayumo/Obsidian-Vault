## CONFUCIAN STRATEGIC CULTURE AND THE PUZZLE

1 For Chinese civilians, one argument stands out: China has not behaved aggressively toward others throughout history and will continue to be a pacific power after it has risen on today's world stage.

The West they argue is quick to use force but China has always shunned violence.

2 International analysts have long subscribed to the notion that Confucian culture has constrained China's use of military force.

3 There has been few studies on it.

### THE CENTRAL QUESTION

To what extent does culture influence a state's use of military force against external security threats?

Structural realism holds that anarchy pushes states to engage in power competition and use force when necessary. Cultural theories hold that ideational factors such as culture can transform the harmful effects of anarchy and have an independent effect on state behaviours.

4 In the extant literature, there are two strands of explanations: Confucian pacifism and cultural realism.

Confucian pacifism depicts Chinese use of force as reluctant, reactive and defensive, prohibiting the use of violence in statecraft and prescribing peaceful, non-coercive means in resolving disputes.

Cultural realism sees Chinese use of force as eager, proactive and offensive - that China had a strand of realpolitik strategic culture, China viewed conflict as inevitable, and in times of superior strength, they preferred to pursue an offensive, expansionist strategy that involved extended campaigns. In times of weakness, they adopted a defensive grand strategy, even an accommodationist grand strategy that entailed territorial concessions, economic incentives and peace treaties.

5 Structural realism on the other hand holds that culture has little effect on how states behave in the world. The theory argues that the distribution of power accounts for state behaviour, that the material structure of the system exerts overriding influence on state behaviour,

China can see all three, as we will find it.

It presents a 'most likely case' for culturally contingent explanations, and a 'least-likely case' for structural realism, arguing that structural imperatives force a state to be aggressive.

## THE MING TRIBUTE SYSTEM

This chapter will analyse the Ming dynasty's interactions with secondary states under the tributary framework - the tribute system for many symbolise the non-violent and noncoercive aspects of the Chinese world order.

Foreign states accepted Chinese superiority because of the cultural attractiveness of a higher civilisation.

The view of a benevolent tribute system is widespread - hegemonic but not based on coercion or territorial expansionism.'

The author dislikes this, arguing that military force is crucial to enforcing the tribute system.

### THE TRIBUTE SYSTEM

Under this system, foreign states were attracted and voluntarily became vassals - adopting the Chinese calendar, with investiture to enhance the legitimacy of the local rulers.

They sent in embassies to pay tributes to the Chinese emperor and the Chinese emperor lavished them with goods and luxuries.

There was a security function - by allowing foreigners to pay tribute, they would be turned into civilized peoples and pose no threat.

147 It helped facilitate and regulate trade between China and its tributaries as tribute was the only permitted form of trade sanctioned by Confucian bureaucrats. In their eyes, profits were disdained and according to Chinese accounts China did not profit from tributary relations.

The tribute system functioned as an institution that helped China manage foreign relations, preserve a dominant position in East Asia and maintain peaceful borders.

A benign depiction has to do with scholar's heavy reliance on the historical records: overlooked are the views of the tributary state, wherein there may be less bias - scholars who studied non-Chinese actors noted the sharply different interpretation of the tribute system from those at the receiving end of Chinese power.

Foreigners who came to imperial China noted the role of tribute as a form of Chinese payment for cooperation.

148 Also, economic incentives: trade with China was profitable  but restricted. The enormous economic incentives were a key factor in their decision to accept Chinese supremacy. Because China insisted trade must be done through the tribute system, foreign states had few options: accepting nominal Chinese dominance and the trappings of the tribute system seemed a small price to pay for the huge benefits of trade.

Foreign merchants eager to trade with China disguised themselves as tributary, forged diplomatic letters and reaped handsome profits.

The promise of trade could be use to reward or punish vassal states. Because of dependence, China could use suspension of tributary relationships to discipline unruly state - terminating Turfan tribute as punishment.

149 It was also the threat of military force that kept vassal states in line - when not backed, the system fell apart.

title: About violence
"There could not surely be a stable system without power, sustained power."

Those who accepted supremacy were given privileges, those who did not were defined as inhuman and deserving of extermination.

150 The strong set up a tribute system for the weak to follow. Distant empires were able to keep their independence and remained on the outer rim of the tribute system.

The lesser states of East Asia submitted to China for several reasons:
1. It was an important form of trade
2. Chinese recognition and investiture could boost the legiitmacy of local rulers
3. China served as the guarantor of security and could be called upon for military assistance

## CHINESE POWER POLITICS IN THE AGE OF U.S. UNIPOLARITY

181 China has been a practitioner of realpolitik for centuries: shaped by power position, with Chinese leaders adopting an offensive posture when strong and a defensive one when weak.

### THE HISTORICAL RECORD
The pattern of security policy confirms the expectations of structural realism: Chinese leaders prefer to use force to resolve external threats to China's security, taking on an offensive posture.

Confucian culture did not constrain the leaders' decisions to use force, leaders have been motivated by their assessment of the balance of power between China and its adversary.

182 Central decision makers have looked for opportunities to increase power because they saw the accumulation of power as the best way to ensure national security, The structure of power therein was critical to understanding Chinese strategic choices.

This Confucian pacifism is a myth. No evidence at all. One observes a high level of belligerence towards the adversaries, and in the Song-Ming period when court officials advocated an offensive crusade against the northern "barbarians."

During times of strength, Chinese emperors have sought to expand the country's political, military and economic interests.

183 When Ming power was in decline, the country shifted to a defensive posture - the Great Wall was built *after* the Ming dynasty had repeatedly failed to subjugate the Mongols.

Three themes:
1. Chinese decision makers probed for weaknesses and took advantage when found ... they used *a lot* of force.
2. China's level of coerciveness correlated with its relative power position. In times of strength, China was aggressive and in times of weakness, China was defensive. These low-coercive policies were matters of expedience, necessary to provide breathing space.
3. Chinese war aims were not limited to defensive border protection - offensive motivations were evident in policy debates.

184 Chinese exceptionalism is overstated, resembling moreso the realpolitik behaviour of other countries.

### THE ROOTS OF CHINESE REALPOLITIK

The roots have been an interesting subject.
First image scholars emphasize the role of individual leaders.
Second-image scholars trace it to the internal characteristic of states.
Third-image scholars focus on the structure of the system in which a state is situated, arguing that anarchy forces a state to pursue realpolitik at the expense of other states.

This study supports the structural view. Structural imperatives impelled the country to pursue power for security, resorting to military force to settle disputes.

185 In reality, Chinese pursuit of power overrode the Confucian norms of benevolent state-crafft,

It does not rule out the possibility of non-structural motives for conflict - nationalism, pursuit of glory, factional politics. in all, structural causes carry more weight than unit-level factors.

There's nothing to say that Imperial China was inherently aggressive, just that the root of aggressive behaviour lies in the anarchic structure of international politics. It is similar to European cultures.
