## A collection of key ideas from the text and historical sequences

### The Capitalist threat

Capitalist powers were perceived as likely to destroy the Soviet beacon for communism across Europe to forestall revolution. There was a war scare in 1927 that broke down British relations with the USSR, leading to the USSR to strengthen the economy and defence.

Three scenarios were envisioned of which the USSR must fight the Capitalist powers:

The first being where "the imperialists, having agreed some sort of temporary compromise amongst themselves, organise an attack on the USSR with the aim of deciding by force of arms the basic contradiction of the modern world order - the co-existence of two fundamentally opposed economic system." (258)

It was not until the mid 1930s that USSR defence planning was focused on a specific threat, Nazi Germany and to a lesser extent Japan. The construction of the Baltic-White Sea Canal was aimed at security against Britain, allowing to defend against fishing industry, river shipping points and the ability for USSR naval forces to operate on maritime communication.

The rise of National Socialism in Germany prompted a reorientation of Soviet diplomatic activity toward what appeared to be conciliation with the capitalist powers, with the Soviet Union joining joining the League of Nations in September 1934. (259). At the same time, the USSR sought security agreements against Capitalist powers afraid of the German threat like France or Czechoslovakia.

Some historians believe that Russia was genuinely seeking for 'collective security' from a reemergent Germany. This thought process receives to this day very little support from established historians, but many believes that the Allied powers did not rule out some 'coming to terms' with Nazi Germany if it would delay or prevent war.

Soviet pragmatism is a clear thought, a compromise between the "German" and "collective security" schools.  That said, "many British and French conservatives were afraid of Bolshevism than of National Socialism." (261)

### The Munich Crisis and the Nazi-Soviet Pact

The Soviet Union was less than enthusiastic about intervention and certainly unenthusiastic about a unilateral one ... There was little evidence they were being readied for offensive action of any sort (in the Munich crisis) (261).

Essentially, the first issue is that there was faltering soviet confidence in an effective Anglo-French and Soviet alliance emerging against Hitler's ambitions. Czechoslovakia couldn't rely upon Soviet forces against Hitler, nor can Romania be trusted as a transport network to Czechoslovakia as the USSR had not worked to repair those relations.

The second issue restraining the USSR from action against Germany in late 1938 or 1939 was - "The Red Army was in a state of turmoil, undergoing a massive enlargement after having suffered the loss of experienced cadres during the great purges of 1936-8." (262).

Soviet negotiators noted that the British and French had no plan for war against Germany as they wished to avoid war well in advance. For the Soviet Union, deemed by foreign observers to be unprepared for war, the option of coming to terms with Germany remained. 

The second scenario: where the imperialists start a new world war amongst themselves.

The Soviet Union had not given up on the idea of spreading "revolution" across Europe through force, easier if Capitalist powers were fighting among themselves.

The third scenario identified (1930): a situation were the "prospect of the Soviet Union pursuing the never forgotten international "revolution" from a period of relative strength, where "the adequate development of the revolutionary movement in capitalist society ... might place before us the question of a move towards a military offensive against capitalism in order to further world revolution." (263)

### The Icebreaker Controversy and Soviet Intentions in 1941

The argument that the Soviet Union was intending to attack Germany in July 19941 was presented by a Soviet defector. This caused debate about their intentions.

The USSR sought to dispel rumours abut this.

Firstly, it is apparent that the USSR was preparing for war against Germany ... and that such a war ... would involve inital offensive operations by Soviet forces.
Secondly, it became apparent that the Soviet military leadership had, understandably, considered offensive operations against Germany  in the summer of 1941 and the Soviet leadership had started to intensify propaganda efforts to prepare the Soviet people for war before switching abruptly back to a line of preserving peace with Germany at all costs, presumably in the face of the absence of the necessary military operations. (264)

From Stalin's perspective - the Soviet Union was not in a position to go on the offensive because its armed forces were simply not ready, and thus must provide time.

Hence, the Nazi-Soviet Pact to buy time than the less than two years it had done by summer of 1941. Germany was seen by the USSR as short of strategic resources and would not be foolish to throw away opportunities to receive them in the context of the drawbacks of a two-front war.

In reality, the USSR found itself in a serious military and economic situations with Axis threatening Leningrad and Moscow by 1941. The Soviet regime lost vast expanses of territory, prime agricultural land, industrial plant and more.
