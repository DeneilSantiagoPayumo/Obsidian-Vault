# Basis of argument

What do we mean enable or constrain? For this argument, I take Weber's argument in that power is the ability to exercise one's will over another. International law should be, on paper, a binding contract wherein several nations agree to a contract to impose the collective will on each other. As we will see, powerful states (for this, I take to be any dominant hegemon, as my essay will focus on the US and the UK, both big players on the world stage) are simultaneously constrained and enabled by international law. The question is then: what factors allow state to enable or constrain international law?

I argue that international law typically carries an ethos of legitimacy - the spread of democracy, 'liberating others'. When the dominant state for whom the international law benefits heavily can weaponize the ideological implications for international law, as well as have the military force to enact these international laws, that's when an international law becomes a way for power states to be enabled, not constrained, by law.

Ikenberry

-> The Congress of Vienna - the Napoleonic settlement?
Why did this work? Asymmetries of power - 'pact of restraint' that replaced balance of power.
It identified limits and impulses - no wiggle room (realist theory)

-> Why didn't the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations, not work?
The power of the US did not translate to leverage
It could not be a binding security guarantee
Inability to find cohesion.
Wilson's 14 points - idealist.

What's the difference between the Congress of Vienna and the Treaty of Versailles? Leverage - military power, aura of legitimacy - isolationism. America was not part of the League of Nations - policy of legitimacy. In reality, this argument follows a real-politik or realist-esque lens of which international law is viewed through - international law is just scraps of paper, meaningless. What is important is the balance of power - could France agree to a proper security guarantee? Will they falter? 

In this idea, international law constrained these states from violence - or rather, it enabled Britain (Napoleonic settlement) to go. When the US couldn't sufficiently force other countries to 'back down' hence they suffer.

We can see international law as being a means of which countries gain or reduce legitimacy through warfare. For example, let us consider the case of war. Overall, the world is less violence (in terms of warfare) than ever before. Why? Let's look at *Why States No Longer Declare War* - Jus In Bello. Can we see examples?

Well, Russia has yet to declare an actual war on Ukraine. It's a 'military operation'. There's evidence to suggest that calling and declaring an actual war may spark further involvement, or transform this 'local conflict' to something bigger. Article. NATO response?

However, recently Israel has declared war on Gaza? Why? Well, we could look at the ideological nature of Israel's war - they want a complete obliteration of Gaza (look at quotes). However, Israel is purportedly seeking rights and vengeance after the actions of terrorist group Gaza. Is there an ideological basis to this? Or, by declaring war, did Israel manage to grab reinforcements from NATO or other Western allies like Britain and the US?
 
Additionally, the Territorial Integrity norm. Is this enabling or constraining states? Powerful states? Maybe - economic independencies, declining value of land, national consciousness? Can we see Western states violating this if need be? Yes.  Return of Western colonies,

International law is not coached just in terms of military conflict. What about human rights  like equal rights? Does this suggest that the US does not want to be committed to international law? To some degree yes, but how can the CEDAW principle be enforced?

What about international law that is based on gender? Well, it doesn't really work. The CEDAW principles - women are not officially equal to men. However, to what metric is that needed? Saudi Arabia has signed it, yet they are constantly against against equality. Does this imply that it doesn't work?

Moyn certainly suggests that, but it's important to realise that human rights can be coached from the bottom up - affecting international norms. Affecting legitimacy,  The international human rights regime developed through '**contentious politics**' and bottom-up pressures for change. Affecting human rights from the bottom up. [[Kathryn Sikkink]]. Can it constrain state? From the domestic up, not states attacking each other - that's when it gains legitimacy.

On legitimacy, we can consider the works of Ikenberry - his argument to support democracy, foster international cooperation. Although his language is heavily backed by US centric bias, it does implicitly have a notion of legitimacy - if the state does X, if the US mobilise their powerhouse nature, then international cooperation, international law should be mobilised in their interest to support the US. 

"Its general logic is captured in a cluster of five convictions: (11)
1. One concerns openness
2. There is a commitment to some sort of loosely rules-based set of relations.
3. There is a view that liberal international order will entail some form of security cooperation.
4. Liberal internationalism is built on the idea that international society is, as [[Woodrow Wilson]] argued 'corrigible' - reform is possible and power politics can be tamed.
5. There is an expectation that a liberal international order will move states in a progressive direction, defined in terms of liberal democracy."

International law - trading blocs! All good examples. Idea of legitimacy.

In conclusion, international law on the whole tends to constrain powerful states (see Israel, regulating use of force). However, there are dimensions to which powerful states can exploit the norm of legitimacy - see Israel, see the 'crisis of liberal order.'

# Tackling the principles of international law: [[The Historical Origins of Global Governance]]

Global governance refers to the management of global affairs beyond the sovereign state. It refers to multilateralism.

Need to look at The Congress of Vienna (1814-15).: Britain, Russia, Prussia, Austria
Need to look at the International Telegraph Union and the creation of the League of Nation / United Nations.

Do these constrain or empower countries?
The peace settlement that ended the Napoleonic wars in 1815 - sustained political order

```ad-quote
"The asymmetries of power did provide dilemmas and opportunities that shaped the way the major states negotiated the terms of post-war order. Moreover, Britain and the other major powers did pursue a strategy of mutual restraint, loosely tying each to the other in treaty and alliance so as to mitigate strategic rivalry and the return to great-power war. The post-war alliance exhibited characteristics of a *pactum de controhendo*, a pact of restraint. These mutually entangling alliance relations supplemented and to some extend replaced balance of power as the core logic of order among the great powers of the European state system." (81-82)
```

```ad-summary
What determined the model's success: it identified limits and impulses on institutions, the disparities between institutions, the autocratic character of the states.

The Settlement of 1919: involved in many debates. It resulted in debate, competing issues - "The US did try to use its power advantages during and after the war to secure a postwar settlement" ... "disparities of postwar power ... Shaped important variables."
```

Reasons - how well does power translate to leverage? Sufficient to explain the outcome - binding security guarantee. 

The ability to cohesively agree upon international law - the ability to translate leverage. Britain, France, Italy. Wilson wanted those 14 points. Does it depend on individual character, or can there be a second or third level response?
Overall - issue of power, issue of cohesion.

# Tackling the [[Regulating the Use of Force]]

## [[Why States No Longer Declare War]]
An example of international humanitarian law constraining states.
Does it reflecting changing power dynamics and the use of actors like NGOs or a cosmopolitan regime?

Can we look as Israel? The weaponization of media, 'being in your pocket' - 'dangerous narrative', 16 year blockade.
Why didn't Putin declare war on Ukraine? Legitimate act/

China Uighur
Israel - Palestine / Gaza

American didn't sign the international law for woman's rights - the CEDAW principles. Women are not equal to men - does this suggest that America was afraid of acquiring the conflicts and pressures of international law? They didn't pass the ERA before not enough states ratified it. Does this mean in practice? Flaw in argument - realist arguments.

Israel wants to be seen as the West?

https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/more/media-centre/news/2023/putins-state-of-the-nation-why-russia-hasnt-officially-declared-war-and-what-difference-it-would-make - keep the conflict at the level of a local war, reduce Russia's ability to manage NATO and European powers.

Israel wants the complete destruction of Palestine - but Russia to capture its resources? To 'reclaim independence?'

Norms? Western ties? Othering? October 7th - they got attacked.

## [[The Territorial Integrity Norm]]

Is this a constraint? Or is this a positive?  

232 - Western powers, territorial integrity norm, return occupied colonies? 1948 armistice.

Is this due to international law?

Also, economic trends reduce the benefits and increase the costs of coercive territorial revisionism: (243-4)
1. "The declining value of land as a factor of production in modern economics means that the conquest of foreign territory no longer brings the same benefits that it did in the pre-industrial era." 
2. "Some scholars argue that the occupation of foreign territory is more difficult and costly in an era of national consciousness, and therefore states are less prone toward territorial expansionism."
3. "Finally, some political observer adopt a traditional liberal stance that war generally, and territorial wars in particular, are increasingly being rejected in this century because they disrupt valuable economic interdependencies were quite strong in 1914."
 
"Another concern that has been important in promoting support of the territorial integrity norm among developing states is their recognition that they will probably meet strong Western opposition if they embark on territorial aggression ... In some areas the Western powers sought to promote military balances between states where territorial revisionist wars could occur." (242)

What comes with international law, that is the ability of state to interfere and meet Western opposition, result in military balances? What determines power then? Economic trends? US, UK, Germany - provided support to Israel.

The norm of legitimacy.

# [[International Human Rights]]
## International Law does because it has an effect

Basing the argument around legitimacy - Latin American States are less powerful then hegemonic UK and US states. What changed therefore is a change in the legitimacy of human rights.

As we know, Carter DID NOT start human rights project. Why are the US and UK pay attention? International law, in regards to human rights, changes the legitimacy of international law. Whether or not we argue that it is legitimate and agreeable - domestic in, affecting the norm internalization of the US. Not an example of other states attacking other states. International law expanded with the UNDH is guuchi.

# [[The Crisis of the Liberal Institutional Order]]

### [[The Liberal Order Is Rigged]] 

Argues that: liberalism is going down, Washington should be integrated through domestic and international cooperation, double edged sword - uniquely American social identity, prevent overreach.

Arguments rely on the idea of US being a powerhouse to enforce international law - needs to rely on legitimacy.

## [[The Liberal Order Is Rigged]]

Trump made the US less legitimate but... Like not to the point where the US lost international legitimacy.

Empower state as long as if legitimate? Does international states empower states if its seen as legitimate? Not as much power as the US? Even then, those countries may point to Iraq.

Idea that US would be scared of (WW2 perspective) the admiral of the German navy got off Scott-free because they had evidence of them breaking international law. Because they didn't want that smoke, they let S him go. America doesn't want their reputation hurt.

Legitimacy - harms their ability to use international law.

# A
Precondition of democracy - take international law as part of national law, taking part of national law. The question of sending people off to Rwanda, simply because we've taken international law as part of ... Where explicit rights would be introduced, and there was meant to be a guide for newly independent states.

Susan Marks - who was responsible for writing out and negotiating international law. Matua (who?) suggested human rights as a product of Western institutions are coercively coerced upon, but doesn't give any agency to anti-colonial theorists who were at the forefront of human rights albeit lost a lot of their goals. 

One of the point she makes is that the jurists and lawyers who were negotiating, of course including Roosevelt, one tends to see American domination but busy was Labanese, Egyptian, South American, possibly Indians - not just a product from the West but had their own legal system.

People were thinking in terms of their own legal system and their own customs - yes of course it was all in the language of the West, but it is the product of a multi-national committee and can't be dismissed as a product of Westernism. Doesn't answer the question - can it only be a democracy that respects human rights?

Even a democracy has very different conceptions of human rights (X Gray) - the way they were pursuing human rights, discriminating against black Americans, Nash spoke about the citizen human binary which is at the heart of human rights. A breach of human right with the French and the veil? For some people, the getting rid of the veil was liberating.

The point was that you can have different principles in conflict with each other. But talking about international relations, you have the question that as Rafa suggests that having international law of human rights suggests that we made a qualitative leap from inter-state rights to something supra-national, no in actual something that is bordering on an international society. Or whether it is simply a question that Realists would say that the West is being clever but what is being clever is that they've instrumentalised human rights - not the evolution of an international society, people take up a cause to undermine others. You've got the instrumentalization of the soviets for examples of America's lack of success for economic and social rights, or the Americans, or civil and political rights, or instrumentalising those against the Russians (American and Europeans attacking Russia), one element of the Cold War and this argument, Matua, is instrumentalising them for their own agenda.


Russia is using international law to invoke against Ukraine - the point is that even Russia is using the language of human rights, does that mean they are worthless.

Indirect powers? They're the real power of international law, Realist idea - performative argument. Window dressing, smoke screen argument.

And yet, it means that they are letting themselves held responsible... In providing a hostage to fortune, and whether they want to breach human rights. Signing these things, they've created hostages for their actions - reputation but then they have the hassle of being subject to sanction.

Satellites and technology - we know what goes on. In that sense, perhaps and states are signing up to these things at their own peril. They see advantage in using them against others.

Justice - Hoover, FBI for ages, once said that "Justice is incidental to law and order", committing a crime in order to protect someone else. Justice and law in order...

Restorative? Restitutive? Different religions, different cultures, different civilisation. The question is how relativist can you be? How universalist can you be? If the latter, how do you impose it? How malleable. 

Principles by all other states - first you have the conflict between principles. Very murky! Self-determination framework, proportionality framework, settler occupational state, breach of international state ... five different state. It's enough to get around some big ideas.
