# **Is Global Capitalism Compatible with Democracy? Inequality, Insecurity, and Interdependence**

```ad-abstract
Global capitalism seems to be placing democracy, especially liberal democracy, under considerable stress. Support for populism has surged, especially for extreme right parties with populist and authoritarian programs. Inequality, insecurity, and interdependencen all associated with globalization have grown globally and appear to be key sources of stress. New technologies spread readily by globalization are also a force for destabilization. Do these international forces pose existential challenges to democracy? Liberal democracy rests on a foundation of political equality among citizens; it requires free and fair elections, competition among programmatic parties, political legitimacy from public support, and institutional constraints on executive power and majority rule. Is the rise global capitalism eroding all of these key elements? If so, what can be done about it?

## Article Introduction

Global capitalism is putting democracy under stress.

Support for populism has surged - especially for extreme right parties with authoritarian views. So-called illiberal democracies have grown in number - featuring elections but fewer constitutional checks or protections of individual rights.

What is the underlying source of these challenges: the author claims it is to do with the interaction between liberal democracy and global capitalism. Globalization here refers to the extensive integrated international market in goods, services, capital and labour.

This article is comprised of several stages:
1. This article discusses how capitalism went global
2. Then it talks what democracy seems to require - what are the elements it requires
3. The interaction of global capitalism and democracy - three causal platforms.
4. What can make global capitalism more compatible with democracy?
5. More ideas around future research agendas.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Idea 1 and 2: how capitalism went global, and what is essential for democracy

#### History of Global Capitalism

Global capitalism here is referred to as globalization.

The first wave occurred from roughly 1870 to 1914. The second wave has developed in the past thirty years.

During the first wave (1870s) a global economy was created as Europeans spread their influence around the world. Technological change, industrial revolution, boom in international trade and more. This economy fell apart in the early twentieth century with the two world wars. From 1914-1945, globalization unravelled as countries turned inwards: Protectionism, regional trade blocs and more.

In the second wave, technological change propelled globalization along with US domination - transport costs declined tremendously. See the GATT, treaty of Rome etc. Financial globalisation followed, monetary systems and more.

We need to think about what democracy is to understand how globalization challenges it.

Democracy is understood as the rule of the people - pure democracy, representative democracy, constitutional ones etc. Some scholars argue populism is a new type of democracy, a return to direct democracy, advocating pure popular sovereignty and majority rule. That said, some people argue that it is dangerous: it can disfigure institutions, rules of law, divisions of powers, stretching constitutional democracy to extreme borders whilst being intermixed with nationalism.

#### Ideas:

*Political equality* - citizens have equal political rights and should be treated equally by the state. Non-democracies do not guarantee or respect such equal access to political rights, built on hierarchies with a small elite running the government.

*Free and fair elections* - democracy is intended to translate the people's will into governance and policy, a way of arriving at decisions, opportunities and more.

*Competition among Programmatic Parties* - competition for the people's vote that is necessary for accountability, focused on the provision of public goods rather than personal benefits. They make democracy more responsive to people's needs.

An alternative to this tends to be on two types of systems: charismatic leaders who basically are the party or clientelist parties - parties in a system provide goods for citizens in exchange for their support. For the former - problems of demagoguery and despotism, for the latter - vote buying and patronage and the problems of party cartels.

*Political Legitimacy and Public Support* - great faith in institutions to deliver and secure democracy. Public support confers legitimacy on governments and democratic institutions and legitimacy makes them more stable, effective and durable. It is important for their durability as when publics lose their support, democracies struggle.

*Other liberal elements: constraints on the executive, rule of law, free press*.



### How do Capitalism and Globalism interact?

This thus allows us to understand how elements of democracy are undermined by Capitalism. If these elements clash, they will undermine each other (see [[Karl Marx]]). For some on the right, Capitalism (and not democracy) brings freedom (see [[Friedrich Hayek]]).

#### Economic inequality (1102)

We can look at **economic inequality** - (Wilkinson and Pickett) - where rates of economic inequality in advanced industrial countries have risen.  This breeds resentment and anger that only a small segment of society are gaining from globalisation.

Political equality thus hard to sustain when economic inequality is large - if the wealthy have access to political leaders, they can exert more influence over elections.

We can also look at the COVID-19 pandemic - high skill workers maintain their jobs and can telecommunicate. Lower skill workers are more likely to lose their jobs.

"The problem is that this period of rising within country inequality corresponds to the period of globalization's fastest growth." (1103)

#### Creative Destruction and Economic Insecurity

Schumpeter termed Capitalism's process of dynamism creative destruction that destroys the old and innovates. These technological revolutions and innovations spread in waves over time, producing side effects in social and political life.

The digital revolution can provide a shock to information and communications systems, creating insecurity for those (whether or not they'll be) involved.

Capitalism has brought forth changes in the market - old industries die and new ones emerge, with labour and capital slow to keep pace with these changes. People are worried about the effects of technology that enhance inequality - a primary example being the rise and fall of manufacturing industries in advanced countries.

```ad-quote
In addition, the new jobs produced have often been inferior to the old ones lost; the inferiority concerns not just wages but also the terms of employment, which have bvecome less secure and more temporary in the so-called gig economy. (1104)
```

Global capitalism is disruptive but on a global scale it accelerates this change. The third technological revolution then also is different because it is probably the fastest and most wide-ranging, bringing economic anxiety and insecurity.

Capitalism on a global scale seems to amplify this insecurity since international capital and labour flows are politically destabilizing - economic crises fostered by globalization exacerbate this insecurity. This has led to the development of the welfare state to protect against this.

Embedded liberalism, designed to protect citizens against unregulated capitalism, has come under pressure - slowing or declining welfare efforts and the growth of globalization have increased insecurity and reduced support for people following them. Scholars point these changes to be the rise of populism, foreign competition or more.

Insecurity can be a product of new information technologies - enabling governments to control their citizens and create new fears, generating confusion and fake news, disseminating populist political views. 

#### Global interdependence

Three effects: increasing economic policy constraints on the government, pushing convergence on economic policy choices and creating more need for international cooperation and governance that have ultimately resulted in governments having less control over the economy.

(All 1105)
1. "First, globalization can undercut the government's ability to direct the economy" as policy instruments become restrained and less effective. With an open economy, macroeconomic policy becomes more interdependent.
2. "A second process that might undercut democracy is the policy convergence and consensus that has grown with globalization. As governments around the world increasingly liberalized trade and opened their capital markets, policy converged and consensus grew across parties about the value of openness and to some extent deregulation as well as austerity." This reduces party's abilities to differentiate themselves and compete against other parties on economic issues, generating places for extreme or populist parties to generate support.
3. "Globalization has also raised pressure on governments to coordinate their policies to eliminate externalities" - see regimes like the IMF, World Bank, OECD, EU, WTO that constrain policy choices and impose decisions from unelected elites to the public.

Populist leaders thus call for a return to national priorities and a rejection of global cooperation.

### What can be done

*Inequality* - Is economic inequality a problem? There is some evidence that people just don't care - belief in social mobility may dull interest in fixing equality. Some call for international higher taxes, but that's incredibly hard to coordinate.

*Insecurity* - how are we going to deal with rapid change and innovation? AI is going to have distributive effects on societies. Occupations will disappear and more will arise, but the transition is going to be lengthy. Government policy is likely to be important for the smooth implementation of these. Also, we need tech change for climate change.

*Interdependence* - two ways: reduce interdependence and close the national economy. This may grow regional blocs, political pressure that will force governments even more, and it's not clear if this'll work given such limited openness in the economy. Or, we could make international cooperation more friendly to voters, delivering benefits and democratizing these institutions even more.
