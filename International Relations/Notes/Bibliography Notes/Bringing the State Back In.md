## War Making and State Making as Organized Crime - Charles Tilly

169

If protection rackets represents smooth organized crime, then war making and state making ... qualify as our largest examples of organised crimes.

This essay, then, concerns the place of organized means of violence in
the growth and change of those peculiar forms of government we call na-
tional states: relatively centralized, differentiated organizations the officials of which more or less successfully claim control over the chief concentrated means of violence within a population inhabiting a large, contiguous territory. The argument grows from historical work on the formation of national states in Western Europe, especially on the growth of the French state from 1600 onward. But it takes several deliberate steps away from that work, wheels, and stares hard at it from theoretical ground. The argument brings with it few illustrations and no evidence worthy of the name.

Essentially, thoughtful exploration of European experience will show us that coercive exploitation played a large part in the creation of the European states and that popular resistance to coercive exploitation forced power holders to concede protection and constraints on their own actions.

170

War makes states - banditry, piracy, rivalry, policing, and war making. Mercantile capitalism and state making reinforced each other.

## Double-Edged Protection

The word 'protection'
Someone who produces both the danger and, at a price, the shield against it is a racketeer.

171

Someone who provides a shield and has little control over the danger's appearance qualifies as a legitimate protector, especially if his price is no higher than his competitors.

Apologists argue that governments protection from local and external violence - that the prices they charge barely costs the cost of protection. People who complain about this are "anarchists", "subversives" or both.

Therefore, using this definition, Governments' provision of protection qualifies as racketeering - the the extent that the threats against which a given government protects its citizens are imaginary or are the consequences of its own activities. Governments often simulate, stimulate or fabricate the threat of external war, making the government operate in the same way as racketeers.

How do racketeer governments themselves acquire authority? Political observers like [[Hobbes, the Leviathan]] and [[Machivaelli]] recognise that no matter what, the governments organize and monopolize violence. It makes no difference how we recognise this - as damage to people, or violation of their interests, the distinction between "legitimate" and "illegitimate" force matters not still, as government's stand out from other organizations by their tendency to monopolize the concentrated means of violence. If we take legitimacy to depend on conformity, then these conditions explain the tendency to monopolize force.

Arthur Stinchbombe might fit - "the person over whom power is exercised is not usually as important as other power-holders" with legitimacy as the probability that other authorities will act to confirm the decisions of a given authorities. Other authorities are much more likely to confirm the decisions of a challenged authority that controls substantial force but also desire to maintain an environment for that general rule. A tendency to monopolize the means of violence makes a government's claim to provide protection more difficult to resist.

172

Here's the argument: power holder's pursuit of war involved them ... in the extraction of resources for war making from the populations over which they had control and in the promotion of capital accumulation by those who could help them borrow and buy, with war making interacting to shape European state making.

Those that controlled European states warred in order to check or overcome competitors, enjoying power in expanding territory. To make effective war, they located capital - perhaps by selling capital through conquest, or establishing access to capitalists who could supply and arrange credit, and in imposing one form of regular taxation or another on the people.

State makers developed an interest in promoting the accumulation of capital. Variations in the difficulty of collecting taxes ... resulted in the principal variations in the forms of European states.

173

Really, the distinction produced by violence from the state and that of anyone else is really one of 'legitimacy',. The personnel of states surveyed violence on a larger scale, with assent from their subjects, and collaborations with neighbouring countries. Early in the process, many parties shared their right to use violence - using it routinely to accomplish their ends.

This uncertain, elastic line, appeared in the upper reaches of power. This long love-hate affair illustrates the division - in times of war, managers of full-timed states commissioned privateers and bandits to encourage their regular trooops to take bounty. When demobilized, the continued those practices without protection - turning demobilized ships into private vessels. Sometimes, a king's bebst source of supporters were outlaws.

Really, the distinction between legit and illegitimate users of violence came clear slowly.

Up to that point, Braundel says, maritime cities offered protection to freeboaters: many lords claimed the right to levy troops and maintain retainers. Without calling upon these lords, kings could not fight wars.

The tutors accomplished this agenda through England.

174

Lawrence Stone wrote about the quality of daily life - that there occurred a change in English habits, with the growth of the police force making the monopoly effective in the greatest city and smallest villages.

Tudor demilitarizing the great lords resulted in four campaignss: eliminating their band of armed retainers, razing their fortresses, taming their habiutal resort to violence for the settlement of dispute, discourging the cooperation of their dependents and tenants.

In France, Richelieu began the great disarmament in the 1620s - Louis XIII destroyed the castle of the great rebel lords, condemned duelling, the carrying of lethal weapons and the maintenance of private armies.

The elimination of local rivals posed a problem - beyond the scale of a small city-state, no monarch could govern a population with his armed force alone, or create a professional staff large and strong enough to reac the ordinray citizen.

In one way or another, every European government ... relied on indirect rule via local magnates, potential rivals and allies of rebellious people, but maintained rule and exercised force in their own territories.

175

Eventually, European governments reduce their reliance on indirect rule through: extending their officialdom to the local community, and encouraging the creation of police forces that were subordinate to the government rather than to individual patrons. 

## Protection as Business

In retrospect, the pacification of fractious rivals seems awesome but if a power holder was to gain from the provision of protection, his competitors had to yield. Economic historian Frederic Lane put it that governments are in the business of selling protection.

He distinguished between the monopoly profit or tribute, coming to owners of the means of producing violence, and the protection rent accruing to those customers: Venice allowed specifically for a government that generates protection rents for rits merchants by attackig their commpetitors.

If a price could create a sufficient armed force to hold his external enemies and extract // keep subjects in line, but taxed more he gained a tribute. If the money of those taxes paid by the subjects gave him assurance to world markets at less than the 15 pound shares paid by foreign competitors to their princes - differing only in degree and scale of the reasoning of violence-wielding criminals and their clients.

There was different behaviour we might expect of the managers of a protection-providing government owned by citizens, a self-interested monarch and the managers.

If citizens exercised ownership of the government we may expect the managers to minimze protection costs and tribute, maximizing protection rent. A single monarch may maximize tribute to get as much profit. If managers owned the government, they'd keep costs high, maximimzing their own wages and so on, exacting a high price from their subject and being indifferent to protection rent.

A dominant class (not mentioned by Lane) would maximize monopoly profits as well as tuning protection rents nicely to the economic interest of the dominant class. An autonomous government would maximize manager's wages and its own size, being different to rent.


Lane speculated then that for Capitalism, there are four stages:

1. A period of anarchy and plunder
2. A stage in which tribute takers attracted customers and established monopolies by struggling to create exclusive, substantial states
3. A stage in which merchants and landlords gained more from protection rents than governors did by tribute
4. A period in which tech changes surpassed protection rent as a source of profit for entrepreneurs.


Douglass North and Robert Paul Thomas make stage 2-3 the pivotal moment for sustained economic growth, allowing the accumulation of private property.

Lane's issues: taking taxpayers as 'customers' and insisting the customer had the choice of not paying.

Richard Bean applied this logic to the rise of Euro states between 1400 and 1600, appealing to economies of scale in the production of effective force counteracted by diseconomies of scale in command and control - that improvements in artilery shifted the curve of economies and diseconomies to make larger armies. Military innovation created expensive and large national states.

178

The shift to infantry-backed artilery sieges of fortified cities occured during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries - the inventions of fortifications countered the advantage of artilery.

Nor is it obvious that changes in land war had the sweeping influence
Bean attributes to them. The increasing decisiveness of naval warfare could well have shifted the military advantage to small maritime powers such as the Dutch Republic. Furthermore, such events as the fractionation of the Habsburg
Empire and such facts as the persistence of large but loosely knit Poland
and Russia render ambiguous the claim of a significant increase in geographic scale.

One thing though: different military formats do cost substantially different amounts to produce and do provide substantially different ranges of control over opponents, domestic and foreign.

Until the eighteenth century, the greatest powers were maritime states, and naval warfare remained crucial to international position.  Naval warfare was not the only reason for the bias to the sea - land transportation (before the 19th century) was so expensive that no country could afford to supply a large army or a big city with grain and other heavy goods without having efficient water transport. Rulers fed major inland centres such as Berlin and Madrid only at great effort and at considerable cost to their hinterlands. The exceptional efficiency of water ways in the Netherlands undoubtedly gave the Dutch great advantages at peace and at war.

179

Additionally, those metropolises on the list were outstanding mobilisers of capital.

None of these historians note the importance of capital accumulation to military expansion.

For example, "although the rate of growth in royal expenditures and revenues from 1515 to 1785 for France accelerated after 1600 they rose a lot during the sixteenth century. After 1550, the internal war of religion checked the work of international expansion that Francis I had begun earlier in the century...""

Borrowing and then paying interest on the debt accounts for a huge amount of the discrepancy.

By 1595 the national debt had rose to 300 million Francs, and in 1715 rose to 3 billion Francs.

181

## What do States Do?

Lane's analysis fails to distinguish between the different uses of state-controlled violence:
1. War making
2. State making
3. Protection
4. Extraction

The third item corresponds to protection but the other three involved the application of force - they take on a number of forms, extraction (acquiring the means to do the previous 3) can take place through taxation, plunder and so on. Thus a state that eradicates internal rivals strengthens its ability to extract resources.

The more costly the activity, the greater the organizational residue. The Prussian effort to build an army matching those of its continental neighbours created an immense structure.

In the case of extraction, the smaller the resources and elss commercialized the economy, the more difficult was the work of extracting resources for war - the more extensive was the fiscal apparatus. As Gabriel Ardant has argued, the choice of fiscal strategy probably made an additional difference. On the whole, taxes on land were expensive to collect as compared with taxes on trade, especially large flows of trade past easily controlled checkpoints. Its position astride the entrance to the Baltic gave Denmark an extraordinary opportunity to profit from customs revenues.

182

With respect to state making, a territory populated by religious groups or great landlords posed greater costs on a conquorer than of homogenous culture.

Finally, the cost of protection mounted with a range over which that protection extended.

Thus, the size of the government varied with the effort devoted to the four, but inversely with the commercialization of the economy and the extent of the resource base. The relative bulk of different features of the government varied with the cost/resource ratio of extraction.

The four are very interdependent.

183

A great lord that has made war effectively will become dominant, resulting in an increasing in extraction of the means of war, building up the capacity to extract - entailing the elimination of the rivals and leading to state-making, creating organizations in the form of tax-collection agencies.

To a lesser extent, war making has led to state making through the expansion of military organisations - all these structures checked potential rivals and opponents, loaning resources and technical services to ensure complicance of the rest of the population.

## How States Formed

This analysis has two implications

1. Resistance to war making and state making made a difference, where authorities made concessions that constrained the later paths of war making and state making.
2. Second, the relative balance among war making, protection and etc significantly affected the organization of the states - war making with little other three made a good part in national politics, like Spain. If protection prevailed, oligarchies dominated politics. From the dominance of the state makign made the elaboration of policing and survellience - the Papal state. Any state that didn't put any effort in war making disappeared, but as the 20th century went on, it was commmon for states to sell war-making means to another.

This neglects the external relations that shaped every state - the distinction between internal and external remaining unclear.

1. There were flows of resources in loans and supplies for state making
2. There was competition among states for hegemony that stimulated war makinga nd erased the distinction among war making, state making and extraction. 
3. There was the intermittent creation of coalition of states that temporarily erased these distinctions to force ag iven state into a certain form and position them within the international network.

War in these circumstances became the normal condition of the international system. Wwr served many ends:

A local lord defending the perimeter monopolized the means of violence and increased his return from tribute - external and internal rivals overlapping.


If we allow the distinction between internal and external state-making processes, we can mark the history of Euro state making into three stages: the differential siuccess of some powerholder in 'external' struggles establishes a difference between an 'intenral' and an 'external' arena for the deployment of force, external competition generates internall state making, external compacts among state influence the form and locus of some states a lot more.

For example, the League of Nations and UN simply extended the European based process to the world, creating new states through decolonizing.

This did not create states in the strict European image, internal struggles produced organizational features of Euro states: bureaucracy, representation of wronged interest, parliament whereas states elsewhere developed developed differently: Euro states build their military through sustained struggles with their subject populations and by means of selective extension of protection to different classes within those populations.

States that came about through decolonization have acquired their military organization from outside - supplying military goods and expertise in return for commodities, military alliances or both, the new state harboring powerful organizations that overshadow all other.

The extent that outside states guarantee their boundaries, managers of military organizations exercise power in them - the incentive to seize power over the state as a whole makes that strong.

The old national states of Europe never experienced the great disproportion between military organizations and all other forms that seemed the fate of client states all throughout the contemporary world. : the analogy between war making and state making, on the one hand, and organized crime, on the other, is becoming apt.
