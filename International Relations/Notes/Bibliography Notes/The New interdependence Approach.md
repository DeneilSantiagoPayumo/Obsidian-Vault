# The new interdependence approach: theoretical development and empirical demonstration
## Article Introduction

>[!summary]
>Mainstream approaches to international political economy seek to explain the political transformation that have made more open trade relations possible. They stress how changing coalition of interest groups within particular states and changing functional needs of states give rise to new international agreements. While these approaches remain valuable, they only imperfectly encompass a new set of important causal relations. We now live in the world that trade built - a world where greater interdependence has major consequences both for actors' interests and their ability to pursue those interests. A now body of work, which we have called  the 'new interdependence' explains how these transformations are playing out. The new interdependence stresses a structural vision of international politics based on rule overlap between different national jurisdictions, which leads to clashes over whose rules should apply when. This not only generates tensions, but also opportunity structures that may help actors to better shape potential solutions to these clashes. However, some actors will have greater access to these opportunity structures, and hence greater influence and bargaining - than others. These three factors - rule overlap, opportunity structures and power asymmetries - provide the basis for a compelling understanding of international politics.


What is the relationship between globalization and international political economy? The global economy has rapidly changed from one involving the simple exchange of goods that can be modelled using Ricardian ideas of comparative advantage to a more complex system involving a whole host of new economic activities.

Politically, we have moved from a world market based around trade to a world that trade built. Firms, citizens and NGOS face multiple political demands. These actors are setting rules and responding to other rule - Nike, Google, Facebook and more. Politics of globalization has expanded from struggles over free trade to a complicated fight over the rules and principles that affect how the economic and political benefits.

OEP (Open Economy Politics) approaches see globalization primarily as an exogenic shock that activates domestic interest groups and is filtered through domestic institutions to either support or oppose economic openness.

NIA (new interdependence approach) literature has three claims: (715-716)
1. "Globalization does not take place in a state of anarchy but in a state of rule overlap." - "as national markets become interpenetrated, the rules and principles of market (especially large markets) and global regimes increasingly clash with each other, creating a dilemma for internationalized private actors." These actors will therefore seek certainty and defect from protecting the status quo. Hence globalization destabilizes existing political compromises as rule overlap increases.
2. "Globalization creates opportunity structures for collective actors to form transnational alliances." (716). It creates political channels that actors can use to forge alliances internationally. Actors have more avenues of agencies, and can form formal international organizations.
3. "The NIA view institutions - domestic and international - not just as "rules of the game" but as a key source of asymmetric power. Building on work in comparative politics, it emphasizes how institutions shape the power resources of actors as well as their understanding of their preferences." Therefore, institutions form a larger part of international structure where actors are embedded. 

The NIA describes a world in which domestic and international politics increasingly blur. It views international politics as an iterative and dynamic interaction.

The NIA raises a number of normative concerns. It suggests a world in which strategic actors from IO secretariats to regulators to firms may take advantage of global interactions to undermine domestic blockages.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### GLOBALIZATION SHOCK 717-718

The simple economic account of globalization sees it as involving the exchange of goods and services, with IR literature viewing it as posing three kinds of shocks: exit, openness and cooperation problems.

*State power vis-a-vis business*: with the fall of capital controls and transportation costs, some firms find new exit opportunities. Groups can use capital flight to relocate their investments.

This relationship runs from increased opportunities for economic mobility, so actors with increased bargaining power to take advantage of these opportunities. Governments find that the cost of institutional configuration are higher, causing them to abandon those institutions in favour of institutions that are more congenial to business or fail to adopt such institutions where they are not present.

*Globalization as reshuffling the coalition that either support or oppose continued openness* - the benefits of exchange are unequally distributed.

This relationship runs from the changing opportunities that international trade creates for sectoral groups or collective actors through institutionalized preference aggregation mechanisms to shifts in national bargaining positions. The international shock affects domestic politics through its consequences for primitive group preferences, while national levels institutions remain constants.

*Cooperation problems posed by increased economic exchange*: global markets produce a number of externalities that spill across borders such as environment degradation. On the other hand, there are governance challenges that require coordination across markets to prevent rule fragmentation. Literature focuses on how international organisations can enforce these cooperation problems.

This relationship runs from exogenous changes in the problems faced by states, through changing state preferences over international institutions, to the creation of international institutions designed to mitigate these problems.

These things ignore how institutions may disrupt the political process or transform it - it focuses on a limited number of questions such as national commitment to openness and free trade or such.


### THE NEW INTERDEPENDENCE APPROACH

In particular, the NIA focuses on how political processes shape two outcomes: the rules and principles that govern the behaviour of global market actors and the institutions and policy at the domestic level.


#### Rule overlap (721-722)

```ad-quote
title: 721
"NIA sees interdependence as important because it increases *rule overlap*. As market actors such as firms and individuals engage in economic activities which span territorial borders, they increasingly face requirements from multiple auithorities..." 
```

This generates second level problems as large markets like the US, the EU and Japan and China make extraterritorial claims to influence the behaviour of actors outside their jurisdiction. Firms do not have to play by different rules but find themselves opening up to punishment for violating rules in others.

"Globalization is not characterized primarily by a state of anarchy in which actors face an absence of rules and norms. The process  of creating openness ... has created a series of overlapping authority claims made by a range of domestic and international actors." (722)

In cases of rule overlap, market actors face levels of uncertainty as to the actual rules that govern global market. Rule overlap destabilizes the domestic and global regulatory status quo.

[[Newman and Posner]] (2016) emphasizes the importance of rule overlap in generating opportunities for contestation. Arguments over banking regulation led to competing over authority, and efforts to resolve disputes through common regulatory standards. This heralded a transformation in the Institute for International Finance to one that sought to intervene in the new international standard setting process on behalf of its members.


#### Opportunity structures (722-724)

Globalization offers new political channels for political cooperation and contestation. Within both domestic and international levels, there are actors that both support a regulatory status quo and those that hope to alter it.

"The politics of the NIA, however, is marked by collective actors below and above the level of the nation-state, who increasingly participate *directly* in global politics." (722-723). In short, reform minded actors that seek to upset their policy status quo can now build transnational alliances with partners from other countries, international organisations, and private actors.

"Globalisation then creates new political opportunity structures for these disaffected groups." ... "Globalization expands the platforms for such interactions as groups cooperate through both formal and informal international institutions." (723)

International institutions are potentially important in specific ways - the NIA depicts these institutions as opportunity structures that facilitate cross-national coordination between collective actors.

```ad-quote
title: 724
In short, political contestation now takes place in multiple and overlapping venues, providing opportunity structures that are not necessarily controlled by national governments.
```


#### Asymmetric power

"The combination of rule overlap and new opportunity structures has asymmetric consequences for political power. This is based on the fact that access to opportunity structures and the friction of rule overlap are not equally distributed across all collective actors." (724) If actors have access to new channels, they will be better positioned to forge new domestic and global rules, or block and change it.

When rule clashes occur, they must be resolved and actors with access to the relevant structures will play a very powerful in deciding how the resolution happens. (724)

[[Moschella]] (2016) documents this in her analysis of the role of the EU in the Troika negotiations, having an important part to play in reshaping Greece's political economy. It was only able to intervene thanks to the development of a broader European crisis management system. This strategy has allowed the Troika to shape the domestic status quo.

Inviting scholars to focus on specific collective actors rather than states and to incorporate differences in their power resources. Regulators will lose if they do not have enough resources. Regulators that enjoy power resources will be in a better position to reshape rules either in others jurisdiction.
