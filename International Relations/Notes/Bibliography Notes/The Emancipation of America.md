[[Nations and States in the Americas]]

The emancipation of most of America may be understood as a series of reactions by the settlers to the actions and events that occurred in their mother countries (Spanish-American, British-American), each beginning the process towards independence.

The monarchies that conquered and settled the new world during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were not modern nation-states: the nature of those conquests forged different kinds of relationships: Spanish people were perceived as belonging to different cultures.

The Spanish New World was organized into two legal systems: the republic of Indians and the republic of Spaniards. The Indians became subjects of the Spanish crown in a subordinate status, but the distinction proved impossible to maintain: the Spanish Monarchy was too vast and the lands too populous for Europeans. Over time, economic development transformed it into multi-racial societies in which the Indians entered larger society as cultural.

The English experience was significantly different - although violent, they did not constitute the inclusion of fundamentally different cultures. They hated the Catholic Irish and the North American Indians, so thus they had to be displaced and remain in the margins of society.

Large numbers of African slaves replaced the indentured servants because they were a cheap and more reliable labour force - planters of Saint Domingue imported 30,000 African slaves.

Above this slave majority stood the free people of colour: racially mixed and blacks. Some of them were cultural elites with ties to France. The *grands blancs* constituted the political, social and economic elite of Saint Domingue. In contrast, the *petit blancs* found themselves in an ambigious position: considered to be racially superior to the *gens de couler* but lacked wealth and education. 

The social structure revealed the structural distortion of a slave plantation exploitation society: people were divided by race and socioeconomic status, the petit blancs feared and despised free people of colour (their superior) whereas the gens de couleur feared and loathed the slaves.

The three monarchies governed their American possessions by consent, not force. All three were obliged to grant their settlers greater autonomy as the crown lacked the resources to develop the regions themselves and because the New World offered more economic opportunities. They had a rule of 'benign neglect' - royal power was scarcely felt by the inhabitants of America.

The structure of the Spanish Monarchy was highly centralized - the crown lacked the fiscal and coercive resources to enforce its will.

Native society, which enjoyed rights to land, language and more possessed its own governments known as *republicas*, polities that coexisted with Spanish cities, mestizo and mulatto towns, and rural estates of various kinds.

The Republic of Spaniards, which expanded over time because of miscegnation and acculturation and population growth included countless representative corporate bodies, these corporate entities enjoying a large measure of self-government and transmitting their views to the higher authorities such as the high court and viceroys or directly to the Council of the Indies and the king.

They believed their land to be kingdoms in the worldwide Spanish Monarchy, not colonies.

British America was a consensual empire like the Spaniards but it had a larger white settler population than the French or Spanish. Only the French free people of colour possessed greater rights and liberties than the other Americans, alone enjoying the right to convene local assemblies. The British Americans had more self-governance than the Spanish Americans or inhabitants of Saint Domingue

The French West indies developed a form of self-government by the early eighteenth century - a system of superior councils emerged that proved strong enough to disregard royal ordinances not to their liking: the region offered its minority white population more of both than the people of France possessed.

Life in the new world was determined by the natural endowment.

British America - fertile land, great river systems, low-cost water transportation, loads of property, creating the dynamic propertied class, creating the egalitarian social order.

Spanish America - very low fertile land, thin populated periphery in the extreme south and north. The settled portion of 18th century Spaniards had mountain ranges, jagged canyons, great deserts, vast rain forests, barriers to communication: restricted by the lack of good harbours and by the location of major population and production centres in the highlands away from the coast. Therefore, because of the difficulty of transport and communication, no one communicated with each other unless they were neighbours.

This physical environment determined the society: New Spain had a wealth economy, a multi-racial society whose members were integrated culturally and economically. new Spain was balling, compared to the Rio de la Plata, a thinly populated region that was marginal and isolated.

France - Saint Domingue became the most productive colony in the West Indies, accounting for 40% of France's trade. Its productivity doomed them all to exploitation - 500,000 workers from Africa.

Two contradictory tendencies: the assertation by Americas of a sense of unique identity and the attempt of the Bourbon and Hanoverian monarchies to increase control of their Americas and transform them into profitable colonies.

These colonies identified with their localities that they thought of America - whereas educated members of both communities emphasized the unique characteristics of their land and people, Spanish Americans incorporated their Indian heritage whereas British Americans did not.

Spanish Americans and British Americans viewed themselves as true Spaniards or true Britons, the possessors of all the right and privileges of those people. Spanish Americans derived their rights from Indian progenitors who originally possessed the land, and their Spanish ancestors. British Americans based their claim on self-government on their rights as Englishmen.

Little was accomplished until the end of the Seven Years' War - a world war fought in Europe, America and Asia, changed the balance of power, withdrawing France and leaving both Spain and Britain in control.

They decided to transform their Americas into colonies that they could profit from, like Saint Domingue.

Both British and Spanish Americans objected to the new imperialism - why they objected so strongly (for the British) is not understood. But the British monarchy feared that the colonials would insist on independence and the colonists were convinced that the Hanoverian reforms sought to deprive them of their rights and liberties as Englishmen. Thus, the American Revolution resulted from the inability of the disputants to agree on the nature of the British Empire.

The Nature and process of the struggles for emancipation were as different as the three Americas. The war for this independence became an international conflict. France fielded an army of more than 10k men, Spanish troops harassed the British, and the combination of the two neutralized the British fleet at sea.

The British-American upper class shared moderate goals - they did not challenge the elite. The U.S war of independence was characterized by military engagement, no rural insurrection.

The British-American managed to direct the new nation without serious challenges from other social groups. The US emerged as an oligarchic republic that incorporated other groups into full participation.

The origin of the revolution in Saint Domingue lie in the broader changes of the Atlantic world during the eighteenth century - the cost of aiding these British rebels contributed to the fiscal crisis that destroyed the French monarchy, forced to create the Estates General.

The French revolution influenced the Haitian revolution. The violence in Saint Domingue was initiated by the whites, armed not only themselves but their slaves. The French National Assembly granted political rights to the free *gens de couleur*, the whites temporarily united to limit political power to their race only. The free people of colour armed their slaves to defend their interests, the salve began to fight for their own freedom.

The Spanish upheaval differed from those in Britain and French America.

Spain: reorganized political process (established a small standing army and a large force of provincial militias). They did not imitate their northern brethren by seeking independence. They were certain of the Spanish-American loyalty and signed the Treaty of Paris.

The Bourbon reform did meet opposition: they turned to armed resistance to redress their grievance. The Spanish Americans opposed those innovations that injured them and managed to modify many to suit their interests.

The political revolution of the Spanish world began with the imperial crisis of 1808 - the collapse of the Spanish Monarchy triggered events that culminated in the establishment of representative government throughout the Spanish world: the first step is the formation of local governing *juntas* which invoked the Spanish legal principles that sovereignty, in absence of the king, reverted to the people.

Events in Spain had massive effects in the new world - not willing to accept French domination, the people opposed the invaders, forming a government of national defence. The Spanish national government could not defeat the French without the aid of its overseas territories. The new regime recognized the equality of the American kingdoms and in 1809 invited them to elect representatives to the Junta Central.

The elections enhanced the political role of the municipalities and provided Spanish Americans with the opportunity to participate in government. They invited the American kingdoms to send delegates, extending political participation.

The deputies from Spain and America who made the constitution of the Spanish Monarchy transformed the Hispanic world - an American charter as a Spanish one. The Charter of Cadiz created a unitary state with uniform laws. It enfranchised all men (aside from Africans) without needing any qualifications.

The new charter established representative government at three levels: the municipality, the province and the monarchy. It transferred political power to the local level and incorporated vast numbers of people into the political process.

Civil war erupted because some groups refused to accept the government in Spain that formed local juntas, while others that recognized the new authorities in the Peninsula opposed them.

Civil war erupted in the New World that pitted supporters of the Spanish national government against the *juntas*, the elites against one another. Because all areas of the Spanish monarchy possessed the same political culture, these movements justified their actions on the same ground and in identical terms - because of the imprisonment of the king, they argued that sovereignty reverted to them. Radical Spanish Americans took control when it appeared the French would completely dominate.

The Spanish-American movements arose from a desire to remain independent of French domination - the great difference between the Peninsula and America was that the regions of Spain fought an external enemy whereas the New World kingdoms grappled with internal divisions.

King Fernando's return promised to restore the unity of the Spanish world. The royal authorities in the New World crushed most autonomy movements.

Repression by the crown prompted decisive action by the minority of Spanish America's politically active population that favoured independence.

The restoration of constitutional government made disparate but enthusiastic responses by those of Guatemala and New Spain. Political instability convinced many New Spaniards that it was prudent to establish an autonomous government within the Spanish Monarchy.

New Spain's deputies to the Cortes proposed a project for New World autonomy that would create three American kingdoms - a Spanish commonwealth that resembled the British commonwealth, retaining ties with the monarchy. The Spanish majority in the Cortes rejected the proposal that would have granted Spanish Americans the home rule they have sought for since 1808.

Mexico achieved its independence as many of the New Spaniards no longer supported the crown politically. The newly independent Mexicans followed the precedent of the Spanish constitutional system - they replaced it in 1824 with a federal republic. They, keeping in line with Hispanic constitutional practices, formed a government with a powerful legislature and weak executive branch.

In South America, the restoration of the Spanish constitution provided advocates of independence with the opportunity to press their campaign to liberate the continent: South American insurgents defeated the royal authorities in battle.

Two competing political traditions emerged, emphasizing strong executive power and the other insisting on the pre-eminence of the legislature - they epitomized a fundamental disagreement about the nature of government. New Spain, achieving independence through political compromise, is representative of the civil tradition. there, the Hispanic system evolved.

In contrast, military force liberated northern South America - the men of arms dominated men of law. The three newly independent South American nations established strong centralist governments with powerful chief executives and weak legislatures. The Southern Cone did not fall under the control of military men - there, warfare with royalist forces has been limited and most of the fighting that occurred among provinces that struggled for autonomy from their capital cities.

The fate of the new nations of America depended on timing.

British-American struggle for independence constituted a larger international conflict - gaining its independence as part of an international agreement of the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The US had neither to spend large sums of money for its defence. Spain's involvement in the French revolution and subsequent wars created a great commercial opportunity for the young republic because that monarchy had to rely on neutral shipping to conduct its trade.

The independence of the US did not result in the political and economic destruction - Great Britain became the preeminent industrial power in the world.

Haiti began its process of independence by continuing patterns and processes that had been evolving for years. At first, Saint Domingue participated in the transformation of the French Revolution but the slaves insisted on freedom and equality. The bloody wars to achieve those goals jeopardized the country's economic and political future. A revolution of former slaves terrified these white societies, so Europeans isolated the country, introducing a profitable tropical agriculture to other Caribbean islands.

The emancipation of Spanish America destroyed a vast and responsive social, political and economic system - the Spanish Monarchy, which once proved to be flexible and capable of accommodating social tension, functioned at a competitive disadvantage.

The Spanish people achieved independence after the European conflicts, resulting in Europe and United States flooding their country with their goods, resulting in lower prosperity.

Spain and Spanish America proves proof of the cost of independence: the two regions suffered political chaos, economic decline, economic imperialism and foreign intervention. There was no simple solution for nations whose economies had been destroyed by war.

Only in the last 1/3 of the nineteenth century did Spain and Spanish America consolidate their states, but the former Spanish Monarchy languished in comparison to the countries of Britain, France, Germany and the US. Thus, they must adopt a secondary role in the new world order.
