[[Realist Theory in International Relations]] - John J. Mearsheimer W. W. Norton & Company New York London

## 1 Introduction


Great powers are rarely content with the current distribution of power ... they face a constant incentive to change it in their favour ... they almost always have revisionist intentions.

At times, the costs and risks of trying to shift the balance of power are two great, forcing great powers to wait for more favourable circumstances.

This unrelenting pursuit of power means that great powers are inclined to look for opportunities to alter the distribution of world power in their favour - they will seize these opportunities if they have the necessary capability.

Why?
Three features:
1. The absence of a central authority that sits above states and protect them from one another
2. The fact that states always have some offensive military capability
3. The fact that states can never be certain about other state's intentions

This system is genuinely tragic - great powers have no reason to fight each other, they are merely concerned with their own survival, and have little choice but to pursue power and to dominate other states in the system.

### Offensive Realism

This theory focuses on the great powers because those states have the largest impact on what happens in international politics - the fortunes of all states are determined primarily by the decision of those with the greatest capabilities.

17

Great powers are determined largely on the basis of their relative military capability - to qualify as a great power, a state must have enough assets to put a serious fight in an all-out war against the most powerful state in the world.

The candidate does not have the capability to defeat the leading state but it must have enough prospect to turn that conflict into a war of attrition that leaves the dominant state weakened.

This book will focus on great-power relations from the start of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars in 1792 until the end of the twentieth century.

Then, we will make predictions.

## The Virtues and Limits of Theory

20

We cannot make sense of the complex world without theory - Clinton's foreign policy rhetoric, the claim that economically interdependent states are unlikely to fight one another, the claim that democracies won't fight one another, the claim that institutions enable states to avoid war and concentrate on building cooperative relationships.

Theories encounter anomalies because they simplify reality by emphasizing certain factors while ignoring others - offensive realism assumes that the international system strongly shapes the behaviour of states: structural factors such as anarchy and distribution of power explains international politics the best.

Offensive realism does not answer every question that arises, there will be cases in which the theory is consistent with several possible outcomes - for example why it can't account for why security competition in the cold war was more intense between 1945 and 1963 than between 1963 and 1990. It has little to say too if NATO should've adopted a strategy to deter the Warsaw Pact in central Europe.

### The Pursuit of Power

Liberalism versus Realism is important.
[[Theory of International Politics]] critique some aspect of liberalism - Watz challenges [[Hans Morgenthau]] 's claim that multipolar system are more stable than bipolar systems. Morgenthau argues that states strive to gain power because they have an innate desire, Walz maintains that the structure of IR forces states to pursue power.

### Liberalism

Liberalism's view of international politics is based on three beliefs: first that liberals consider states to be the main actor in international politics, second that they emphasize that the internal characteristics of states vary considerable and that internal arrangements like democracy are inherently preferable to others like dictatorship. Thusly, there are good and bad states.

25

Third, calculations of power matter very little - political and economical calculations matter more.

The three main theories found under liberalism:
1. The first argues that high levels of economic interdependence among states make them unlikely to fight each other
2. Democratic peace theory claims that democracies do not go to war against democracies
3. International institutions enhance the prospect for cooperation among states and significantly reduce the likelihood of war.

### Realism

On the other hand, they see no way to escape the harsh world of security and competition.

This is based on three core beliefs:

1. The states are the principal actors in world politics, focusing on great powers
2. The behaviour of great powers is influenced by their external environment and not their internal characteristics
3. Calculations about power dominate states' thinking and that states compete for power among themselves, sometimes necessitating going to war.

27

Human nature realism dominates the study of IR from the late 1940s, based on the assumption that states are led by human beings who have a will to power hardwired in at both - an insatiable appetite for power that means they constantly look for opportunities to take the offensive and dominate other states.

There's no basis for discriminating among aggressive or less aggressive states - international anarchy causes states to worry about the balance of power.

Structural realism came into the scene in the late 1970s with the appearance of Waltz's [[Theory of International Politics]], assuming that states don't have a will to power ... they just want to survive. They just seek security. Great powers need to pay attention to this otherwise they will fail, fall.

Anarchy encourages states to behave defensively and to maintain rather than upset that balance of power. He recognizes that states have incentives to gain power at their rivals' expense and that it makes good strategic sense, but he emphasizes that when great powers behave aggressively, potential victims balance against the aggressor.

For Waltz, balancing checkmates offense. Great powers must not acquire too much power otherwise excessive strength will cause states to join forces against them.

He says very little about the causes of war.

28

John's theory of offensive realism is also a structural theory of international politics - great powers are concerned mainly with figuring out how to survive in a world where they is no agency to protect them from each other, realizing that power is the key to their survival. For Offensive realists, they believe that status quo powers are rarely found in world politics because the international system creates powerful incentives for states to look for opportunities to gain power at the expense of rivals, taking advantage of those situations when the benefits outweigh the costs.

Offensive realists dispute human nature realism (like Morgenthau) that states are endowed with personalities - rather, they argue that the international system forces great powers to maximize their relative power as this is the optimal way to maximize their security. Survival mandates aggressive behaviour.

### Power Politics in Liberal America

Realism's central message - that it makes good sense for states to selfishly pursue power - does not have broad appeal ... most people think of wars as the fight between good and evil.

Americans have an antipathy towards balance-of-power thinking.

They tend to be hostile to realism because it clashes with their basic values whereas liberalism does. Americans are optimists - Realism depicts a world rife with security, competition and war. They also believe morality should play an important role in politics.

Liberal democracies with market economies are tended to be identified as 'the most worthy.'

31
### Rhetoric versus Practice

Americans dislike realpolitik so public discourse about foreign policy is couched in the language of liberalism - optimism and moralism.

It should be obvious that the United States speak one way and acts another. Policymakers have remarked this tendency in American foreign policy - states on the European continent regard the English-speaking peoples as "masters in the art of concealing their selfish national interests in the guise of the general good."

This goes unnoticed.

Why? Sometimes, realist policies sometimes coincide with the dictates of liberalism.
Second, power considerations force the US to act in ways that conflict with liberal principles - "spin doctors" appear and tell a story that accords with liberal ideals.

## 2 Anarchy and the Struggle for Power

Great powers ... are always searching for opportunities to gain power over their rivals with hegemony as their final goal. This perspective does not allow for status quo powers except for the unusual state - instead, the system is populated with great powers that have revisionist intentions at their core.

34
### Why states pursue power

This is derived from five assumptions:

#### Bedrock Assumption

The first assumption is that the international system is anarchic - it is an ordering principle that suggests the realist notion of anarchy is an ordering principle which suggests that the system comprises independent states that have no central authority above them.

The second assumption is that great powers possess some offensive military capability that allows them to hurt and destroy each other. States are dangerous and their military power is identified with weaponry at its disposal.

Third, states can never be certain about other states' intentions - no state can be sure that another state will not use its offensive military capability. This is not to say that states necessarily have hostile intentions.

The fourth is that survival is the primary goal of great powers - states seek to maintain their territorial integrity and autonomy of their domestic political order. Survival dominates other motives because, once a state is conquered, it is unlikely to be in a position to pursue other aims.

The fifth assumption that great powers are rational actors - they are aware of their external environment and they think strategically about how to survive in it. In particular, they consider the preferences of other states and how their own behaviour is likely to affect the behaviour of those other states and how the behaviour of those other states is likely.

None of these assumptions alone dictate that great powers as a general rule should behave aggressively - they just want to survive. The three general patterns of behaviour: fear, self-help and power maximisation.

### State Behaviour

Great powers fear each other - regard each other with suspicion, and they worry that war might be in the offing, they anticipate danger and there is little room for trust - for example, the reaction of UK and France to Germany reunification.

The basis of this fear is that in a world where great powers have the capability to attack. Any state bent on survival must be suspicious of other states and reluctant to trust them.

The possible consequences of falling victim further amplify the importance of fear as a motivating force in world politics - great powers do not compete with each other as though politics is an economic marketplace. Political competition among states is a dangerous business. It can lead to war, and the mass killings on the battlefield.

States aim to guarantee their survival, and can't depend on others for their own security. They are vulnerable and alone, and it aims to provide for its own survival.

37

States operating in a self-help world act according to their own self-interest and do not subordinate their interests to the interests of other states, or to the interests of the so-called international community - it pays to be selfish in a self-help world.

Apprehensive about the ultimate intentions of other states ... states understand that the best way to ensure their survival is to be the most powerful state in the system. The stronger a state is, the less likely that its rivals will fight it.

States pay close attention to how power is distributed among them, making a special effort to maximize their share of world power - they look for opportunities to alter the balance of power by acquiring additional increments of power at the expense of potential rivals, employing economic, diplomatic and military means.

Essentially, this is a zero-sum game.

Even when a great power achieves a distinct military advantage over its rivals, it continues looking for chances to gain more power - the pursuit of power stops only when hegemony is achieved. The idea that a great power might feel secure without dominating the system is not persuasive: it is difficult to assess how much relative power one state must have before it is secure. Second, determining how much power is enough is complicated when great powers contemplate how power will be distributed among them ten or twenty years down the road.

38

Therefore, we must achieve hegemony now since we don't know how much power is enough for today and tomorrow. States are always better off with more power than less.

All states are influenced by this logic - they work to ensure that states do not take advantage of them. After all, rival states are driven by the same logic. In short, they pay attention to defence and offence - they think about conquest and work to check aggressor states from gaining power at their expense.

The "security dilemma" is the logic of offensive realism - the measures a state takes to increase its own chances of survival decrease the security of other states. Thus, it is difficult for a state to increase its own chances of survival without threatening the survival of other states.

![[Pasted image 20231026170707.png]]

States that are more concerned over relative power behave differently than states interested in absolute power - state that maximize relative power are concerned with the distribution of material capabilities, trying to gain a power advantage, likely to forgo large gains in their own power, if such gains give rival states even greater power, for smaller national gains provide them with power.

States that maximize absolute power care about the size of their own gains, not concerned about the power of other states.

### Calculated Aggression

There is little room for status quo powers in a world where states are inclined to look for opportunities to gain more power. Great powers cannot act on their offensive intentions because behaviour is obviously influenced by capacity.

A great power with advantage will behave aggressively. In contrast, great powers facing powerful opponents may be more concerned with defending the existing balance of power from threats by their more powerful opponents. Let there be an opportunity for those weaker states to revise the balance in their own favour and they will take advantage of it.

Great powers are not aggressors. On the contrary, they think carefully about the balance of power and how other states will react to their moves - weighing the costs and risks of offense.

40

These great powers obviously don't have perfect information - adversaries can misrepresent themselves and conceal their true aims. Hitler - Czechoslovakia.

Great powers are unsure of how their own military forces will perform. They are also unsure of the resolve of opposing states.

Defensive realists argue that offense rarely succeeds and that aggressive great powers end up being punished - that threatened states balance against aggressors and crush them, or that there is an offence-defence balance that is tilted to defence, making conquest difficult. Great powers should therefore be content with existing balance of power. Security is abundant and should have benign intentions - if not, the problem is domestic politics.

### Hegemony's limits

Global hegemons - dominate the world. Regional hegemons - dominate distinct geographical areas.

It is impossible for a state to achieve global hegemony - we can't project power across the world's oceans onto the territory of a rival great power.

The best outcome a great power can hope for is to be a regional hegemon and possibly control another region that is nearby and accessible over land - like the US.

States that achieve regional hegemony seek to prevent great powers from duplicating their feat - regional hegemons do not want peers. Regional hegemons attempt to check aspiring hegemons in other regions because they fear that a rival great power will be too powerful, they'd rather two great powers located themselves together in other regions as their proximity will cause them to focus on one another.

If a potential hegemon emerges among them, the other great powers might be able to contain it by themselves, allowing the distant hegemon to remain on the sidelines.

In sum, the ideal situation for any great power is to be the only regional hegemon in the world - a status quo power, going to considerable lengths to preserve the existing distribution of power.

### Power and Fear

The great powers fear each other - level of fear varies from case to case.

Fear among great powers derive from the fact that they have offensive military capability that they can use against each other and the fact that one can never be certain that other states do not intend to use that power against oneself - because states operate in an anarchic system, there is no one to turn to if another attacks them.

This discussion of how power affects fear prompts the question - what is power, it is important to distinguish between potential and actual power. A state's potential power is based on the size of its population and the level of its wealth - these two assets are the main building blocks of military power. More wealth -> large population.

Power considerations affect the intensity of fear among the state in three ways: rival states that possess nuclear forces that can survive a nuclear attack and retaliate against it.

Second, when great power are separated by large bodies of water - the usually do not have much offensive capability against each other.

Third, the distribution of power among the states in the system affects level of fear - the issue is if power is distributed more or less evenly.

A potential hegemon is more than just the most powerful state in system - it is a great power with actual military capability and so much power that it stands a good chance of dominating and controlling all of the power.

Bipolarity is the power configuration that produces the least amount of fear among the great powers - fear tends to be less acute in bipolarity. Multipolar systems without a potential hegemons - balanced multipolarity.

Great power balance against states with formidable military forces - offensive military capability is the tangible threat to their survival.

### The hierarchy of state goals

Survival is the number of one goal of great powers - in practice, states pursue non-security goals as well.

Offensive realism certainly recognize that great powers might pursue these non-security goals but has nothing to say about them. The pursuit of these non-security goals sometimes complement the hunt for relative power.

But sometimes the pursuit of non-security goals conflict with the balance-of-power logic - states usually act according to the dictates of realism. 

Security also trumps wealth when these two goals conflict - Smith provides a good illustration of how states behave when forced to choose between wealth and relative power.

Example: navigation act.

### Creating World Order

The claim is sometimes made that great powers can transcend realist logic by working together to builds an international order that foster peace and justice - can enhance a state's properity and security.

This rhetoric notwithstanding, great powers do not work together - they maximize their own share of world power, that is likely to clash with the goal of creating and sustaining stable international order. They work hard to deter wars in which they would be the victim.

This order is a by-product of the self-interest behaviour of the system's self-interested behaviour of the system's great powers. The configuration is the unintended consequence of great-power security competition.

For sure, great-power rivalry will sometimes produce a stable international order as happened during the Cold War. Nevertheless, the great powers will continue looking for opportunities to increase their share of world power.

Great powers cannot commit themselves to a pursuit of world order:
1. States are unlikely to agree on a general formula for bolstering space
2. Great powers cannot put aside power considerations and work to promote international peace because they cannot be sure that their efforts will succeed.

### Cooperation among states

One might conclude from the preceding discussions that this does not allow any cooperation among the great powers. Despite that, there are two factors that inhibit cooperation: consideration about relative gains and concern about cheating. These two powers live in a competitive world where they view each other as enemies.

Any two states contemplating cooperation must consider cooperating with other states - each state tries to maximize its absolute gains. It is important for a state to make sure that it does no worse and perhaps better than the other state in any agreement. Cooperation is more difficult to achieve when states are attuned to relative gains rather than absolute gains - states concerned about absolute gains want some of the share.

Concerns about cheating (especially in the military realm) occupy a great part of this thought.

Cooperation takes place in a world that is competitive - one where states have powerful incentives to take advantage of other states.

### Conclusion

The structure of the international system causes states to think and act offensively, and to seek hegemony.

The principal motive behind power is survival.



## Wealth and Power

51

States have two kinds of power: latent power and military power, derived from different assets. Latent power refers to the socio-economic ingredients that go into building military power, based on a state's wealth and overall size of its population. Great powers need money and personnel to build military forces and to fight wars.

A state's effective power is a function of its military forces and how they compare with the military forces of rival states - power is defined in military terms as offensive realism emphasizes that force is the ultima ratio of international politics.

Military power is based on the size and strength of a states army - the core ingredient of a military power. Independent naval forces and strategic air forces are not suited to conquering territory or coercing other states into making concessions. Great-power wars are won on the ground.

States care a lot about latent power because wealth and large populations are required formidable military forces.

### The Material Basis of Power

Power can be defined in two ways: nothing more than specific assets or material resources that are available to a state. Others argue power is in terms of the outcome of interactions between states.

These definitions don't seem that meaningful: after all, wouldn't the side with the greater materials win?

The balance of power is not a reliable predictor of success - non material factors like strategy, intelligence, resolve, weather and disease matter.

What about strategy - how a state employs its forces against an opponent force? Look at the Schlieffen Plan or Russia's defeat of Napoleon army, or even the battle of Agincourt.

Sometimes, less powerful states can beat more powerful states. Therefore, weaker states are sometimes going to initiate wars against stronger states. The same logic applies to states of equal might.

Therefore it is not possible to equate the balance of tangible assets with outcomes because non-material factors such as strategy sometimes profoundly affect outcomes.

There are three reasons not to do this: first, when focusing on outcomes it becomes impossible to assess the balance of power before a conflict.
Second, this approach leads to implausible conclusions - Russia beat Napoleon, but Russia is not more powerful than France. Vietnam is not more powerful than the UUS.
Third, power, as a means, affects political outcomes, which are ends.
