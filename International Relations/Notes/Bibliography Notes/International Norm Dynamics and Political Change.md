First: the ideation "turn" of recent years is actually a return to some traditional concerns of the discipline, but it has not brought us back to precisely the same place we began. Standards for good empirical research have changed dramatically.

Second: we generate some propositions about three aspects of norms - their origins, the mechanisms by which they exercise influence and the conditions under which norms will be influential in world poltics. We argue that norms evolve in a patterned life cycle and that different behavioural logics dominate different segments of the life cycle.

Third, we argue that the tendency to oppose norms against rationality or rational choice is not helpful in explaining the politically salient processes we see in empirical research in which actors strategize rationally to reconfigure preferences. Rationality cannot be separated from any episode of normtive influence just as normative context conditions any episode of rational choice. Norms and rationality are thus intimately connected.

## The Return to Norms

Essentially, we have moved into rationalist assumptions of neo-realists and neo-liberals that we have forgotten.

What is a norm?
1. Constructivists talk in POLSCI of a 'language' of norms, sociologists talk a language of 'institutions'. The norm definition isolate single standards of behaviour whereas institutions emphasize the way in which behavioural rules are structured together and interrelate - it can however obscure elements of social institutions if not used carefully. Discussions of sovereignty or slavery are just collections of norms.
2. Constitutive norms create new actors, regulative norms order and constrain behaviour, we also have prescriptive norms that isn't covered much. Norms are unique as we know what is appropriate by reference to the judgements of a community or a society.
3. Norms as shared assessments raise the question of how many actors must share the assessment before we call it a norm - in part this is an empirical question, for instance how norms are regional. 

We argue that one way to understand this is through the "life cycle" of norms - agreement among a critical mass of actors on some emergent norms can create a tipping point after which agreement becomes widespread in many empirical cases and we can provide suggestions about common features of critical features of critical mass.

### Connecting Domestic and International Norms

Domestic norms are deeply entwined with the workings of international norms - many international but many international norms began as domestic norms and become international through the efforts of entrepreneurs of various kinds. International norms must work their influence through the filter of domestic structures and domestic norms.

Arguably, to make laws, we need an understanding of the pervasive influence of social norms of behaviour - a great insight for IR scholars since the international system is characterized by law and norms operating without direct punitive capacity - the processes through which these legal scholars claim that norms work domestically. 

### Stability Versus Change

Macro-level theorizing explains that norms produce social order and stability: Norms channel and regularize behaviour, limiting the range of choice and constraining actions. From a constructivist perspective, international structure is determined by the international distribution of ideas and this gives the world structure, order and stability. The problem for constructivists come thus: explaining change.

## Evolution and Influence of Norms

We will cover:
1. The origins or emergence of international norms
2. The processes through which norms influence state and  non-state behaviour
3. Which norms matter and under what conditions

This is traced through women's rights and laws of law.

### The Norm "Life Cycle" 896

Norm influence can be understood as a three-stage problem: the first is "norm emergence", the second involves broad norm acceptance, a "norm cascade" and the third involves internalization. The first two stages are divided by a threshold or tipping point.

The characteristic mechanism of the first stage is persuasion by norm entrepreneurs - they attempt to convince a mass of norm leaders (states) to embrace new norms. The second stage is characterized by a dynamic of imitation as the norm leaders attempt to socialize other states to become norm followers, and in general a combination of pressure for conformity, desire to enhance international legitimation and the desire of state leaders to enhance their self-esteem facilitate norm cascades. Then norm internalization occurs where norms acquire a taken-for-granted quality and are no longer a matter of public debate.

#### Stage 1: Origins or emergence of norms

The account of norms in most studies stress human agency, indeterminacy, chance occurrences, and favourable events, using process tracing as a method.

Norm entrepreneurs: norms are actively built by agents having strong notions about appropriate or desirable behaviour in their community.

The international campaign for women's suffrage was indebted to the leadership of such norm entrepreneurs as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony in the US and Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst in England. These are consistent with Ethan Nadelmann's description of 'transnational moral entrepreneurs' who engage in "moral proselytism".

Norm entrepreneurs are critical for norm emergence because they call attention to issues by using language that names, interprets and dramatizes them - referring to this reinterpretation as "framing". In constructing their frames, norm entrepreneurs face firmly embedded alternative norms and frames that create alternative perceptions of both appropriateness and interest. For women, norm entrepreneurs encountered alternative norms about women's interest and the appropriate role for women. New norms never encounter a normative vacuum but emerge in a highly contested normative space where they must compete with other norms.

Efforts to promote a new norm take place within existing standards of "appropriateness" and thus activists need to be explicitly "inappropriate" - Suffragettes chained themselves to fences, went on hunger strikes, broke windows, refused to pay taxes. They thus sought to send a message and frame an issue.

What does thus motivate norm entrepreneurs? It's hard to explain the motivations of their actors without reference to empathy, altruism and ideational commitment - empathy exists when actors have the capacity for participating in an other's feelings or ideas - such empathy might lead to empathetic interdependence. Altruism exists when actors take action to benefit another at risk of harm. Ideational commitment is the main motivation when entrepreneurs promote norms or ideas because they believe in the ideals and values embodied in the norms even though the pursuit of the norms have no effect on their well being.

Many entrepreneurs act in accordance with a redefined understanding of their interests. For them, women had to be persuaded that it was in their interests to pursue suffrage, but they worked on behalf of a conception of women's political interests.

### Organizational Platforms

All norm promoters need an organizational platform through which they promote their norms - NGOs, or the larger transnational advocacy networks of which these NGOs become a part. Take a look at the World Bank or the UN.

One prominent feature of modern organizations an important source of influence is their use of expertise and information to change the behaviour of other actors. Enterprise resides in professionals that helps or blocks the promotion of new norms within standing organization. Peter Hass's study of the clean-up of the Mediterranean shows how ecologists were successful in promoting their norms because they were able to persuade governments to create new agencies to deal with the clean-up. Studies of the World Bank documents a strong role for professional training in filtering the norms that the bank promotes. The inability to quantify many costs and benefits associated with antipoverty and basic human needs norms created resistance among the many economists staffing the bank because projects promoting these norms could not be justified on the basis of "good economics".

Norm entrepreneurs need to secure the support of state actors to endorse their norms and make norm socialisation a part of their agenda, and different organisational platforms provide different tools: the UN and the World Bank have leverage over weak or developing states they seek to convert to their normative convictions. Networks of NGOs are rarely able to "coerce" agreement to a norm - they must persuade, they must take what is seen as natural and convert it into something perceived as wrong or inappropriate.

For an emergent norm to reach a threshold and move to the second stage, it must be institutionalized in specific sets of international rules and organizations: such institutionalization contributes strongly to the possibility for a norm cascade both by clarifying what the norm is and what constitutes violation and spelling procedures by which disapproval is made.

Women's suffrage was not institutionalized in international rules or organizations prior to the beginning of the norm cascade. The first intergovernmental agency was the Inter-American Commission of Women established in 1928.

### Tipping or Threshold Points

We can say that there is a tipping point. The authors provide two hypotheses about what constitutes a critical mass and where to expect norm tipping. It is obviously not possible to predict exactly when norms change as states more states accept the norms as states are not equal. 1930 for Women - twenty states accepted suffrage.

It also matters which states adopt the norm: some states are critical to a norm's adoption and others are less so. Critical states are those without which the achievement of the substantive norm goal is compromised. In the case of South Korean land mines, the decision in mid-1997 by France and Great Britain, without their support, the norm was unlikely to go ahead. Also, states may be critical as they possess a certain moral stature.

### Norm Cascades

A different dynamic begins - more countries begin to adopt new norms without domestic pressure for such a change. Empirical studies suggest that often an international or regional demonstration or contagion occurs in which international and transnational norm influences become more important than domestic politics.

Contagion is a passive metaphor: the primary mechanism for promoting norm cascades is an active process of international socialization intended to induce norm breakers to become norm followers. [[Kenneth Waltz]] argues that socialization occurs: in emulation of heroes, praise for conformity and ridicule. In the context of IR, socialization involves diplomatic praise.

Socialization is the dominant mechanism of a norm cascade... but what makes it work? What are the motives that induce states opposed to the norm to adhere and adhere quickly? States thereof comply with norms for reasons that relate to their identity - recognition of state identity fundamentally shapes state behaviour and this is shaped by the cultural-institutional context within states act. One's identity is as a member of a particular social category and what happens therein is that all members follow certain norms.

States care about international legitimation because it has become an essential contributor to perceptions of domestic legitimacy held by a state's own citizens - domestic legitimacy is the belief that existing political institutions are better than other alternatives and therefore deserve obedience. Citizens make judgement about whether their government is better than alternatives by looking at those alternatives and seeing what other people say. Therefore, it reflects back on a government's domestic basis of legitimation and consent and ultimately its ability to stay in power.

Also, conformity and esteem matter. Social norms are sustained by these feelings, identity is based on the aspects of the self in which an individual has special pride from which an individual gains self esteem. In this sense, states care about following norms associated with liberalism because being liberal states is part of their identity.

Essentially, through conformity, people are encouraged to make follow. In situations where the objective reality is ambiguous, individuals are even more likely to turn to social reality to form and evaluate their beliefs. Here, state leaders conform to norms in order to avoid the disapproval aroused by norm violation and thus to enhance national esteem. It is difficult to generalize to the state level from research on esteem done at the individual level, but norm entrepreneurs target individual state leaders for criticisms - one way to think about them is that they provide the information and publicity that provoke cognitive dissonance.

### Internalisation

At the extreme of a norm cascade, norms may become so widely accepted that they are internalised by actors and become taken for granted.

For instance, professional training: it actively socializes people to value certain things above others. Doctors are trained to value life and soldiers are trained to sacrifice life. As state bureaucracies and international organizations have become more and more professionalized over the twentieth century, we should see policy reflect the normative biases of the professions that staff decision-making agencies.

Another mechanism - iterated behaviour and habit. This argument suggests that the routes to normative change may be indirect and evolutionary: procedural change that create new political processes can lead to gradual and inadvertent normative, ideational and political convergence.

### Which Norms Matter Under What Condition?

One criticism: it provides no hypotheses about what norms will be influential.

**Legitimation**: an important condition for domestic receptiveness is important. If states seek to enhance their reputation we would expect states that are insecure about their international status to embrace new international norms.

**Prominence**: some domestic norms appear more likely candidates for internationalization, due to the quality of the norm itself or the quality of the states promoting on that norm. One argument: norms held by states are viewed as successful and desirable are likely to be prominent, the fact that Western norms are more likely to diffuse internationally would seem to follow. This fits the pattern of women's suffrage norms. Another argument: prominence should be seen in cultural and economic and military terms, look at Greece and China that were conquered and whose norms were assimilated by their conquerors.

**Intrinsic characteristics of the norm**: we can divide these claims between those stressing the formulation of the norm (its clarity and specificity) and those stressing the substance of the norm and the issues it addresses (its content). Those of the latter argue that norms are clear and specific and those that have been around for awhile are more likely to be effective. Arguments about which substantive normative claims will be more influential varies.

*Skipped some*

Arguments that the substantive content of a norm determines whether it will be successful imply that norm evolution has a clear direction if not a final endpoint and suggests that proponents support some notion of historical efficiency. It moves these norms researchers out of the "history-dependent institutionalism" box. Not all researchers accept this - Research Price argues on chemical weapons that chemical weapons are not more terrible than other weapons yet they specifically are prohibited. Price's work on the prohibition of land mines suggest that transnational norm entrepreneurs have used images of bodily harm as a way of mobilizing against them.

## Norms, Rationality, and Strategic Social Construction 909

Nothing about rational choice requires an ontology - the utilities can be specified as social or ideational and these provide interesting insights into the normative patterns.

One problem is that claiming that norms are a cause of behaviour does not tell us much - there many reasons to conform to a norm and scholars disagree about the motivation. How adequate is a materialist philosophy?

Another debate - studying the behavioural logic of rational choice approaches like utility maximisation. Another approach - logic of appropriateness, actors internalise roles as scripts to which they conform because they understand it as good. Can this capture everything?

A third issue: is the role of choice and determinism. Actors in rational choice theory are forced to conform. What about norm internalized in actors - they are not choosing to conform to them in any meaningful way, they don't think about whether the state is more efficient, they just set up more states.

Yet, as we survey norm research: IR scholars applying logic of appropriateness have not been imperialistic, argument is that appropriateness is important to study. Also, within a logic of appropriateness there is substantial room for choice.

Finally - how do these norms treat persuasion? Persuasion is the process of which agent action becomes social structure, ideas become norms and subjective becomes intersubjective.

We can look at psychology for this - one structural argument and one logical argument. International legal scholars draw on a complex structure of rules to craft arguments about - the persuasiveness of a normative claim is tied to the fit of that claim in normative frameworks.

They talk about psychology.

Debates over these issues of materialism, utilitarianism, choice and persuasion shape this.

## Conclusion 

Essentially, we should study norms more.

Ideational phenomena have been treated as
