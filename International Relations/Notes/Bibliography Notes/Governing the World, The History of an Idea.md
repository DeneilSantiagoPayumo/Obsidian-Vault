# Part 1: The Era of Internationalism
## A collection of key ideas from the text
### Under the Sign of the International
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

28

The emergence of the idea that the rulers make up of a kind of international society is more recent and emerged out of dissatisfaction with medieval notions of universal order. It is from such beginnings that we can discern the origins of a European exceptionalism that made a virtue out of the slow political disintegration of Christendom and laid the foundation for modern internationalism.

What worried early modern political theorists could unite the rulers of different states:

The chief characteristic of international politics was and is anarchy - the absence of a single authority to compel members of the societies of nations to the sort of obedience they themselves expected from their subjects - see Thomas Hobbes, 16th and 17th law of nature on natural law, 18th the idea of a law of nations that could be deduced, eighteenth theorists of peace were advancing confederative schemes.

Critics charged advocates of balance-of-power politics with rationalizing the status quo and underplaying the need for change.

30

Kant clashed with the sovereign the Prussian king Friedrich Willhelm II. Then French Revolution broke out, shortly after, the Kingdom of Poland, largest state in Europe excised from the map of Europe. These events suggest that natural law theorists of the eighteenth century had been too complacent about that pacific nature of European civilization.

20th centuries: [[Immanuel Kant]] 's arguments were reframed by American political theorists arguing for activist foreign policy ... looked different from the Enlightenment original who had not written in praise of democracy.

Republics lead to peace since what mattered is the separation of powers (Kant).

Equally jarring to our contemporary sensibilities is Kant's extreme hostility toward international lawyers, an attitude explained by his belief that they basically acted as apologists for power and hence did nothing to advance the cause of peace. It hinders it by restraining violence.

"Kant thus argues that states bound by rules designed merely to avert war are no substitute for an eventual cosmopolitan world order, something he imagines emerging gradually and inevitably, as states federate and attract others to join them. He specifies no mechanism through which this could come about; we are not yet in an age comfortable with theorizing the problem of  **organization*. But it would certainly not be through commerce, as others believed it might, because Kant did not think that commerce civilized: he took a dim view of European traders and their impact on the rest of the world, and he criticized "the injustice which they show to lands and peoples they visit (which is equivalent to conquering them)." Basically, Kant believed that the movement toward "the world republic" would inevitably prosper and intenify principally because men everywhere are reasonable and will come over time to understand that it is in their interest. We thus find in his essay not the praise of a world of democratic peoples expressed by President Bush fils, nor the paean to free trade of devotees of globalization, but strong criticism of the European state system as it existed at the end of the eighteenth century combiend with what would become a powerfully influential outline of an evolutionary path for mankind to tread that equated the cause of peace with that of freedom and reason."
```

To Kant's faith, critics hated it - idea of European unity was better (Edmund Burke).

[[Jeremy Bentham]] - Bentham was not in favour of Burkean conversation or counter. Bentham sought for the primacy of matter and reason, reduction of philosophy and metaphysics to matters of sensation.

The sign of international thus existed in close but uneasy relationship to the phenomenon of widening political opinion. 

[[Felix Bodin]] - we should see internationalism in the context of a fast-changing society's ravenous appetite for ideas about the future in general.

The era of accelerated migration forged a culture increasingly attentive to the idea of the world as a unity, and created a public with vast and growing appetite for learning about transcontinental travel. It was at just this time that geography emerged, lavishly funded by the state, as a Janus-faced science indispensable for military conquests and intelligence, on the one hand, and given to visions of universal harmony.

... The rest is about international law.

### Brotherhood

#### The Peace Movement

In the first half of the nineteenth century, there were no more ardent internationalists to be found anywhere than among evangelical Christians - their abiding cause was peace.

(46) Appalled at the toll of intercontinental warfare and domestic repression, British dissenters and evangelicals started a Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace in 1816 that announced it was "principled against war, upon any pretence."

The American Peace Society was founded about the same time and beneath these national bodies an extraordinary network of small local peace societies. They are what [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] called 'association mania'.

It took time for these activists to organize international meetings - Anti-Slavery Convention that met in London in 1840. Three years later, the General Peace Convention had a significant American presence, an expression of the increasingly close ties linking American and British pacifists. The organizers declared that Anglo-American cooperation was mandated by God.

51

"The peace movement was running out of steam. The most exciting feature of their gathering at Frankfurt was the appearance of a Native American chieftain who had taken the name Reverend Copway; he presented a peace pipe to the delegates in the name of the "Great Spirit". Things improved ... The movement's star was already fading..."

#### Free Trade

The Crimean War showed that the spirit of war had not been abolished - it tore apart the European Concert by pitting Russia against France and Britain and prompting a heavy war fervour.

(53) "Free trade might strike us now as an argument for self-interest - a battering ram for whichever states enjoy competitive advantage internationally to open up foreign markets ... It has always stood for much more noble ideals  ... Its supporters regard tariffs as a step towards isolation and belligerence, open economies as the prerequisite for both prosperity and global harmony."

"The architects of repression saw their task as interconnected and came where necessary to one another's aid - this is how the concert of Europe was supposed to function ... They naturally connected the cause of domestic constitutionals reform with a larger assault on Europe's governing class and its assumptions."

"Cobden's free trade movement was the leading and unquestionably most successful version of radical internationalism to emerge in the first half of the nineteenth century. But this success was a mixed blessing. It was the fate of radical visions of international harmony when they failed (as the peace movement did) to be forgotten." (57)

"It is no coincidence that the distinctive ethos of internationalism emerged at this time. Bilateral commercial treaties seemed to offer a new model for regulating affairs among states, more practical, more democratic, and less hidebound than the Concert model of Great Power consultation." (58)

"It was at lines above suggest, in the awakening of the "public mind" that the free traders believed lay the best means to ensure the triumph of their creed. Their basic assumption, which they shared with evangelical thought, was that humanity's fraternal impulses would make themselves felt through the democratic power of opinion. The implication, so powerfully transmitted to several generations of liberals and thence to the architects of the League of Nations, was that humanity is peace-loving when left alone by governments. It is politicians who entangle men in wars, and special interests that corrupt man's innate selfishness; allow the free association of men and ideas and one constructs a force for peace. Free trade was thus an ideology of internationalism that required no special international organization beyond machinery to reduce tariffs..." (59-60)

The Crimean War brought Cobden and many of his followers face to face with "war spirit" that was pushing politicians to war. It came as a severe shock that the press and the public opinion they had been accustomed to appealing could turn to aggression so easily." 

#### Nationality as Internationalism

The third novel element of mid-Victorian internationalism was the principle of nationality - harmony and world peace are contradictory impulses, but this is a recent assumption and attitudes toward nationalism have changed enormously since its emergence as political force in continental Europe.

63

[[Ghiuseppe Mazzini]] turns out to be a rare feel: his vision of a world that is at peace because it has been transformed into an international society of democratic nation-state proved long after his death to be enormously influential. It was, as Woodrow Wilson appreciated, this idea of an association of national states that won out over ideas of unitary world government in the making of the League of Nations, and later the UN.

Mazzini's original enemies were the Habsburgs and behind them the Holy Alliance. It was their tyranny that led to his being imprisoned for membership in the secret revolutionary society, the Carbonari, before going into exile. The result was an antimonarchist credo.

"Nationalism was for him above all about the spiritual elevation achieved through mutual aid and collective action, and as such it rose above individual self-interest. Just as the family as a unit existed above the interests of any one of its members, so did the Nation - and beyond the Nation, Europe itself, embracing all its constituent people." 

66

"The Mazzinian national Program stressed self-help, mutual aid, and the acquisition of learning - Mazzini himself supported a school for the children of poor Italian workers in central London. But his doctrine had no place for class struggle or anything that threatened to undermine the holy grail of national unity."

"In their arguments, Marx and Mazzini, so important for understanding international affairs right through the Cold War, begins here in the vigorous intellectual jousting of Victorian radical politics. In their arguments, one sees the outlines of two visions of internationalism, the one based on the principle of national emancipation within a capitalist system, the other on communist internationalism: each would find superpower backing in the twentieth century." (67).

Communism: "internationalism" was more or less synonymous with organized socialism and above all with the rise of the Soviet Union to world power.

"Free trade - then in its heyday - was one of these, and at Brussels and afterward Marx sought to turn the internationalist logic of classical political economy against itself: capitalism in spreading over the globe would in fact prepare the terrain for the eventual worldwide triumph of the working classes ... The forces of jingoism and adventurism abroad were far stronger than Cobden had anticipated, and the impact of public opinion, upon which he had placed such faith, far less certain. " (69)

The struggle of ideas between Mazzini and Marx is important because the principles they stood for - nationality on the one hand, and communist internationalism on the other - shaped the rivalry that began in 1917 between Woodrow Wilson and Lenin for leadership of a postimperial world. (74)

(77) "Marx turned into Marxism, a rich but malleable body of thought interpreted by powerful social democratic parties such as the German and the Austrian as a means to analyse contemporary capitalism rather than a guide to revolutionary action."

"In fact, all three of the major strands of radical internationalism of the mid-nineteenth century followed a similar trajectory: great initial optimism was followed after some public success by challenges they were unable to surmount and then stalemate if not stagnation. What had sustained and galvanised all three was antipathy toward the restorationist program of the Concert of Europe, and the belief that there must be a better way to manage the continent's affairs, and the beliefs that there must be a better way to manage the continent's affairs, one that heeded the expansion of political consciousness and the global interconnectedness produced by trade and communications. But all three shared a common failing, a tendency to assume away the political obstacles they would face, an excessive confidence that the forces of change were moving in their direction. They all underestimated the political challenges posed by the power of the modern state, the tenacity of diplomacy, and the belligerence of nationalism. Free trade and the peace movement were shocked by the militarism of public opinion and the return to protectionism at the end of the century; Mazzini assumed that nationalists would share his belief in the common cause of humanity, but Bismarck or Cavour had little time for such sentiment. Marx and his followers regarded the ballot box as a distraction, and class solidarity as more powerful than ethnic or national loyalty, yet Europe's workers wanted the vote and went off to fight." (77)

### The Empire of Law

As nationalism consolidated itself in Europe and states gained internally in power rather than withering away, there emerged a new vein of internationalist thought and action, more practical and less revolutionary.

78

The 1851 Universal Peace Congress in London had called on "all the friends of Peace to prepare public ... With a view to the formation of an authoritarian Code of International Law." Unlike pacifism itself, this appeal to law continued to resonate strongly. Over the following decades a new transnational elite emerged that shared the pacifists' view that the salvation of the world depended on transforming the conservative order created at the Congress of Vienna and challenging the authority of diplomats.

For their past, those diplomats entrusted with the foreign policy of Europe's Great Powers realized that international law could actually in some circumstances make their work easier and more palatable to public opinion.

#### The men of 1873 and the rules of war

President Abraham Lincoln asked a German-American professor of politics at Columbia University.

"He was in contract with European jurists exploring the idea of codifying international law as a means of encouraging better relations among nations. His faith in the power of internationalism grew as a result." 

80

The year of the Lieber Code (1863) saw another effort to humanize war that was a first step toward the internationalization of the laws of war: the founding of the Red Cross in Geneva ... 

(80-81)

The first Geneva Convention was important for two reasons:
1. It took places entirely outside the Concert system - bringing together a number of small states and leaving outside several major powers that only joined later
2. It signalled a turn away from the older peace movement's effort to stamp out war entirely and toward the legal challenge of humanising the way it was conducted.

Then came the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 which shocked Europe with its summary executions, mass reprisals, and bloody denouncement in the rubble of Paris.

"What it preached was the need to move beyond the dominance of diplomacy. Everyone is a statesman of a sort, Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns had declared that international affairs  were too important to be left the diplomats alone. The point was that law was made not by kings nor even by parliaments but by deeper trends in society: the lawyer's task was to interpret and speak for these." (81).

#### The standards of Civilisation

Late Victorian international lawyers rooted their discipline in regnant ideological assumptions of the age.  Preeminent among these was the belief in the superiority of European civilization.

"Granted the existence of vary different cultures and societies around the world, what the lawyers did was to show how the idea of a standard of civilization could provide could provide a criterion for determining global rank and appropriate diplomatic practice." (83)

"Another of the founding members of the Institute of International Law, Edinburgh professor James Lorimer, taught that to the three levels of civilized society there were three corresponding kinds of state recognition - what we called plenary political, partial political, and finally natural, or merely human. That savages did not deserve full international recognition met with near universal agreement, but other lawyers disputed whether barbaric states like the Ottomans or the Chinese might be allowed a foot in the door." (84)

(84-85)
The potentially horrible consequences of these legal formations emerged at the Berlin colonial conference of 1884-85. This was basically an attempt to manage European rivalries in Africa, but it was filled with talk of the civilizing mission as a rationale for legitimating control over Africans. The concluding act talked of the need to "initiate the indigenous populations into the advantages of civilization," and the lawyers discussed new constitutional arrangement such as protectorates "in which  the touch of civilization is cautiously applied to matters barbaric ... the lawyers thus created a new language for European states to use to assess each other's claim to colonial territory." (84).

86 - "In an era of accelerated colonialism, therefore, lawyers were helpful, arguing that it was obviously "in the interest of the world's civilization that law and order and the true liberty consistent therewith shall reign everywhere upon the globe." 

"But nineteenth-century international law was double-faced; at the same time that lawyers justified the extension of colonial rule overseas, they defended its value for the emergent society of sovereign national states in Europe..." (86-87)

"The bifurcating impact of this new approach - humanizing relations between civilized states while simultaneously removing many of the impediments and inhibitions that older generation of legal theorists had built up to preserve civility in relations with less powerful peoples outside Europe - was nowhere evident than in the lawyers' proudest achievement - the Hague conferences' codification of the law of wars ... the legal doctrine of military occupation itself was intended to regulate a provisional state of affairs in which one sovereign's forces ran the territory of another without prejudicing the latter's claims to ultimate control." (87)  

"The 1899 discussions did produce some notable results in the realm of warfare. They outlawed bombing from the air, chemical weapons, and hollow bullets, and they succeeded in confirming that military occupation was a temporary, provisional state of affairs among two sovereign state." (88).

"Legal theory thus translated into the massacres, aerial bombings, and systematic detention that characterized European imperialism and that pointed to the extreme brutality of conflicts deemed to be beyond law's sway. Even before Belgian rule in the Congo became a byword for savagery, a critical book by the young Winston Churchill had revealed how an Anglo-Egyptian force equipped with modern rifles and artillery under a Sir Herbert Kitchen had killed ten thousand members of the Mahdi army in the Sudan for the loss of forty-eight of their own soldiers at the battle of Omdurman. The Hague Conventions did little to change this; if anything, they now allowed the case for brutality to be presented in a legalistic guise. ... Dropping bombs..." (90)

"Creating a sharp dichotomy between civilized and the barbarian thus had disturbing implications; but the Hague rules themselves were not the solution to all problems either, not least because they left so much to the interpretation of individual parties." (92-93).

"It is thus not surprisingly that by the turn of the century international lawyers had come to seem to radical critics - as they had earlier for Immanuel Kant - as much part of the problem as the solution ... It was rather that law itself looked like a rationalization of plunder, a world made free for the mighty to rob while claiming that justice was on their side." (92-93)

#### Cremer's Cause

"The follow-up to the 1899 Hague peace conference took place in 1907. More countries took part and there was a much greater participation of nations from outside Europe, especially from the Americas." (93)

"Marking the first significant influence of private philanthropic wealth on the emergent institution of the new internationalism, the palace testified in the most concrete terms to how much had changed in the world of diplomacy since Metternich's day. The United States itself was a new presence at the highest levels of international diplomacy, and the palace symbolized this." (94).

Arbitration is **a procedure in which a dispute is submitted, by agreement of the parties, to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision on the dispute**.
```


Roots, however, like other leading lawyers did not believe leading international lawyers did not believe that arbitration itself was enough. In Europe, several of them called for the creation of an international court and in the United States, they sought to do precisely what Westlake warned against - moving beyond arbitration into "international judicature." Not only was the Permanent Court set up at The Hague a very weak and still marginal institutional court and the in the United States, they sought to do precisely what Westlake warned against - moving beyond arbitration into "international judicature." (103)

"Thus early in the new century the legal professionals began to emphasize their differences with the arbitrations. Growing out of the American arbitration movement, and moving away from it, leading U.S. international lawyers banded together in 1905 to form a new American Society of International Law that was directed "exclusively to the interests of international law as distinct from international arbitration." (103)

### Science the Unifier
#### Science N/A

### The League of Nations

The internationalist alternatives to traditional diplomacy set transparency above secrecy, and participation above exclusion. Internationalists believed in cooperation among nations driven by scientific and commercial progress, and they regarded militarism and alliance diplomacy as irrational and retrograde.

There were limits however - the buy-in of major powers was still very limited. A negative answer would be that some of the principals promoters of the ideas of a Concert of Europe in 1815 no longer existed or mattered in 1918. The Hapsburg empire - in some ways the Concert's animating force - collapsed; Germany was defeated and prostrate.

#### The ambiguities of Woodrow Wilson

(129) It would not have been surprising if nineteenth-century America had simply kept aloof from Europe's internationalist initiatives. 

"Woodrow Wilson's foreign policy grew out of this pre-existing commitment to novel forms of mediation and peace-making even as it departed sharply from its guiding legalist principles." (129)

"There were obvious problems with both these proposals. Roosevelt's was limited to a small number of states and exempted matters of "vital interest" and "national honour" from law's verdict." (130)

135:

Wilson was quickly followed by British prime minister Lloyd George, who spoke out against annexation and emphatically in favour national self-determination. This term, which was to become so associated with Wilson, had in fact been highlighted far more emphatically by Lenin, heir to a long tradition of rich Marxist debate on nationality

Secretariat members themselves had believed from the outset that it was important to be totally impartial: true internationalism meant the impartial gathering of facts, not bowing to the whims of political masters. They prided themselves on their ability to stand above national interests and valued their role in embodying and fostering that all-important guarantor of future peace—the “International Mind.” But there was of course a certain self-deception in all this. For all that they were couched as manifestations of technical administrative virtuosity, their numerous initiatives did not take place in some ideologically neutral zone. The League’s currency stabilization packages were basically written, as a British Foreign office official put it, in order to keep places like Austria and Hungary “from throwing up their hands and going Bolshy.” The same anxiety lay behind its work resettling hundreds of thousands of refugees in Greece throughout the 1920s. Whether building new villages, or setting up independent central banks, the League’s technical operations intervened heavily in member states’ internal affairs as the price for assistance. As for the League’s approach to health and sanitary regulation, this was staunchly paternalistic. Thomas’s ILO had one of the most ideologically charged mandates of all in looking after workers’ rights, and steered a precarious corporatist course between hostile capitalists to its right and revolutionary socialists to its left.

Coordination, they were surprisingly young—Salter was thirty-nine when he was appointed, Monnet only thirty-one. As a result, their internationalist careers were not ended by the Second World War, but continued thereafter and cemented the continuities with the UN: Salter would help run UN Relief in postwar Europe; Monnet’s friend, the Polish Ludwik Rajchman, set up UNICEF; Monnet himself of course was to become heavily involved in European integration. Overall, more than two hundred employees of the League Secretariat entered the service of the UN, and three of the closest aides of Drummond, Avenol, and Sean Lester went on to serve their successors in New York.

From this perspective, it is not the League’s failures that we should focus on, but its enduring influence. A vehicle for world leadership based on moral principles and the formal equality of sovereign states, it preached the beginning of a new internationalist dispensation, repudiated the legacy of the Holy Alliance and the Concert of Europe, and offered the promise of democratization and social transformation through technical expertise. In fact, the League was the first body to marry the democratic idea of a society of nations with the reality of Great Power hegemony. This could be seen, for instance, in its decisive rejection of the possibility of a robust international law regime—something the UN would take even further—a rejection explained by the preference of its founders to preserve the political discretion of its members. It can be seen too in its deeply ambiguous attitude toward sovereignty and empire, embodied above all in the mandates system. Flexible and multivalent, this was a model of international government that would not only survive the Second World War but be greatly expanded and refined thereafter.

### The Battle of Ideologies

```ad-quote
title: 160-161!
**THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS embodied a paradox: it spoke the language of the brotherhood of man but existed as the result of a military victory. Like the older Concert of Europe, which it defined itself against, it was the instrument of a triumphant alliance of Great Powers and a means to preserve their domination of Europe—and their values—into the peace. But it was not alone**. In the spring of 1919, as the League was born in Paris, the Communist International was established by the Bolsheviks, and the old conflict between Mazzini and Marx reemerged on the world stage. The two bodies basically existed as rivals, but in 1934 when the USSR entered the League, they were pushed uneasily together in the face of a common threat from the most radically anti-internationalist of all the Great Powers, the Third Reich. Vehemently opposed to both the League and Bolshevism, the Nazis were extreme nationalists. Yet even they were obliged, once Europe lay at their feet in 1940, to articulate their own vision of international order, almost against their will. A third internationalism—the fascist variant—was thus born, and it is in this ideologically charged context of competing visions of world order that we need to set the League’s own understanding of the relationships between empire and nation, territory and sovereignty.

When Woodrow Wilson passed triumphantly through Italy in January 1919, vast crowds gathered for a glimpse of him en route to the peace conference gathering in Paris. It was the first time a serving U.S. president had visited Europe. In the city of Genoa, he made two acts of homage. The more predictable of these was to the house where Christopher Columbus had been born. But as we have already seen, he also laid a wreath before a monument to the city’s other great native son, Giuseppe Mazzini, and spoke of his debt to the Italian radical:

On the other side of the water we have studied the life of Mazzini with almost as much pride as if we shared in the glory of his history, and I am very glad to acknowledge that his spirit has been handed down to us of a later generation on both sides of the water. … It is with a spirit of veneration, Sir, and with a spirit I hope of emulation, that I stand in the presence of this monument and bring my greetings and the greetings of America with our homage to the great Mazzini.

Like most educated Americans, Wilson was steeped in the political theory of Europe. **Almost a century earlier, Mazzini had argued that the spread of the nationality principle would bring peoples together.** **Woodrow Wilson saw things the same way and welcomed the establishment of new democratic nations and built the League of Nations around them. Yet like Mazzini, Wilson took no account of ethnic complexity at all, and like Mazzini he had only the haziest notion of how to apply the nationality principle to ethnographically complicated places like eastern Europe.** Only belatedly did it hit him that what the principle of national self-determination did, as nineteenth-century critics like Lord Acton had pointed out long before, was to open a Pandora’s box of competing claims and turn minorities into a political problem.

Here, as in other areas,** the League emanated the breathtaking a civilizational self-assurance of nineteenth-century liberalism and hierarchical world it took for granted**. To British, American, and French delegates it was obvious that the maturity of their political institutions and the wisdom of their governing elites obviated the need for any such measures.

**First was substantive: rights for whom and which ones?**  ... in other words, not all members of an ethnic minority were equally worthy recipients of cultural and national rights - to use one's language in public as well as private, perhaps to ensure that it was taught in school and allowed to be used in the rpess, and by extension ot have a range of cultural activities safeguarded.

**The second issue was procedural: what status should such rights have, and who could grant them and provide the guarantee that they would be respected, without they would be meaningless?** ... these granted international recognition to these states and their borders and in return guaranteed their inhabitants not only equality before the law and freedom of worship but the right of use their own language and to private and public education.

For National Socialism, there were several things fundamentally wrong with the League. One was its **mystification** and **idealization** of international law, as if this existed in an abstract realm independent of the power relations it reflected. In reality, all the League had done, Germans argued, was to freeze a moment in which **liberalism**, in the shape of Britain, France, and the United States, was temporarily dominant, and then rewrite the rules in its image. But behind all the talk of a new organization in which all states were equal, in reality some remained more equal than others. The major powers had permanent seats on the council, for instance, and they did not have to worry about being bound by things like minority rights treaties. **Real power lay, as legal theorist Carl Schmitt put it, in the power to set the norms and to decide when they applied and to whom. The League was just another alliance, therefore, and as other states with different philosophies gathered strength, states like Fascist Italy and the Third Reich, the waning of the League’s power would be reflected in the fact that people ceased to take any notice of its rules.**

International law itself was to become, they **hoped, much less central in the conduct of interstate relations. The League had led to a “juridification” of international life because it had attempted to craft perennial rules for state behavior and to freeze the territorial status quo established at Versailles.** In the Nazis’ organicist vision of world politics as a constant struggle for life this was implausible. States could not be expected to refrain from seizing opportunities to expand through conquest any more than a plant could stop growing; they could not be expected to do what lawyers said—the ideal of the arbitration movement and the new Permanent Court of since there was no “common measure of justice”; rather, law should be expected, as in the Third Reich, to flow from the will of the people as expressed in the policies of their rulers

In particular it led commentators in the UK and America to wonder out loud what the future held for international law. “What’s wrong with International Law?” asked one émigré law professor in 1941. It was not that the Nazis were thought to be right in their arguments but **rather that their rise to power had thrown into question many of the most cherished axioms of interwar internationalism, above all the desirability of trying to regulate interstate relations through law**. Quincy Wright, a leading American supporter of the League, noted with dismay that “totalitarianism has unmasked the inadequacy of the philosophical and political foundations of international law.” Law as an unquestioned fount of impartial authority lay in tatters. **For some, the lesson was to establish an international authority stronger than the League had been with the power to make and enforce its own laws. But others wondered whether there existed the necessary shared values among states to make this possible, or whether very divergent social conditions and ideologies would preclude it.** The old shared confidence in the nineteenth-century standard of civilization was thus mortally wounded by the rise of Nazism itself. **If there was not a single European society, could there be a common standard of binding law? It was in this very precise sense that the war marked “the end of the European era.**
