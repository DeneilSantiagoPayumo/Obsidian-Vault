## CHAPTER ONE. The problem of Order

This book argues that the basic problem of order formation is a problem of coping with the newly emerged asymmetries of power. (17)

[[Max Weber]] took this as the central dilemma of politics - turning power into authority. In states of war, hegemonic states can aggrandize their position and states can seek security in balances of power, or create institutionalized political orders.

The settlements after 1815, 1919, and 1945 resorted to institutional strategies to establish strategic restraint and overcome fears of domination and abandonment - the focus of this book is to understand the logic and variation in these post war strategies.

The argument advanced here is that the character of post-war order has changed as the capacities of states to restrain power and establish commitments has changed. Democratic states and new institutional strategies allowed states to develop new responses to problems of order.

Chapters 4, 5 and 6 examine modern post-war cases.

The 1815 junction provided Britain with a leading power position but the establishment of binding institutions was limited by the nondemocratic character of the states involved, failing because of the inability to the states involved to make commitments. See the Russian Tsar Alexander's foreign policy. States used institutions as a a coercive force which had limitations

In 1919, the amount of democracies provided opportunities for institutional agreement, and states tried to draw the US into a security commitment. An institutional bargain was within reach, but Wilson's stubborn convictions about the sources of law and institutions, poor exercise of American power and missed opportunities doomed the settlement.

## CHAPTER 4. The Settlement of 1815

The peace settlement that ended the Napoleonic wars in 1815 gave Europe the most elaborately organized political order yet. Led by Great Britain, European states mounted a sustained effort to find a mutually agreeable, comprehensive and stable order, resulting in the celebrated Congress of Vienna.

This departed in that the leading state used institutions to manage relations among the great powers. "Great Britain pursued an institutional strategy aimed at establishing formal processes of consultation and accommodation among the post-war great powers" (81), binding rival states. The congress system in 1818 was inaugurated with the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, a conference to hold peace.

There were limits: the British proposal for security guarantees failed and the institutional arrangements were dramatically of less breadth and depth than those that were proposed or employed.

```ad-quote
"The asymmetries of power did provide dilemmas and opportunities that shaped the way the major states negotiated the terms of post-war order. Moreover, Britain and the other major powers did pursue a strategy of mutual restraint, loosely tying each to the other in treaty and alliance so as to mitigate strategic rivalry and the return to great-power war. The post-war alliance exhibited characteristics of a *pactum de controhendo*, a pact of restraint. These mutually entangling alliance relations supplemented and to some extend replaced balance of power as the core logic of order among the great powers of the European state system." (81-82)
```

What determined the extent of the model's success:
- It identified limits and impulses on uses of institutions: Britain used its power advantages to lock in a favourable order, and was willing to forego some advantages to exploit its position. 
- Additionally, the disparities of post-war and the character of the states involved were critical in determining the limits to which a bargain was possible. British power advantages were evident through its military forces and financial resources and used this leverage to maintain the alliance.
- The autocratic character of the states involved in the settlement placed limits on how far institutional strategies could be used - the proposal for a security guarantee suggested by PM William Pitt in 1805 foundered precisely on the inability of European leaders to make compromises

The model is helpful in identifying factors that are and are not present.
The model is not helpful in identifying the intellectual breakthrough that led Britain to seize on institutional mechanisms as a tool of order building - in appreciation of the potential role of ongoing consultative mechanisms as institutional devices to maintain order, expanding the order-building options of Britain and Euro states. 

The political order that emerged from the Vienna settlement combined old European logic of balance with new legal-institutional arrangements, its biggest departure was trying to cope with the problems of menacing states and strategic rivalry by tying states together through treaty.

Britain's use of institutional strategies are explicable in the institutional order-building model. Movement towards an institutional settlement is a response to an incentive that emerges - a newly powerful state has incentives to seek agreements on rules.

## CHAPTER 5. The Settlement of 1919

The peace of 1919, of the Versailles settlement, has been a source of debates.

It is striking in several respects:
1. It involved the most explicit and public discussion of the principles and organizations of postwar orders
2. Postwar leaders clashed over competing designs for order, differences being around the basic logic
3. Public and political parties were engaged in inspiring or constraining war aims, shaping and limiting the ability of leaders to pursue postwar order building goals.

The US envisioned the League of Nations, power balancing replaced by legal and rule-based mechanisms.

This model is useful in identifying the logic of America's institutional strategy:
1. The US did try to use its power advantages during and after the war to secure a postwar settlement, using offers of restraints on its own power to get constitutional advantages
2. The disparities of postwar power and the democratic character were important variables that shaped the incentives and limits on the institutional settlement - asymmetries favoured the US, providing it with resources and opportunities to lock in an institutional agreement

This model cannot account for the failure of the government to ratify some version of the peace agreement - the disparities of power worked in favour of an institutional bargain. It was Wilson's convictions about the democratic revolution and sources of commitments that doomed treaty ratification.

The constitutional model identifies incentives that informed American order building - the US pursued an institutional order building, responded to incentives. This was at the heart of Wilson's liberal program.

The asymmetries of power led Britain and France to worry about American domination and made a security tie.

Why did it fail? Reasons can be identified inside and outside the model. (161)

- "A focus on stubborn and divergent great-power interests is perhaps sufficient to explain the outcome. France certainly wanted a more traditional and binding security guarantee than the United States was unwilling or unable to provide."
- "The pre-eminence of American power did not translate into usable leverage in the waning moments of the war or in Paris during the negotiations."
- Wilson himself sucked - he had problems with the spirit of America's commitment to Europe, seeing the reservation as undercutting the political underpinnings of commitment which he saw to be legally binding.
