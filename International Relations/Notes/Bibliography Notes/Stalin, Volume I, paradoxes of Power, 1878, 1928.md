[[The Soviet Challenge to Pax Anglo-America]]

## SOVIET GEOPOLITICS

Twenty countries - including almost all the major powers - did not see a close, reliable partner in the Communist dictatorship.

Foreign embassies on Soviet soil were treated as Trojan horses of imperialism ... Soviet embassies abroad were headquarters for instigating communist coups.

Key to Socialism - not in 'imagined nose-thumbing', but the existence of two-imperialist blocs, the Anglo-French and the Austro-German, whose all-out clash distracted them from seeing the revolution in Russia and the war's spurring of strong movements of workers in imperialist countries.

Stalin recognised that world revolution was a tool to pursue a special global mission to break out of its enclosed geopolitical space (expanding at the expense of weaker neighbours, logical completion of an advance) - ultimate 'defensive' expansionism.

The 'limitrophe' - small states nothing more than playthings in the designs of world imperialism.

## BRUSHING OFF EUROPEAN RAPPROACHMENT

Stalin enticed by a vision of an opportunistic windfall from an intracapitalist war - to seek a German orientation or an Anglo-French one.

Stalin saw Britain as the pillar of imperialism. The Franco-Russian alliance waned due to the resurrection of a Polish state to contain Berlin.

Two opposing blocs had offered Russia a choice. Stalin despised demands of capitalist power but swallowed Comintern propaganda in the British empire, leading to diplomatic recognition in February 1924.

Berlin - consensus that Germany needed Britain for its Versailles revisionism against France. Germany declined the Soviet offer - Chicherin proposed a bilateral Soviet-German alliance.

German-Soviet dalliance resembled a marriage of convenience - each partner cheated on the others. Success capital achieved are transient but the process of capitalism's recovery contains weakness.

Moscow achieved commercial relations with Berlin but Comintern cast a low shadow - Eastern school of German diplomacy, pro-Western elements in Germany.

Hidden dimension to ties - clandestine military cooperation under Lenin. Versailles had restrictions on military, weapons production but Soviets offered Germany to violate these restrictions. German manufacturers were able to build submarines.

Britain wanted to integrate Germany politically and economically to remove the basis for war.

The Locarno Peace Pact (1925)- seven agreements negotiated at a resort between Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and Germany as well as Poland and Czechoslovakia. Germany recognized its borders in the west, ceding Alsace-Lorraine to France and agreeing to vague arbitration over its borders to the east, allowing for future revision.

Locarno's implications - two capitalist blocs making agreements, upend Stalin's theory of a pending Soviet windfall. Refused to accept the notion of an enduring capitalist stabilization - wanted to see a fratricidal war between imperialist blocs, USSR as beneficiary and outbreaks as consequence.

Believing otherwise implied Soviet concessions to capitalist powers on core principle.
