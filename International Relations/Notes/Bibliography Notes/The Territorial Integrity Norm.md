# The Territorial Integrity Norm: international Boundaries and the Use of Force
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
In this article I trace the dramatic change in attitudes and practices of states in the Westphalian international order concerning the use of force to alter interstate boundaries. I also explore the factors that have shaped this historical change. Of course, the Western state system did not expand to most of Asia and Africa until the twentieth century, and even the Latin American states were marginal to the system in the nineteenth century. In the first section I briefly outline the attitudes and practices of states regarding territorial boundaries from the seventeenth century until World War II. In the second section I focus on the remarkable changes in beliefs and practices from World War II until the present. In the third section I explore the roots of the territorial integrity norm. States' motivations for accepting the territorial integrity norm have been both instrumental and ideational, and the importance of different motivations has varied among groups of states. Also, the coincidence of a number of conditions has been crucial for the growing strength of the norm.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### International Boundaries from the Seventeenth to the Early Twentieth Century

"Initially, [in Westphalia] the legitimacy of interstate borders was defined in dynastic terms: state territory was the exclusive property of ruling families, and they had an absolute right to rule their territories ... this international order did not reflect any absolute right to *particular* territory that could *legitimately* change hands by inheritance, marriage, war, compensation and purchase. In these early centuries of the Westphalian order territory was the main factor that determined the security and wealth of states, and thus the protection and acquisition of territory were prime motivations of foreign policy." (216-217)

"The nineteenth century was, of course, the age of nationalism, which was spurred by the French Revolution and Napoleon's support for popular sovereignty and national self-determination. These intellectual currents began to alter peoples' views concerning the legitimacy of territorial conquests ... On the one hand, nationalism supported the precept that a territory belonged to a national grouping and it was wrong to take the land from a nation. On the other hand, nationalism provided grounds for a national grouping in one state trying to secede to form an independent state or to unite with its ethnic compatriots living in other states." (217)

"Three interrelated territorial issues during and at the end of WW1 were whether the victorious states should be able to take territory from the defeated, whether states should commit themselves to respect the territorial integrity of other states, and whether states should commit themselves to respect the territorial integrity of other states, and whether national self-determination should take precedence over respect for existing state boundaries in shaping the territorial order." (219)

First issue:
- In the early years of WW 1 the major states supported the right of victorious state to get territorial gains .... However in the 1919 Versailles settlement the victorious states received small territorial concessions in Europe.

Second issue:
- Woodrow Wilson was the strongest protagonist - "the members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League."

Third issue:
- There was tension between within democratic governments between protagonist of national self-determination and respect for existing boundaries; and the former generally lost. National self-determination for ethnic nations was not mentioned in the covenant, and at the Versailles conference self-determination for ethnic nations. Overall territorial boundaries of judicial states gained significant support in post-World War 1 settlement.

The territorial integrity norm was supported in several multilateral declarations and treaties. The 1928 General Treaty for the Renunciation of War ... The norm was then directly supported by the League's backing for the Stimson Doctrine in 1931, which denied the legitimacy of territorial changes obtained by force. (220).

At the end of World War II the Western Allied Powers exhibited very strong support for the integrity and interstate boundaries. With one exception they did not request or obtain sovereignty over any territories that belonged to the defeated powers ... 

### The Evolution of the Territorial Integrity Norm since 1945

**Europe** - only four interstate territorial wars have occurred in Europe since 1945. Only one of them (Turkey-Cyprus) led to a territorial change, and it could be reversed.

"Regarding the three wars among the states that emerged from the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991 and 1992, the European states and the United States supported the territorial boundaries that Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia possessed when they declared their independence in 1991 and 1992, and all the warring parties accepted them at the 1995 Dayton peace conference. Finally, in 1996 Yugoslavia, under considerable U.S. and European pressure, signed bilateral accords with Croatia and Bosnia accepting those borders." (224-228)

**The Americas** - In Latin America the principle of *uti possidetis* or the obligation to respect the boundaries inherited from the previous governing power, originated in the 1820s following the Latin American states' achievement of independence from Spain and Portugal. 

"Overall the Latin American countries have been strong opponents of coercive territorial aggrandizement, and the United States, of course, has exerted a strong influence in favour of the territorial integrity norm in the region." (229)

**Africa** - composed of a variety of ethnic groups, these groups straddle boundaries with neighbouring states. There are sociological pressures for territorial revisionism - this is why they've supported the principle of *uti possidetis*.

The Western powers have, for the most part, strongly supported the return of the occupied territories. In 1978, the United States mediated the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt that restored the Sinai Desert to Egypt, and in 1993 the Western powers were active in promoting the Oslo accord, which anticipates eventual Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. In December 1999, Israeli-Syrian negotiations concerning the return of the Golan Heights finally commenced. The territorial integrity norm continues to have an important impact on the conflict, since withdrawal from the occupied areas (or most of the areas) is a standard that the Western powers feel obligated to support and that the conflicting states will probably accept as a tolerable outcome.61 The 1948 armistice lines have taken on a legitimate status for many states, and it is likely that future Arab-Israeli accords will make only modest alterations in these borders.

**Asia** - Asia has witnessed twice as many territorial redistributions as all other regions combined... (232)

It is clear that there have been very few cases of coercive boundary change in the last half century during which UN membership has grown from 50 to 190. No longer is territorial aggrandizement the dominant motif of interstate politics; whereas in the three centuries leading up to 1946, about 80 percent of all interstate territorial wars led to territorial redistributions, for the period 1946-2000, the figure is 30 percent (twelve out of forty) (Table la). Given the huge increase in the number of states in the international system in the past half century and our definition of territorial wars for the period, the absolute numbers of forty territorial wars and twelve cases of major boundary change are not very large by historical standards. Two of the successful uses of force involved turbulent decolonization processes in 1947 and 1948 in the Indian subcontinent and former British Palestine, and the other ten occurred between 1961 and 1975. Of these ten wars, the UN passed resolutions calling for withdrawal in four of them (Israel-Arab states in 1967, India-Pakistan in 1971, Turkey-Cyprus in 1974, and Morocco-Spanish Sahara in 1975). Another three of the ten (India-Portugal in 1961, Indonesia-Netherlands in 1961-62, and North Vietnam-South Vietnam from 1962 to 1975) were viewed by many countries as stages of the decolonization process. The remaining two involved China's occupation of remote areas-parts of northern India in 1962 and South Vietnam's Paracel Islands in 1974.

An interesting characteristic of territorial wars concerns the role of international organizations in bringing them to an end, since multilateral response often reflect broad international backing for the norm. In the four territorial war in Europe (except for the quick war between Yugoslavia and Slovenia in 1991 the NATO states and the UN were active in promoting respect for boundaries. In the Western Hemisphere the OAS or an important group of OAS member was active in promoting a withdrawal of forces in two conflicts, and the U Backed withdrawal in the other. In Africa the OAU was very active in ten of the Twelve territorial wars (one being prior to the OAU's creation), and the UN played a role in several conflicts as well. In the Middle East the UN played a significant role in promoting a return to the status quo ante in three territorial wars (not the Arab-Israeli war of 1948). In Asia international organizations have not been active in most of the seventeen territorial wars. However, the UN had a major long-term role in promoting Indonesia's recent withdrawal from East Timor.

*The Boundaries of Successor States*

```ad-summary
"It is impossible to declare that the acceptance of internal administrative boundaries as interstate boundaries for secessionist states is now an authoritative rule of international practice. Quite possibly, however, this norm will become entrenched as a part of the new territorial order that flows from states' concern for reducing the incidence of destructive wars and wars' impact on commercial relations. States and International commercial interests increasingly abhor violence and uncertainty over what political entities have jurisdiction over particular geographical spaces." (236)
```

*Overview of Stages in the Development of the Norm*

Observations about the nineteenth century. The magnitude of international violence declined from 1815 to 1913 as a result of regular consultations within the framework of the Concert of Europe.

```ad-summary
title: 236 The Emergence Stage
The emergence stage of norm development started with the end of World War I and more particularly Article 10 of the League Covenant, and it lasted through the end of World War II. The major proponents of the norm were the Western democratic states. During this period major multilateral treaties and declarations for the first time upheld the territorial integrity norm-particularly the 1919 League Covenant, the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League's approval of the Stimson Doctrine in 1931. At the same time the great powers tolerated a number of territorial aggressions, and Germany, Italy, and Japan became increasingly committed to territorial expansion in the 1930s. The emergence stage was very bloody, but it was states' experience with this era of destructive territorial aggrandizement that increased support for the norm after World War II.
```

```ad-summary
title: 236-237
The acceptance stage of norm development began with the adoption of Article 2(4) in the UN Charter in June 1945, and it lasted until the mid-1970s. It was until the 1960s and early 1970s that broad and strong backing for the norm became palpable. The key post-1945 multilateral accords were the 1960 UN declaration that upheld the territorial integrity of states and pronounced that existing colonies (not ethnic groups) were eligible for self-determination; the OAU's 1963 charter provision and 1964 resolution supporting respect for inherited boundaries; and the 1975 CSCE's Helsinki Final Act with its proscription that boundaries could only be altered by consent. In 1975 the last case of significant territorial revisionism occurred-Morocco's absorption of the Spanish Sahara.

The institutionalization (strengthening) stage of norm development encompassed the period from 1976 to the present; no major cases of successful territorial aggrandizement have occurred during this period. The key events that strengthened the norm were states' responses to individual conflicts. Particularly noteworthy cases were Somalia's war against Ethiopia, 1976-80; Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, 1990-91; and Yugoslavia's attempts to absorb parts of Croatia and Bosnia, 1992-95. Also important was the decision by Indonesia in 1999 to allow a referendum in East Timor. Another noteworthy development during this period was the International Court of Justice's adjudication of several territorial conflicts; the court based its decisions on the principle of uti possidetis, which means that states have rights to those territories that were legally ceded to them by prior governing states and, of course, that other states do not have the right to take these territories by force.

### Root of territorial integrity norm

(237-238)

First, states have backed the norm for both instrumental and ideational reasons, though the former have dominated. Instrumental reasons are rooted in perceptions of how a norm and congruent practices benefit the self-interest of countries.

Second, the reasons for such a change in belief have varied among countries and no single factor explains the support for the norm among a particular grouping of states. These factors include the perceived relationship between territorial aggrandizement and major international wars, the power relations between possible territorial aggressors and the major powers supporting the norm, the costs and benefits of territorial aggrandizement, and moral predispositions concerning territorial aggression.

Did their liberal democratic ethos influence the acceptance of the norm? 

```ad-quote
title: 239
If the citizens of liberal states adhered to this principle of not imposing a new government on people by force, they would definitely be opposed to using force to change interstate boundaries-unless possibly a liberal state sought to assist the secession of a national minority in a foreign country. However, the dangers of supporting national secessionist groups have been clearly recognized by liberal democratic states. While self-determination for ethnic groups is at times viewed sympathetically by liberals, it is "trumped" by their recognition that the logical outcome of allowing self-determination for every national group would be continual warfare. Self-determination has had to be compromised in the pursuit of physical security, which is itself necessary for individuals' realization of liberty. Hence, democratic states' fear of major war and their respect for self-determination by juridical states are inextricably interrelated in their support for the territorial integrity norm.

Democratic states are reluctant to engage in territorial aggrandizement - reflected in their infrequent territorial aggressions since World War 1.

In dwelling whether association of territorial revisionism and major war or liberal respect for other states was a crucial factor: (241)
1. If democracy had not grown in the Western world during the 20 th century, would the Western states opt for sanctity of states' borders because of the linking of territorial revisionism *(would it have endured?)*
2. If territorial revisionism had not been a very important cause of major wars, would the democratic states have come down strongly for a prohibition against coercive territorial revisionism? Again it is doubtful.... They probably would have opted for the right of self-determination for all ethnic or national groups.

We must recognize that most of them had not experienced that most of them had not experienced very destructive territorial wars in recent centuries - their backing of the norm generally stems from the existence of *ethnic groups that overlap borders and can provoke territorial irredentism, the military weakness of many developing states vis-a-viz Western supports of the norm"* (241-242)

"Another concern that has been important in promoting support of the territorial integrity norm among developing states is their recognition that they will probably meet strong Western opposition if they embark on territorial aggression ... In some areas the Western powers sought to promote military balances between states where territorial revisionist wars could occur." (242)

Also, economic trends reduce the benefits and increase the costs of coercive territorial revisionism: (243-4)
1. "The declining value of land as a factor of production in modern economics means that the conquest of foreign territory no longer brings the same benefits that it did in the pre-industrial era." 
2. "Some scholars argue that the occupation of foreign territory is more difficult and costly in an era of national consciousness, and therefore states are less prone toward territorial expansionism."
3. "Finally, some political observer adopt a traditional liberal stance that war generally, and territorial wars in particular, are increasingly being rejected in this century because they disrupt valuable economic interdependencies were quite strong in 1914."

Another way to reflect is to look at what has happened to the incentives for territorial aggrandizement: the search for economic gains, the search for strategic gains, and the protection of national brethren.

The use of territorial aggrandizement to achieve strategic gain has concerned the occupation of territories.

The final motivation for territorial aggrandizement, protecting fellow nationals, has concerned the protection of ethnic compatriots who are being mistreated in other states and the unification of nationals in a single state.

A central source of the norm has been the industrialised world's fear that territorial revisionism could ignite a major war that would cause great human suffering. The experiences of the two world wars, a general understanding of territorial revisionism's encouragement of major wars.

There is not a simple answer to why the territorial integrity norm has emerged as a central pillar of the international order. Different reasons were key for two major groupings of states, and the coincidence of several factors seems to have been crucial to their backing. These key factors have wrought a major change in the international territorial order. Boundaries have not been frozen, but states have been effectively proscribed from altering them by force. The multistate political and security order is clearly stronger than many political observers think in that the society of states has largely eliminated what scholars have identified as the major source of enduring rivalries and the frequency and intensity of warfare.
