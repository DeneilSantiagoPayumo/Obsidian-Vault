# China and the Liberal International Order: A Pragmatic and Dynamic Approach
## Article Introduction

In recent years, a series of debates around the root causes of the crisis facing the LIO (law-based international order). Some argue for internal factors, others - external.

Some scholars believe that China is revisionist with ambitions to dismantle and replace the international order with an 'authoritarian-capitalist international order' whereas some offer more nuanced arguments.

That said, revisionism is not unique to a rising power. Every state engages with the LIO in a selective manner. In this article, we will review debates over China's relationship with the LIO and evaluate new dynamics in China's international practices within the LIO.

This article aims to establish a solid foundation for a nuanced understanding of China's current approach to the international order. First, we review the debate. Second, we review China's perceptions. Third, we analyse China's attitudes towards different subcomponents of the LIO. Then, we review China's latest responses to the current challenges of the LIO.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The debate around China's vision of international order

On the one hand, China has profited enormously from the current order, giving it opportunities for development and integration into the global system. But why would they want to undermine it? China's rise highlighted the difference between its political systems and values promoted by the US and its allies - liberal democracy, free enterprise, political freedom.

This confusion in understanding how or what path China will take in engaging with the LIO stems from a confusion to recognise two factors: the difference in how China and the West perceive the LIO, and the dynamic and multifaceted nature of China's response to different subcomponents of the LIO.
 
### Chinese perceptions of the LIO

```ad-quote
title: 1389, selective
Chinese academia believes that the establishment and maintenance of the LIO requires three conditions:
- The LIO is a product of the US pursuit and consolidation of its dominant position and is oriented to its own national interests and liberal values.
- The US power advantage, coupled with its system of global alliances, constitutes the security basis of the LIO
- Multilateral institutions that promote the liberal character of the US ... provide the necessary institutional foundation for the LIO.
```

```ad-quote
title: 1389-1390, selective, government discourse
China holds a very pragmatic position by putting emphasis on the objective foundations of the international order, rules-based multilateral and international framework. China is steadfast in its refusal to attach any ideological value to the international order.

By highlighting the role of international rules in generating and maintaining the international order, China plays down the significance of power and ideology and deems itself a strong upholder of the UN-centred order.
```

In contrast, the US regard liberal democratic values as core elements of te postwar international order. From the perspective of Chinese officials and scholars, the LIO presents itself as a an exclusive club that is fraught with ideologies.

```ad-summary
title: 1391
To sum up, when referring to the postwar international order, China calls it the ‘international order underpinned by international law’ while the West labels it the LIO. These differing labels reveal distinct value preferences. China takes a pragmatic approach and recognizes the UN-centred rule-based multilateral international framework as the core foundation of the postwar order. The western narratives, however, incorporate a strong ideological element by considering liberal values an intrinsic part of the postwar order. This perception gap has led to enormous misunderstandings and mutual recriminations between China and the West concerning the root causes of the crises of the current international order. When assessing China’s dissatisfaction with the LIO, it is important, therefore, to distinguish the (sub)components to which China refers. Specifically, whether China is criticizing the ‘reality part’ of the order (the UN-centred international laws and rules) or the ‘value part’ of the order (liberalism and democracy) makes a huge difference when it comes to interpreting China’s actual stance.

### The LIO's subcomponents and China's reaction

Let us identify China's approach with three key key subcomponents:

#### The international political/security order

China has:
1. Highlighted the importance of the international political and security order
2. Sovereign equality and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination are consistent with China's Five Principles of peaceful Coexistence
3. Driven by support for three factors; international regimes align with their aspirations to become a great power, emphasis on  sovereignty confers China with legitimately and institutional power, UN provides China a platform to showcase its commitment to multilateralism and address global issues such as climate change, terrorism, economic development. (1393)

#### The international economic order

China:
1. China is firmly supportive of the multilateral trade order. For the past two decades since its accession to the WTO, China has fulfilled its commitments and reaped enormous benefits for its development ... 
2. China is trying to increase its influence within the international financial order. In the WTO, members have an equal vote and equal ability to imitate the dispute resolution process
3. China attempts to complement the international development assistance order by contributing a Chinese approach ... With increasing economic power, with increasing economic power, China has increased its involvement in providing overseas development assistance ... Promoting economic development, instead of political reform, is China's primary concern. (1395) (See BRI - economic development and promoting the development of China's border provinces)

#### The regional economic order

In the Asia-Pacific region, the US has sought to create an inclusive, high-standard, and rules-based economic order.

1. China started being dismissive to accommodative - see attitude towards the contested Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), from an economic element seen as threatening their hegemony, to actively considering joining it. "The evolution of the official Chinese position towards the TPP from one of hostility and suspicion to a more positive stance reveals China’s pragmatic approach to regional order. Despite potential political and economic costs, China was convinced that joining the TPP would generate significant economic benefits." (1396)

China is thus pragmatic, tied up with three intertwined dynamic variables: China's domestic political and economic agenda; its national strength; and its relationship with the US.

### Challenges in China's response to LIO

```ad-quote
title: 1398
First, China’s proposals have become more ‘macro’ in character, evolving from regime-oriented to norm-oriented, with broader concepts such as the ‘community of common destiny for mankind’ and the offering, by way of the GDI, of Chinese solutions to global crises.86 China has also continued to align with some countries at the UN to advocate the idea of developmentalist human rights as an alternative to western human rights norms. 87 Second, China’s investment in inter national institution-building has increased: extending beyond the existing LIO architecture, it is seen by the West as a way to reshape global norms. Although the primary goals of China’s recent moves are linked more directly to domestic political and economic agendas, 88 there is no way that they will be easily overlooked as US–China strategic competition intensifies. As China seeks to become a rule contributor or maker, the US, as the ‘system maker and privilege taker’ and the upholder of western liberal values, 89 sees any moves from politically illiberal China as ideologically unacceptable.

## Conclusion

China and West hold different perceptions - China is pragmatic, emphasizing the UN-centred rules-based multilateral international framework and the West regards liberal values as an integral part of the postwar order.

China's deteriorating relations with the US provide reasons for pessimism however China still largely supports the current order. It may have a different vision but it does not want to change the core element of that order: China's cognition of the international order contains three sets of genes: pro-West and liberal, anti-West and revolutionary, and pro-globalization and growth driven.
