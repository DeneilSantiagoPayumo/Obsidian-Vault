# WORLDMAKING AFTER EMPIRE
# Introduction

## A collection of key ideas from the article

This book studies the global projects of decolonization black Anglophone anticolonial critics and nationalists spearheaded in the three decades after the end of the Second World War. The author argues that decolonisation of reordering the world that sought to create a domination-free and egalitarian international order. Against the standard view of decolonization as a moment of nation-building in which the anticolonial demand for self-determination culminated in the rejection of alien rule and the formation of nation-states, self-determination ensured that institutions in this realm would secure non-domination.

Empire was a form of domination that exceeded the bilateral relations of colonizer and colonized. As a result, it required a global anticolonial counterpart that would undo the hierarchies that facilitated domination.

This book takes the history of European imperialism as itself a world-constituting force that inaugurated an unprecedented era of globality - genocide, forced migration, circulation of commodities transformed the conditions of economic and political life.

Chapter 3 (the only recommended chapter in the reading list) looks at the United Nations where anticolonial nationalists staged their reinvention of self-determination. The author runs through political thought of: [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] ,[[W, E. B. Du Bois]],  [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[George Padmore]] to illustrate how this reinvention saw empire as enslavement.

The right to self-determination marked the transformation of colonial domination - guarantees of independence and equality secured the conditions of international non-domination necessary for the domestic exercise of self-governance.

The anticolonial account of self-determination marked a radical break from the Eurocentric model of international society and established nondomination as a central ideal of a post-imperial world order - we should identify this vision with an anti-imperialism that imagined an egalitarian world order.

# Chapter 3: From Principle to Right: The Anticolonial Reinvention of Self-Determination

This chapter discusses how self-determination emerged as a right and examines the implications of this. Anticolonial nationalists reinvented the meaning of self-determination through a novel critique of imperialism that centred on the problems of slavery and racial hierarchy - a contested and contingent reinvention, secured in the face of opposition and deep suspicion.

The anticolonial right to self-determination created the legal context in which sovereignty within independent states could be instituted.

There were limits - the formation of empire as enslavement and commitment to territorial integrity could not address settler colonial context or secession in new postcolonial states and the anticolonial view that human rights were to be secured in self-government and statehood offered no response to when states violated the rights of citizens.

 ### Rethinking Anticolonial Appropriation

Historians treat anticolonial politics at the UN as an extension of the organisation's founding documents. It ignores the continuities between the League of Nations and the UN and dismisses the disappointment of anticolonial critics, with anticolonial nationalism and decolonisation assimilated into a progressive history of postwar ideals and institutions.

```ad-quote
title: 77
In the context of twentieth-century decolonization, self-determination was the target of this kind of reinvention. Staking out the countours of anticolonial reinvention requires rethinking the politics of appropriation as a creative intervention that responded to specific political questions and conditions ... On this view, the right to self-determination was not continuous with prior versions of the principle. Instea,d it was remade and reconstituted in response to a particular way of posing the problem of empire ... anticolonial nationalists increasingly framed empire as enslavement and conceived of the right to self-detemrination as the response to this problem. In the pairing of question and answer, the anticolonia account of self-determination was invented.
```

The historical background helped to elevate this response: (78)
* Metropolitan intransigence through alternative demands for equal rights and institutional integration put forward by African labour movements laid the ground for self-determination
* The UN, the emerging language of human rights, and the Cold War created openings for the pairing of empire as enslavement with the right to self-determination.
* The Cold War allowed postcolonial states to use their growing majority to bypass the stalemate in the Security Council and transform the General Assembly into a site of political action

### Empire as Enslavement

The dual critique of empire as a form of enslavement and international racial hierarchy emerged in the context of renewed interest in the history of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery among black intellectuals.

Du Bois and peers linked the enslavement of Africans to the emergence of the Bourgeoisie and the rise of industrialisation, rejecting a narrative of abolition to an account that centred the role of the enslaved in achieving emancipation. They also linked the 19th century struggle for emancipation to 20th century decolonization.

They highlighted the ways in which slavery was a modern form of labour extraction and exploitation, establishing continuities between New World slavery and colonialism in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The through-line linking New World slavey and the scramble for Africa was a structure of domination and exploitation that helped to transcend limited definitions of slavery, combining an emphasis on arbitrary power and domination with a Marxist critique of exploitation. (paraphrased, 81).

They revealed that the economic interests of European powers were the underlying motivations for imperialism - a long history of economic exploitation.

[[Kwame Nkrumah]]: expulsion from land and taxation were the primary means in which colonial subjects in Africa were forced into production for export - colonial subjects took employment in European-owned mines and plantations, forcing an independent peasantry to depend on wage labour (which was not considered slavery).

[[W, E. B. Du Bois]] and [[George Padmore]] - colonial labour practices are just slavery, differentiating between metropolitan and colonial labour. A powerful trade union movement followed industrialisation and shifted the balance of power but in the colonies trade unions were illegal and if they existed most African workers remained unorganized.

Anticolonial critics argued that:
1. Liberal and benevolent alien rule was not an option as it contained despotism
2. Native rulers would not rectify the threat of arbitrary power as since no democratic principles are applied, they represented arbitrary power - entailing a vision of the state as one that included all inhabitants as citizens and was democratic, development and redistributive. "Native rule had to take the form of democratic self-government to adequately overcome domination and exploitation" (84)

This critique left unaddressed the specificities of the settler colonial experience in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa - failing to recognise dispossession as a separate and autonomous form of imperial injustice due to heavy focus on Africa.

### From Principle to Right

The transformation of self determination from principle to right was incredibly important - once a contested claim that great powers rejected and later acquiesced

"Beyond linking self-determination to the achievement of individual rights domestically, anticolonial nationalists also argued that the right to self-determination was a better foundation for international peace." (89)

1. Colonialism was conceived as a form of slavery in which the colonized were rightless subjects, only with a recognition of a right to self-determination could bondage of colonialism be overcome
2. Foreign rule was identified as an impediment to world peace - international hierarchy enabled violence against subject people but also incited imperial competition between states.

Here, self-determination now entailed freedom from foreign rule and intervention secured through equal membership within international society.

### Founding an Anti-imperial World Order

The right to self-determination was always a first step in political and economic transformations.

To understand the significance of the right to self-determination, we must consider its relationship to human rights more generally - there has been important debate among historians about the relationship between anticolonial nationalism and human rights.

As anticolonial critics turned toward independence, this existing language informed their critique of colonial rule and was supplemented by the emerging international discourse of human rights.

These references to human rights marked a new chapter in an evolving tradition of rights talk - this mobilization of human rights discourse was always situated in a broader account of empire as enslavement. Using the institutional and discursive opening made possible by the language of human rights, representatives of postcolonial states elevated the violation of human rights in the colony and it was conceived as prerequisite for other human rights.

Anticolonial nationalists relationships was more than an instrumental and strategic invocation of human rights - human rights were in in the anticolonial account realizable only as the rights of citizens.

[[Hannah Arendt]] - the UDHR were beset by a "lack of reality", she was worried that it would neglect the right to have rights - the right to belong to some kind of organized community.

Rightlessness for Arendt illustrated that the moment human beings lacked their own government and had to fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect them - only when they can belong to a community can human rights be guaranteed.

"Equality in the international order preserved the independence of each political community. It ensured that the powerful states of the world would not dominate weaker and smaller members of international society, denying the latter the external freedom required for internal self-government." (98)

"The right to self-determination mitigated the effects of the substantive hierarchies that structured international society, by limiting the exercise of power between states. Self-determination thus created the external conditions for "political and legal relationships within a polity by establishing domestic jurisdiction and differentiating among distinct legal and political systems. In this sense, the right to self-determination set juridical limits on domination in the international sphere and aimed for a "domination-free" international society."  (98)

The characterization of Westphalia as inaugurating an international society of sovereign and equal states ignores the imperial history of sovereign inequality and hierarchy.
