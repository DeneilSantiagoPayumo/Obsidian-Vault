## Chapter 4: Poverty

First, we had Mercantilism, incentivized people to work hard and that poverty should be accepted. Karl Marx - extreme poverty had already been reduced by three-quarters.

Asia - integrated into the global economy, better trade and investment to  make it possible for low and middle income countries to prosper.

Chinese communist party learned from the Asian 'tiger' economies of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, allowing special economic zones. Production was based on market forces, investments and technology.

Improved wages and labour conditions - Guandong became a manufacturing and export powerhouse.

Benefit of urbanization and liberalization - markets care about what people can do and at what price. Competition lead to more favour in workers in lower *Dalits*.

Material improvements of dalits has gone hand in hand with the social empowerment of the poor.

Effect on self-esteem and prejudice is crucial since poverty is not just a material condition, psychological one - loss, grief, anguish, worry, overthinking, madness, frustration, anxiety...

"At the same time, global population has grown dramatically, so it could be that the number of poor has grown even though the proportion is declining. But nobody would claim that unemployment is rising in a society where the unemployment rate has halved from ten to  ve per cent, only because its population has slightly more than doubled over the same period. It would  be  appropriate  here  to  consider  the  philosopher  John Rawls’s thought experiment about the ‘veil of ignorance’: if you had to choose a society to live in but did not know what your social  or  economic  position  would  be,  you  would  probably choose the society with the lowest proportion (not the lowest numbers) of poor, because this is the best judgement of the life of an average citizen."

Historic rupture: for the first time, poverty is not growing just because population is growing. Theories on how to fight poverty, global institutions wrestle with the question of how to make growth 'pro-poor'. Income growth led by average growth rather than changes in income distribution.

Here, the poor are using new opportunities to participate in modern patterns of production and trade to make themselves rich: not the same as 'trickle-down' which assumes if the rich gets richer, crumbs will fall to the poorest.

Growth synonymous with boons and a reduction in conflict.

Overall: huge growth will eliminate poverty

## Chapter 5: Violence

War and violence used to be the natural state of humanity. Now - different. Steven Pinker is drawn upon in this volume.

Everyday violence was everywhere - puppet shoes, Grimm brothers, Ancient Greek epics (the Iliad), the Bible, gladiators, naked women torn apart, colosseum...

Violence is not an exception, not an everyday occurrence, human sacrifice abolished by animal sacrifice, violent death has decreased

Pacification associated with early agricultural civilization - hierarchical and reduce feuding and deaths and homicides

Then, institution of judicial rules and central governments, laws and punishments, early justice system...

Giving the people control over the government, rule of law, civil liberties and democracies.

Another factor - moral individualism, cultural shift towards individual responsibility and liberation from collective bonds.

Third, the rise of humanitarian attitudes - life expectancy increases, perceived value of each human life increases.

The 20th century not bloody:
1. We are drawn to recent headlines
2. World population is bigger so ergo more violence, societies fragile so war becomes more devastating.

Look at Sweden - great European power, lost its eastern half (Finland) to Russia, and then as opportunity for modest affluence increased, Swedish elites lost their interest in military adventures.

Great power - at war seventy-five to 100% of the years, trend downwards.

War inevitable, but now can be avoided and can be lost...

Only way for terrorist to win is if victims overreact, dismantle civil liberties, blame whole groups for the actions of a few.

But the overall trends are strong. Increasing wealth and health  and  smaller  families  seem  to  have  made  us  value  life more, and this has resulted in more humanitarian attitudes and a stronger interest in peace. Commerce and trade has made countries more interested in mutually benecial exchange than in zero-sum games. To this we may add an entirely new phenomenon among affluent liberal democracies: something we might call a true peace.  Either people and leaders can’t even dream of going to war against each other again, even traditional arch enemies like France and Germany.


## Epilogue

People are ignorant of the progress made in the world - world poverty has decreased, but many people in Britain think it has. 

Assumptions formed by the media that reinforces a particular way of looking at the world.

Steven Pinker:
1. Bad is stronger than good, we notice them more effect
2. Psychology of moralization
3. Nostalgia

Does not guarantee progress: financial crisis, global warming, large-scale war, terrorists, curtail freedom...

The causes of human progress are  firmly entrenched – the growth of science and knowledge, the expansion of co-operation and trade, and the freedom to act on this. But historically this  has  been  blocked  and  destroyed  by  forces  that  do  not accept change, because they fear it or because it threatens their position
