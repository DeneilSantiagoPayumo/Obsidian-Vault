# Great power politics: the Cold War and bipolarity

## A collection of key ideas from the article

One enduring question is whether bipolarity or the existence of nuclear weapons did more to explain the character of the Cold War.

Was bipolarity stable because a two-party, zero-sum game eliminated uncertainty? Or was it intrinsically unstable as only the fear of national obliteration stopped it from spiralling into war.

The rivalry between the US and the USSR developed from ceasefire lines of WW2. The US tried to ring the Soviet bloc with allies to prevent their expansion whereas the Soviet response was to breach these containment barriers.

This explains the significance of crises in Berlin, Korea, Cuba, the Middle East and Vietnam, crucial to maintaining or breaching lines of containment.

Two components of analysis - patterns of amity and enmity (a sense of othering) but there was theoretical differences over how Soviet Otherness and enmity was constituted.

[[Kennan]] (1947) - containment of the Soviet Union, encroaching on the 'interests of a peaceful and stable world.'

[[Kenneth Waltz]] - "bipolarity exerted a disciplining effect on the leaders of great power states that will encourage them to act in ways better than their character may lead them to expect."
Two assumptions - international polarity held a stronger explanatory power than unit-level factors like ideology or leadership and that the Soviet Union was fundamentally a rational actor capable of understanding that managing nuclear bipolarity rather than embarking on an expansionist military policy would be in its own best interests.

No easy to settle questions as Western access to information was restricted, and intentions deduced from a combination of observed behaviour.

### Technological development

The author quotes Browns (1977:153) that:

There was a fear that a failure to keep up would make one's nuclear forces vulnerable to first strike by the enemy. Any development would neutralise the effects of mutual deterrence by fear of retaliation. (paraphrased, 77)

"In other words, possession of a nuclear arsenal sufficient for 'assured destruction' would basically suffice, leading to a so-called 'minimum deterrence' strategy. Others, taking a maximum deterrence strategy, calculated that a ruthless rational actor ... would require not only a **threat** of high damage, but also a near certain **probability** that such a retaliation would be delivered, before deterrence could be effective." 80

This was based under the *ex ante ex post* dilemma - threat that 'leaves something to chance', where potential attackers would be deterred by a fear of an irrational response by an individual level or bureaucratic one.

**Minimum deterrence** - stability in easy parity but vulnerable to ruthless opponents.

Allowed incentives for 'horizontal' nuclear proliferation making it easier for lesser powers to acquire a great equalisers. Bipolarity defined a nuclear club of two and associated nuclear weapons with superpower status.

US and the USSR did not want nuclear powers - focusing on industrialised states like Germany and Japan but shifted to Third World States such as Argentina, Brazil and India, and Israel and the Middle East and South Africa. (paraphrased, 80)

**Maximum deterrence** - higher entrance costs to would-be nuclear weapons states and an expensive arms race for existing nuclear weapons state.

This closed loopholes and found other ways around the swift military paralysis of nuclear deterrence. "Dealing with this contingency required demands for huge and elaborate forces capable of responding to aggression at any level, and of maintaining 'escalation dominance' throughout a complicated and possibly extended spectrum of conventional and nuclear warfighting." (81)

Extended Deterrence (82) links the technological driver to the great power politics - but when the USSR was able to obtain nuclear weapons, how could European allies believe that the US would retaliate against the USSR for an attack on West Germany when the consequence would be Soviet retaliation on American cities?

It provided incentives for the European powers to acquire their own nuclear deterrents and made for a permanent crisis in NATO about the credibility of its deterrent posture and the division of labour between the US and its European allies. It pushed the US into taking various measures to strengthen its commitment and to increase the risks to the USSR of salami tactics by such measures as integrating so-called 'tactical' nuclear weapons.

The flexible response led to the logic of maximum deterrence by finding force deployments.

### The pressure of current affairs and 'events'

Bipolarity and nuclear weapons were not the only driving forces in play - Berlin (blockade and building of the wall), the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Middle Eastern Oil crisis and the Suez crisis that pitched long-term allies Britain and US against each other and confirmed the inability of European powers to operate independently from the US.

Crisis in Berlin and Korea events that confirmed the expansionist view of the Soviet and the need for containment, inaugurating a major rearmament in the US and consolidated the idea of a 'communist bloc' and provided an example of ED and containment problems.

The Cuba Missile Crisis generated an interest in crisis management as an area of concern - underlining the dangers of escalation and exposed the need for reliable communication between Washington and Moscow - understanding the actual and potential production of irrationality in foreign policy making ... arms control, detente, hotline

The Middle East crisis underlined the problem of unwanted escalation as a consequence of being drawn into regional conflicts on behalf of their allies - the interlocking of their alert systems signalled a form of escalation in which automated systems ratcheted up levels of alerts.

It put economic security and international terrorism onto the ISS agenda and introduced interdependence and International Political economy into IR and agendas. The use of the oil weapon by Arab states forced the US to notice that Western prosperity and hegemony depended on availability of cheap oil. It triggered awareness that denial of strategic resources could be seen as a strategic threat.

This drew the US into the Middle East on the side of Israel, creating contradictory objectives (support for Israel and maintenance of stable relations with the oil-producing states) that would entrap US foreign policy over the subsequent decades.

The Vietnam war - theories of US containment policy, domino effect, events in Africa and Central America combining to literature on guerrilla war and counterinsurgency and exposing the difficulties for the US in fighting limited wars as part of containment.

It generated doubt in the US about the utility of force in general.
