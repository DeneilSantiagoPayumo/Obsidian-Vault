"The true history of human rights matters most of all, then, in order to confront their prospects today and in the future. If they do capture many longstanding values, it is equally critical to understand more honestly how and when human rights took shape as a wide-spread and powerful set of aspirations for a better and more humane world. After all, they have done far more to transform the terrain of idealism than they have the world itself. In and through their emergence as the last utopia after predecessors and rivals collapsed, The movement’s most difficult quandaries were already set. Though they were born as an alternative to grand political missions—or even as a moral criticism of politics—human rights were forced to take on the grand political mission of providing a global framework for the achievement of freedom, identity, and prosperity. They were forced, Slowly but surely, to assume the very maximalism they triumphed by avoiding. This contemporary dilemma is what has to be faced squarely, yet history as celebration of origins will not help in doing so. Few things that are powerful today turn out on inspection to be longstanding and inevitable. And the human rights movement is certainly not one of them. But this also means that human rights are not so much an inheritance to preserve as an invention to remake—or even leave behind—if their program is to be vital and relevant in what is already a very different world than the one into which it came so recently. No one knows yet for sure, in light of the inspiration they provide and the challenges they face, what kind of better world human rights can bring about. And no one knows whether, if they are found wanting, Another utopia can arise in the future, just as human rights once emerged on the ruins of their predecessors. Human rights were born as the last utopia—but one day another may appear." - 10

### International Law and Human Rights 
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

Now, it seems self-evident that the point of international law is to protect individual human rights. Debates swirl around whether the injection of human rights law into international affairs genuinely improves them. What has received less attention, however, is how recently international lawyers themselves turned to their now familiar concern with human rights.

In organizing themselves in the mid-nineteenth century as a new profession, international lawyers adopted the goal of mastering power through rules. Formalizing actual interstate relations mattered, it was hoped, because formalization itself—the construction of rules supervised by a benevolent and progressive caste of enlightened jurists would bring more humanity to world affairs. States would not have to sacrifice sovereignty, which indeed had to be regarded as the foundation stone of world order. But international rules achieved through treaty and custom would inevitably lead sovereigns away from fruitless contention and toward harmonious integration. International lawyers would advance civilization through their patient work, as rules themselves—interpreted in an increasingly enlightened way made belligerency recede. Their mission was, of course, always a difficult one, albeit largely self-imposed.

"In particular, they were aware that the Dumbarton Oaks agreements of 1944—which unveiled the great power foundations of postwar order for all to see meant the end of human rights and not the beginning ... only the passing of the anti-colonialist moment in human rights history and the surprising reclamation of human rights in their antitotalitarian guise in the 1970s led international lawyers to re-evaluate their long confirmed positions in this regard." (178)

"The forging of the peace, and especially the founding of the United Nations, signaled to all international lawyers that the reign of state sovereignty had not seen its last days, and by and large they respectfully fell in line. In the Dumbarton agreements, human rights were practically omitted, while in the UN Charter they were reduced to embellishment—a fact that international lawyers were well positioned to understand. It was more worrisome, in any case, that not only human rights but also international law itself seemed to be out of place against the background of the era’s grim realism." (181)

"In this crisis of relevance, disarray reigned. It was not even obvious that the promotion of peace that international law was supposed to shoulder in some new way definitely implied a turn to the individual, let alone human rights. Scepticism, not enthusiasm, also applied to what many felt to be rear guard appeals to “natural law.” That concept certainly did have some play, following from the temptation to blame twentieth-century disaster on the “positivism” according to which all valid norms originated in the state." (183)

For such reasons, there is very little evidence that the international law bar welcomed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it came, as they were well aware that its achievement had come at the price of legal enforceability. Apart from the Frenchman Renécassin and the Canadian John Humphrey, lawyers were not prominent in its formulation in 1946–48.

"The concept of human rights remained yet more peripheral in legal affairs outside the small college of international lawyers, not simply because of American Cold War imperatives, but also because of the effect of legal realism on many law professors. Pretending to play the skunk at the garden party at the meeting of the American Society of International Law in 1959, international relations specialist Stanley Hoffmann put things bluntly: “in a world in which total politicization has eliminated those areas of domestic and international affairs from which governments used to stay away, it seems to me perfectly vain to hope for an escape from politics . . . To press forward in the field of universal definitions of human rights is an invitation to hypocrisy and to heightening political tensions. (189)”

"Human rights were already on the way out for the few international lawyers who had made them central in war time, with the Cold War extending rather than upsetting their fate. One important reason was the persistence of state sovereignty in Postwar doctrine. True, European international lawyers seem to have preferred far earlier than their American colleagues a slight relaxation of the state’s centrality in international law. Cassin could argue That with human rights a breakthrough had occurred with a great future ahead of it. Other Europeans agreed, albeit less exultantly. Max Huber, a Swiss international lawyer famed for his interwar sociological work, treated the human rights developments of the 1940s. Optimistically, citing Lauterpacht’s work approvingly, without mentioning the supervening Cold War; in one of his last articles, Boris Mirkine-Guetzévitch, interwar founder of comparative constitutionalism, wrote similarly. In West Germany and Austria, the move from Positivism to naturalism in law waned as time passed, but some, notably Alfred Verdross, once Kelsen’s student—argued for human Rights as the necessary inference from human dignity for decades." (191)

"Human rights as an organizing concept were largely absent through the 1950s and 1960 s from the American discipline. And the unfolding of postwar history showed that the last ditch utopia of rules and its strategic combination with realist insights into power could often marginalize the concept of human rights yet further, rather than husbanding doctrine to await more propitious circumstances ... Indeed, the “Bill of Rights” Clark and Sohn appended to their proposal was meant, evidently on the model of American constitutionalism, to provide negative rights against the United Nations itself (presumably due to the relative strengthening of the federal centre, just as had eventually become necessary when the U.S. Constitution was framed). In other words, through much of the era Sohn was very far from moving toward direct protection of the individual as the path he later claimed international law followed all along." (192)

"It was the process of decolonization that made the fortune of human rights at the United Nations—albeit with a stark reconceptualization of their meaning, grounded in the collective right of self-determination. Paradoxically, this transformation made rights still less central for international lawyers. One might go so far as to claim that it was not World War II and genocide, but anticolonialism and decolonization, that really broke International lawyers’ long-term apologia for the state and its projects. Even before decolonization, the state continued its doctrinal rule." (195)

"Whether in anger or by argument, American lawyers refused to follow human rights where the UN’s new states took them." (199)

"It was far more the essential, and external, context of global ideological change in the 1970 s that accounts for how human rights became central to American international law for the first time. " (201)

We can look at the career of Louis Henkin, a leading figure on the American scene.
	Tasked by the AJC to evaluate likely political trends in the 1970 s, Henkin signed on to the organization’s long-affirmed position that “Jewish rights are human rights.” (202)

Sohn—who strikingly taught the first Harvard Law School course on the topic the same year— published the pioneering casebook in 1973, together with Thomas Buergenthal, his influential student. Late the same year, Henkin testified at Donald Fraser’s congressional hearings on American foreign policy and human rights. There, he ruefully reported no real consensus around even what human rights meant, given the developments since the immediate postwar moment when “the U.N. was much smaller and dominated by Western states and Western ideas.” Now, except for more general agreement on egalitarianism, the rise of the third world, along with the continuing influence of communism, meant conflict over the very definition of the idea. The only imaginable remedy for the “sense of crisis about international protection of human rights” was UN reform. Given that the rise of grassroots NGOs (which Henkin rarely mentioned) and even Fraser’s own hearings mattered because they portended bypassing the UN as an exclusive forum for the human rights idea, it is a revealing affirmation.

Yet in many ways, in spite of this bumpy trajectory, Henkin’s own new enthusiasm for human rights suppressed the exact historical conditions for its occurrence, whether in his own career or in the larger context of forces like NGOs and events like Carter’s presidency that made it possible.

n this sense, Henkin’s case remains powerfully illustrative. To this day, there has been very little self-reflexive understanding among American international lawyers about what the exact historical conditions were in which they made human rights central. From this moment, Henkin and others threw themselves into the mission of popularizing international law’s renovated purposes. Beyond a breathtaking shift of interpretive protocols, devotion to teaching the new international law, another hallmark of disciplinary reinvention, took pride of place.51 Of course, one cannot take the story of conversion, either by Henkin or by the larger discipline, too far. Henkin famously rejected the concept of sovereignty, even as in his revised theory of international law states retained their centrality, perhaps even as a normative commitment, and not simply as a matter of the facts of the world. And Henkin’s overwhelming enthusiasm was for political and civil rights, not others—which once again made him a man of his time. But in the postwar discipline of American international law, it was a grand departure. In Henkin’s career, and for the future of the discipline through the present, the age of rights—certainly for international lawyers—had been born.

Yet it would be misleading to suggest that international law provided simply one domain among others where the power of this human rights explosion registered. The turn by dissidents like Aleksandr Esenin-Volpin and Václav Havel to human rights was also, and explicitly, a revival of the plausibility of abstract norms as a vehicle of moral progress; and though they owed the general intellectual renewal of formalism to arguments by Eastern European dissidents, it was fateful that international lawyers were the existing custodians of international legal forms to which those very figures appealed. The lawyers had husbanded formalism without rights during an era of realist dominance. But they were the natural inheritors of a reactivated formalism revolving around the rights they had earlier marginalized. Hence the paradox: the rise of human rights in international law occurred not for reasons internal to international law as a profession, but due to the ideological changes that set the stage for a moral triumph of human rights—one that in turn gave a whole new relevance to the field’s mission. 

It is impossible to isolate the path of the law from its intersections with social action. Human rights, like other similar norms, depended on a rising social movement to be canonized by lawyers, certainly as a professional idea and priority. But the human rights movement was simply one social movement among others. A prior and far more global social movement, anticolonialism, received a considerably more guarded reception in the theory and practice of Western, including American, international lawyers. The version in which international human rights spiked in the West in general - with overwhelming focus on political and civil rights—meant that the earliest affiliations of most international lawyers gave those commitments exclusive priority too. Henkin’s career provides an excellent illustration of both facts. This starting point had a profound effect on doctrine and practice, and explains why the huge panoply of rights theorized and pursued by international lawyers since the 1970s have had to be added over time rather than pursued from the outset. Even as human rights provided the grounds for a reconstitution of their discipline, international lawyers, like members of other sectors of the human rights movement, faced the forbidding task of determining how this late-come concept could address a growing range of global political concerns. Today, the law plays an altogether unprecedented and unusual role in how the international forum is imagined and how aspirations for change in its arrangements are pursued. Thanks to the new plausibility it gave abstract norms, the human rights movement made international law a privileged instrument of moral improvement and, indeed, provided it enormous appeal as a framework for idealistic pursuits. But it was to be fateful for the future that international law could come to occupy a role in the moral imagination that, given the discipline’s own circuitous path to human rights, it had not won for itself. And the debt of international lawyers to a very specific social movement meant that they would not simply inherit a fund of powerful energy but also face serious constraints in advancing an idealistic agenda in later years.
