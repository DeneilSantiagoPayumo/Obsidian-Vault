## Article Introduction

The problem is that ideational models depend on an implicit or explicit contrast to explanations rooted in changing material incentives. How and how much ideas matter naturally depend on how and how much material incentives matter. In the case of the Cold War's end, the objective of a more sophisticated approach to the study of ideas is currently hampered less by the quantity of plausible models than by deficiencies in our understanding of the material incentives facing decisionmakers.

In this article we provide a more complete understanding of the material pressures facing Soviet policymakers in the 1980s - analysing material incentives and importantly the changing structure of global production.

Second, we explore how Soviet relative decline affected the course of the Cold War in its final years. In recent years, new primary and secondary sources have become available that dramatically alter our earlier understandings of the material pressures on Soviet policymakers. We analyse how Moscow's experience of decline compares with other great powers and draw on recent evidence concerning how perceptions of decline, new ideas, and now foreign policies were related.

Third, we explore evidence on the role and attitudes of conservative or hard-line Soviet officials.


### A collection of key ideas from the article

Ideational models are flawed for two reasons:  scholars carefully specify material incentives facing Soviet decisionmakers and secondly scholars counterpose their argument against an impoverished understanding of material incentives.

Scholars of the second reason typically use [[Kenneth Waltz]]'s reading - Neorealist understanding of material incentives is too narrow to provide a productive backdrop.

This analysis is framed on a global level to answer two critical questions: why did the Soviets choose retrenchment instead of foreign policy status quo, and why did the Soviets engage in retrenchment and at the same time pursue engagement by opening up to the global economy.

This analysis is restricted in two critical ways: the author defines material incentives solely in terms of maintaining the status quo, and material costs are exclusively defined as economic costs.


### Idea 1: an understanding of the material pressures facing Soviet policymakers in the 1980s.

The root of the Soviet Union's problem was declining growth - "from the vantage of 1985 the Soviet Union was about to begin declining in absolute terms or it was doomed to stagnate in a slow-growth equilibrium - unless something was done to reverse a twenty-year secular trend." (16)

Soviet economic performance also took a sudden turn for the worse - raw numbers on output and productivity highlight quantity rather than quality. "Soviet-type economies were especially dependent on high growth rates because the low quality of goods and bad maintenance led to a very high turnover rate for all products in the economy." (17) Additionally, most goods that were produced and counted as part of Soviet growth were useless.

"For these reasons, slow growth created severe problems for Soviet policymakers. Backlogs, bottlenecks, chronic shortages, increased waste due to deteriorating infrastructure." (17-18)

Thereby, the Soviet Union was losing a lot of competitiveness.


Are there any reasons why the Soviet Union would reorient its foreign policy more strongly?

1. "The bipolar distribution of power meant that the Soviet elite has a single, unambiguous "reference group" for measuring its relative position." (22) Any loss in power would go to their rivals. Relative gain calculations are indeterminate.
2. "The Soviet Union was a declining challenger to U.S. primacy." (22) ... "The Soviet Union could challenge the United States only if its relative capabilities were increasing. Once a challenger began to decline steadily, it will eventually have to change its role." (23) The outer limits of a state's capabilities are determined by its economic output - Moscow *must* extract more from its economy. Otherwise it will have to change its role, accompanied by an intellectual change and anguish from the elite.
3. "The Soviet Union was a challenger with a far more acute case of imperial overstretch than the reigning hegemon." (23) "The economic burden of the Soviet position in Eastern Europe was also rapidly escalating at this time" (24) - goods were falling behind world's standards and were lower equality, and the marginal cost of extracting the energy and raw materials they supplied were increasing. "The East European countries suffered a marked slowdown at this time in both technological competitiveness and economic growth." (25)
4. "Relative decline placed more pressure on Soviet grand strategy than it did on that of earlier declining powers was the particular nature of the Soviet Union's technological lag with its rivals." The Soviet policymakers realised that they needed to match the technological advancement. What about nuclear weapons?

Essentially, the logic of the USSR's international position made its grand strategy incredibly sensitive.

### Idea 2: What changed?

For material change to affect policy, it must be perceived. Soviet policy makers were acutely aware of these issues.

The evidence regarding Gorbachev suggests an early reluctance to face the tough trade-offs implicit in major change. A lot of expensive policies appeared to reflect the assumption that an accelerated Soviet economy would deliver the funds necessary for growth, and that the vaunted military-industrial sector was the key to increased productivity. It didn't work and it resulted in Gorbachev turning to more radical changes in Soviet foreign policy practices.

```ad-quote
"If the country's capabilities were in danger of falling behind, then they had to be augmented, or those against which they were arrayed had to be diminished. The great attraction of foreign policy retrenchment lay in its promise to tackle both problems at once." (33)
```

It would reduce the cohesion of opposing states and contribute to increasing Soviet relative capabilities by easing resource constraints. Thereby, we downsize the military and scale back the costs of empire.


Soviet relative decline however does not account for the integrative thrust of Gorbachev's policy - his tendency towards westernization. This interpretation fails to note the rapidly changing structure of global production.

Three shifts: (35)
1. The upswing in the number and importance of interfirm alliances
2. The increased dispersion of production
3. The growing opportunity cost of being isolated from foreign direct investment (FDI).

```ad-quote
title: 36
"The Soviet Union and its allies were isolated from them [MNCs]; and they achieved their greater salience among Soviets' international competitors - the United States and its allies. Thus "globalisation" was not global: It took sides in the Cold War."
```

These handicaps increased in relative importance as the cost of technological development spiralled upwards.

In the Soviet Union, there was a recognition that the structure of global production was fundamentally changing - international economic linkages were increasing and changing qualitatively as MNCs were becoming more significant and leading to the "internationalization of production". 

To act on this, Gorbachev's impulse was to "transfuse" ideas. These pressures were most important because they increased the impetus to initiate retrenchment, having to change their security strategy due to the West's policy of "economic containment". The only way to reduce Western restrictions was to moderate foreign policy, increasing the desire among new thinkers to initiate retrenchment but also made it easier to convince sceptical hard-liners.

In the end, the growing economic costs of Soviet isolation from the globalization of production created strong incentives for engaging in retrenchment irrespective of Gorbachev's underlying motivations. And retrenchment made sense as a response to the growing costs of Soviet economic isolation even if taking this course did not make it possible for the Soviets quickly to enjoy the fruits of globalization. (43)

### New to Old Thinkers

In the end, old thinkers simply could not deny the existence of the rapidly mounting material pressures on the Soviet Union's foreign policy. 50

The argument turned from "no cuts are needed" to "some are needed" and more.
