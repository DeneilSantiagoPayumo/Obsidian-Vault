# After Liberal Hegemony: The Advent of a Multiplex World Order
## Article Introduction

The first myth - how far the U.S led liberal hegemonic order expanded when in reality, the order was nothing more than US-UK-West Europe-Australasian configuration.

Long-term and structural changes in the global economy - Trump's ascent to power is a consequence of the liberal order. Here goes:

1. Describe the foundations of the liberal order and the ground that it has been built on has been eroding over time
2. The rising powers are not in a position to overturn the current order completely - 'multiple worlds'
3. Scholarly critique and suggestions.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Foundations of the liberal order

The idea of liberal international order rests on four key elements: free trade, post-war multilateral institutions; the growth of democracy; and liberal values.

China's economic growth has behind the expansion of global free trade - global trade has been growing at a meager annual rate of 2 percent. Since 2010, however, global trade has been growing at a meager annual rate of 2 percent and the trade-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has been falling.

This slowdown of the sentiments against globalisation came to the fore in 2016 presidential election. Trump ran on an electoral platform that pledged to withdraw from Trans-Pacific Partnership to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA.

**The second key element of the foundation of the liberal order is the post-war system of multilateral institutions built and maintained by the United States and its allies**. Like trade, this too was already fragmenting long before Trump’s ascension. The large UN-based multilaterals that formed the core of the post-war order are no longer the only game in global governance. **Since the creation of the UN system in the 1940s there has been a proliferation of regional and plurilateral arrangements, private initiatives, and various forms of partnership involving governments, private parties, and civil society actors in such areas as security, climate change, and human rights—many of which were neither the product of U.S. leadership nor beholden to American purpose.** Here again, as with trade, the Trump administration is following a trend already in motion, seeking to further sideline the traditional, long-standing liberal institutions. It has already indicated that the United States will place greater stress on bilateral deals based on a stricter and more direct reciprocity, rather than rely on multilateralism.

The third element of the liberal order is the growth of democracy - after the global democratic revolution known as the Third Wave saw the number of democracies nearly double after the end of the cold war.

The fourth element is liberal values - "represents a hard knock for the West's normative bedrock of liberalism" dented America's soft power, which depends much on the attractive of its domestic politics, culture and institutions. It has also dented America's soft power, domestic politics, culture and institutions.


### The Emerging Powers

"Moreover, the BRICS are not in a position to exploit the crisis in the liberal order through concerted action even if they so desired, as some of them, such as Brazil, South Africa, and Russia, are themselves in considerable economic and political distress." - the GDP growth of the five BRICS nations slowed down from an average 9 percent annually in 2010 to about 4 percent in 2015 ... These economic setbacks will hinder any attempt to formulate some new order. (275)

China and India also suffer from problems of legitimacy and support in their own respective neighbourhoods, further constraining their potential to take a greater role in the world order.

Domestic political problems and dependence on global trade - it would be a mistake to assume that the emerging powers would have the same stake in the liberal order as the West because they have benefited. Without concrete progress in meeting their demand for reform of the existing international institutions ... They still have to co-exist with the West. 


### Multiplexity, Not Multipolarity (276-277)

At least five major differences between pre-war multipolarity and the emerging twenty-first-century world order. 

1. Pre-war multipolarity was largely a world of empires and colonies. The primary actors in world politics were the great powers.
2. The nature of economic interdependence today is denser, consisting of trade, finance, and global production networks and supply chains
3. Contemporary economic interdependence is more global compared to that in the nineteenth
4. There is far greater density of relatively durable international and regional institutions today
5. Challenges to order and stability have become more complex - traditional challenge to world order, interstate conflict has declined since WW 2 and not stands at a negligible level.

The emerging world order is thus not a multipolar world, but a multiplex world. It is a world of multiple modernities, where Western liberal modernity, is only a part of what is on offer.

A multiplex world is not defined by the hegemony of any single nation or idea. This does not necessarily mean the United States is in decline - that US is no longer in a position to create the rules and dominate the institutions of global governance and world order in the manner it had for much of the post-World War II period.

### Crosscutting globalism, not liberal hegemony (277-278)

Globalisation became developed by development concerns. This might give more space to the initiative of the emerging powers, which tend to focus more on infrastructure than on free trade.

Moreover, the new globalization will be anchored more by South-South linkages rather than North-South ones. This is already happening: according to the United Nations Development Programme.

"Due to the prominence of China and other emerging powers, the new globalization might also be more respectful of sovereignty, especially compared to the Western-led globalization during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which has been associated with colonialism and direct and indirect military intervention to secure Western economic and strategic interests (a long list of examples would include the Suez and numerous interventions in Latin America). This is not to say that emerging powers do not use force or violate sovereignty. With its growing overseas investments, China will be tempted to abandon its professed policy of non-interference and to use force or coercion in support of its economic and strategic goals. But in line with the outlooks of the emerging powers, the new globalization is likely to be more economic and less political or ideological (especially compared to the West’s promotion of democracy and human rights)." (278).


### G-PLUS, NOT G-ZERO, GOVERNANCE

Trump's stated policy positions suggest a nationalist, inward-looking U.S. foreign policy: policies on trade and security are undermining global institutions, such as the World Trade Organisation and the United Nations.

Global governance has already already begun accommodating the growing roles of private bodies, civil society groups, and regional arrangement, thus reducing the position of formal intergovernmental organisation. (279)

"The maintenance of world order depends on regional orders ... Developing such inclusive, open regional orders is a critical challenge. This would require creating new regional mechanisms and supporting those that already exist but are constrained by a lack of resources. While some liberal thinkers see regionalism (not including The European Union) as a threat to world order, there are many regional initiatives that, if recognized and strengthened, could actually support world order.  For example, ASEAN+’s Chiang Mai initiative on finance has allowed those countries to better cope with short-term liquidity problems, supplementing the existing capacity of the International Monetary Fund." (279)

"A multiplex world will not be free from disorder, but it is also not necessarily doomed to be what Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini call a G-Zero World." (279)

"A multiplex world is a G-Plus world, featuring established and emerging powers, global and regional institutions and actors, states, social movements, corporations, private foundations, and various kinds of partnerships among them." (280).

### The stability of a multiplex world

There are several things that must be kept in mind:
1. First, stop pining for the return of liberal hegemony, by which I mean the post-World War II world order created and dominated by the United States and centred around Western interests, values and institutions. The global power has shifted.
2. Unless and until the Trump administration radically changes course or is replaced, prepare to live without significant U.S. support for multilateralism.
3. The end of the U.S. hegemony does not equal the "return of anarchy" if anarchy implies the end of global cooperation, as some worry. Progress in global governance was never linear to start with, nor was there ever any consensus that global governance is a good thing. Demand for global governance has and will continue to be varied depending on the issue area.
4. Despite claims of the world being "on fire," there are also many success stories of growth and stability in the world. When it comes to international stability, there is both good and bad news. Some forms of international violence, such as interstate wars, are on a long-term decline.
5. Give due credit to the contribution of non-Western actors to the market-place of ideas for global cooperation.
6. Encourage pragmatic globalism in place of ideologically-charged liberal internationalism, a term that is deeply associated with Western hegemony and hypocrisy
7. Embrace G-Plus global governance. The growing complexity of global governance is inevitable due to the proliferation of a variety of new actors and transnational issue areas. It is impossible for the state-centric bureaucratic institutions crafted in the s to cope with these changes. 
8. Take regional powers and regionalism seriously. Regions are crucial sites for both conflict and cooperation. In considering ways to develop a new world order, one should not focus too much on the big emerging powers while neglecting the role of other regional powers in the developing world, such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey. Not all forms of regionalism are harmful to global cooperation; indeed, they may contribute to it.

"The stability of a multiplex world will require many Western nations to give up their free-riding on the United States and accept shared leadership with the rising and regional powers." (283)
