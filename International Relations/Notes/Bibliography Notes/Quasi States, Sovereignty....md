## A collection of key ideas from the article

### STATES AND QUASI-STATES

Ex-colonial states, whilst enfranchised and possessing the same rights and responsibilities of other sovereign states of juridical statehood, have not been empowered domestically - they lack advantages like political will, institutional authority and organized power to protect human rights.

"The ex-colonial states have been internationally enfranchised and possess the same external rights and responsibilities as all other sovereign states: juridical statehood. At the same time, however, many have not yet been authorized and empowered domestically and consequently lack the institutional features of sovereign states as also defined by classical international law." (21)

These benefits are just limited to the 'elites' - juridical yet not elite. They are referred as 'quasi-states'

State-building is a domestic process occurring over a long period of time that can only be brought about by combined wills, effort and responsibilities of governments and populations.

"One of the defining characteristics of quasi-states is the undertaking of contemporary international society to promote their development - or at least to compenstate them for their current condition of underdevelopment rather like poor citizens in welfare states."


```

Quasi-states enjoy equal sovereignty but lack the institutions capable of constraining and outlasting the individuals who occupy their offices.

In the past, using a [[Hans Morgenthau]] interpretation of realism, state systems had to survive by their own efforts. What has changed is not these empirical conditions, but the international rules and institutions concerning those conditions - weakness or 'backwardness' of countries is not a justification for colonialism.

It is the way that inequality and underdevelopment is conceived that has changed society. States that are ramshackle cannot disappear juridically, deprived of sovereignty or more - "quasi-states are creatures and their elites are beneficiaries of non-competitive international norms." (24)

Political weakness and economic underdevelopment are now considered reasons for exemption from classical international competition between states, and grounds for positive assistance between states. There now is an "existence of an international society that has presided over the birth of numerous marginal entities, guarantees their survival, and seeks at least to compensate them for underdevelopment if not to develop them into substantial independent countries." (24)

This has resulted from new international norms such as anti-colonialism, ex-colonial self-determination and racial sovereignty.

Consequentially, there has emerged a new kind of constitutional mechanism that has largely displaced the military or diplomatic security arrangements of the past. Ex-colonial self-determination has led to a new kind of territorial legitimacy and the freezing of the political map in much of the Third World.

Quasi-states and their external support structures support a new kind of **negative sovereignty** fashioned for the independence of the Third World - a regime that helps make numerous underdeveloped colonies independent.

If balance of power and self-help criteria has been retained, fewer countries would have gained independence and be colonies today. Decolonisation would be postponed.

This new doctrine justified the independence of every colony whilst establishing a different basis of sovereign statehood but it can also make demands on international society for assistance. "Quasi-states are therefore disclosed by a new positive international society which fostered the independence of such states and caters for their survival and development." (24)

In short, quasi-states are creatures of change in the rules of membership and modes of operation of international society which were deliberately made to replace the institutions of European overseas colonialism. The correct level of analysis for understanding these problematic entities is not the state as such but the states-system and particularly its new accommodating norms.

### NEGATIVE SOVEREIGNTY AND POSITIVE SOVEREIGNTY

This is developed by [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s definition of negative and positive liberty.

Negative liberty is the area within that man can act obstructed by others that affords people freedom from interference - interference with such only justified through the harm principle.

Negative sovereignty - freedom from outside interference: (27)
1. legal foundation that a society can rest on
2. Independence and non-intervention as the distinctive and reciprocal rights
3. Differs from negative liberty as it does not have the same benefits - individuals enjoy negative liberty and immunities whereas it cannot be conferred on the population
4. A sovereign government unlike a free individual is Janus-faced - it faces outwards at other states and inwards at its own population, a government can harm their own population with no higher authority to control them

Positive liberty - being one's master, freedom to realize goals and presupposes agencies and conditions that are enabling (29)
1. Substantive rather than formal condition - possesses the wherewithal to provide political goods for its citizens, collaborate with other governments and more
2. The means which enable states to take advantage of their independence indicated by able and responsible rulers
3. A political attribute, not a legal one - the feature of a 'developed' state.

This gap between negative and positive sovereignty is universally perceived by IR today due to new standards and expectations of the society of states concerning the development of its members.

# 2 - A NEW SOVEREIGNTY REGIME (32-49)

## A collection of key ideas from the article

Sovereign statehood is now the only kind of international status that exists today - there are no more colonies, protectorates, mandates, condominia and more.

Constitutional independence differs categorically from physical separation and colonial status is not the same as economic dependency. Sovereign states are legally but not necessarily physically insular.

Today, rulers can acquire independence solely in virtue of being successors of colonial governments: the negative sovereignty of many more or less nominal Third World States.


### THE OLD SOVEREIGNTY GAME

Sovereignty can be understood in terms of a game: activities constituted and regulated by rules. Here, it's important to distinguish between two different types of rules: constitutive (civil) and instrumental (organizational) rules.

Constitutive rules define the game: number of players, size and shape of playing field and so on.
Instrumental rules are precepts, maxims, strategies derived from experience.

The classical sovereignty game is constituted by various laws, practices, customs and prescriptions - foreign policy is among the major instruments used by statesmen, an attribute of states.

The constitutive rules of the sovereignty game are a response to plurality: legal equality of states, mutual recognition, jurisdiction, non-intervention, making and honouring of treaties, diplomacy, international law (paraphrased. 35). In short, the rules include and indeed civilize the relations of state. (35)

The classical sovereignty game exists to order the relation of states and regulate the conflicts to restore peace. The national interest of sovereign states is protection and preservation of their own way of life - if they were to convert another, it must be within rules: excluding crusades, jihads, state sponsored terrorism, global communist revolution and more.

Winning and losing is a limited concept than playing - you can be deprived of independence, broken up, and finality is an ill-suited notion as the game goes on. The constitutive rules of the sovereignty game as well as some of the instrumental calculations acknowledge international plurality.

Disregarding the rules in an effort to win amounts to destroying the game by transforming it into a fight. It is a narrow concept: warfare is not fighting as long as it conforms to the laws and practices of war. The main point is to civilise warfare.

```ad-tldr

In short, international law hitehrto acknowledged two statuses: sovereign states and various formal dependencies. Although the League of Nations began to change the rules of the game, sovereignty and empirical statehood were still roughly aligned in most cases. The second status was eliminated following the second world war by outlawing colonialism and inventing new rules of sovereign statehood for ex-colonies based on a novel doctrine of self-determination. Many colonial entities were thereby transformed legally into states ... some [states] regressed by too rapidly rep[lacing European officials with less experienced indigenous personnel. International society now contained one and only one official class which masked enormous differences and variations in the substance and credibility of statehood around the world.

### A NEW SOVEREIGNTY GAME

The new sovereignty games involves two normative innovations: self-determination of ex-colonies and development entitlements of impoverished nations. These norms reinforce the sovereignty of otherwise weak and vulnerable Third World governments and therefore amount to a kind of sovereignty plus.

Also, the contemporary society of states have articulated a norm of human rights which limits autonomy of sovereigns - resisted by many whose domestic conduct is open to question by human rights organizations. This in turn differentiates states in terms of humanitarianism.

Categorical self-determination of former colonies is the fundamental innovation which established the negative sovereignty regime: a moral imperative in decolonization which underwrites the independence of most Third World states, serving as a bulwark against demands by domestic ethnonational groups.

Ex-colonial self-determination established the categorical right to independence of colonial populations and the inviolability of existing ex-colonial territories. It is the negative right of ex-European colonies.

Numerous peoples have been barred from entering the international community: Ewes, Gandans, Karen, Katchin, Kurds, Sikhs and more, often termed as 'separatists', 'secessionists' or 'irredentists.'

New statement have been united to bar ethnonationalities from the club as it would result in a loss of jurisdiction over the territories in question and remaking of international frontiers. Additionally, if they were admitted, "most existing Third World states would crumble into far smaller particularisms." (42). It's important to note that these states may be more coherent domestically but it would fragment existing international society.


```ad-quote

The major difference between the new rules and the old, therefore, is that they apply to many political entites which would not have met the traditional tests of empirical statehood and probably would not exist as sovereign states otherwise.
```

The positive entitlements of sovereign states, stemming from their underdevelopment allows them to acquire assistance from the international community - subsistence rights.

Thereby, "international development is an extension of self-determination from the negative or political to the positive or socioeconomic realm" - not just freedom from non-intervention but also entitlement, international financial and technical assistance. (43)

At the same time, classical negative rights are in play - underdeveloped states claim both security and development rights, but are in the rules of the state system. They  (bearers of rights) have no obligation to use foreign aid as needed, and they (holders of obligations) have no right to demand it.

Additionally - the cosmopolitan regime that seeks to establish the legal status of humans in international relations, human rights organisations that reflect our attitudes towards them today.

It is misleading to equate the two categories but international law does do so, telling us more about international politics than human rights - only civil and political liberties are 'human rights' so called acknowledged by international law. Socioeconomic rights require more than just human conduct as the aforementioned does - rather, they are 'needs', positive rights and components of the international development regime.

## A NOVEL INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK (important!

Third World independence has created two games of sovereignty: 'hardball' based on positive sovereignty and a softer game derived from negative sovereignty.

Hardball:
- See the East-West military contest

Softball:
- North-South 'dialogue' that is the successor of Western colonialism.

What changed is the moral and legal framework of the states system and the ways that underdeveloped parts of the world are supported externally.

Finally, in response to the civil conditions of many countries around the world, the community of states is attempting to establish to establish international standards of human rights that sovereign governments are urged to observe.
