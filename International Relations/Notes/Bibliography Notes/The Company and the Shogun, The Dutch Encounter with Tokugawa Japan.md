## INTRODUCTION: TAMING THE DUTCH

(Page 1)

In October 1627, a grand embassy arrived in Edo, the Tokugawa government's political capital sent by the Dutch East India Company.

In the palanquin was Pieter Nuyts, recent graduate from Leiden Uni, councillor of the Indies and now ambassador to the shogun of Japan, followed by a retinue of 300 of Dutch soldiers, samurai, pages, translators.

One month later, Nuyts tried to flee Edo in the middle of night with his embassy rejected without ever seeing the shogun. No retinue gathered to accompany the ambassador on his journey. They were halted by a cry, and was later executed.

Many European representatives in Asia found themselves in a similar position. These individuals occupied a precarious position on the frontline of the global encounter between Europe and Asia that commenced in 1497 when Vasco da Gama's small fleet opened trade routes to India.

Then, tens of thousands of Europeans, first the Portuguese, then the Spanish, Dutch and English moved into Asian waters, meeting states equipped with more military, economic and cultural resources.

This study focuses on an encounter between the Europeans and the Asian state - the interaction between the Dutch East India Company and the Tokugawa regime which held the Japanese archipelago.

What was the nature and extent of European power in early modern Asia?

How did Europeans manage their encounters with Asian states like Tokugawa Japan?

What place did they find in local political orders?

How does an examination of the politics of encounter alter our understanding of what has been termed 'the rise of Europe?'

## THE GREAT DIVERGENCE

Da Gama was not the only mariner.
Five years before his departure, another expedition dispatched by Portugal's neighbour Spain and placed under Christopher Columbus left European shores in search of India.

These fleets met disparate civilisations, headed off in opposite directions.

Europeans traveling west were able to conquer empires; subjugate people, cultures, and territory, transforming the socio-political landscape.

The first of Columbus's declarations took place on the 12th October 1492 after a voyage of 33 days, when the admiral stepped onto the island of Guanahani carrying a royal flag, wherein Columbus took 'possession of the island for the King and for the Queen ... making the declarations that are required'.

Over the next decades, these ceremonies of possession were replicated, laying the basis for an empire that stretched first along the coasts before pushing steadily inland. This pace of expansion is attributed to two key advantages:

(page 4)

Historians focused on technology: iron weapons and firearms, and steel armour. Just a few decades after the encounter on Guanahani, Hernan Cortes famously brought down the Aztec empire with only 2000 Spanish troops. His achievement was matched by a smaller contingent of 167 soldiers under the command of Francisco Pizarro that marched into Central America.

These tools of war, paved with confidence, enabled Europeans to view the New World as a blank page, leading to small, outnumbered groups of adventurers to lay claim to land.

In recent decades, this triumphant narrative has been silenced with an understanding of the consequences of the Columbian experience. The basic outlines of the confident European have unchanged - while expansion westward with its dramatic stories of conquest and subjugation occupies a central place in scholarship, less attention has been paid to how Europeans fared in Asia and how they dealt with the states they found there.

Historians searching for evidence of European strength have turned to a familiar pairing. One group argued that military technology (the gunned ship) transformed Asian politics.

(page 5)

Others have looked at cultural assumptions suggesting that disparate encounters were underpinned by basic confidence that enabled Europeans to silence Asian interlocuters.

This is Edward Said's study of orientalism with may studies coming to take the idea of the confident European secure in the knowledge of his own superiority as their most basic premise, aiming to unpick the internal logic of  orientalist discourse. One figure to receive attention was Thomas Roe, an English ambassador sent to India whose diaries provides evidence of the ''colonizing imagination'' (Jyotsna Singh).

But this idea of the Europeans destroying the Asians is not correct.

The argument that this cannot be strung into a pattern has been recognized by a group of scholars argued against what Tonio Andrade, a leading representative of this revisionist approach calls the "1492 Schema" of history that seeks to equate the voyages of exploration with "the rise of teh west".''

(page 6)

Historians like Kenneth Swope, Peter Lorge and Sun Laichen argued against the focus on European tech by pointing to the existence of an Asian military revolution that paralleled developments in Europe.

Scholars like Leonard Blusse and Tonio Andrade himself have demonstrated the Asian roots of European success, showing in places like Taiwan or Batavia, a thin overlay of European structures served to conceal a far more substantial Asian base while William Thompson and G. V. Scammell focused on the role played by local allies in facilitating European expansion. They have been joined by economic historians who mount an attack on the "1492 Schema", with scholars like Kenneth Pomeranz, R. Bin Wong, Andre Gunder Frank and others arguing that the time line of European ascendancy should be pushed back beyond 1800.

Across the region the more common narrative was that of containment, that even weapons can be stripped away from them. These Europeans were forced to rely on negotiation, petition and appeal to carve out a limited space for their operations.

The key variable responsible for triggering an immediate divergence from the Columbian experience was the presence of Asian states, forming political actors used to dealing with foreigners and resisting their demands - from the moment of first contact, when his expedition arrived in the port of Calicut. Unable to bend the ruler of Calicut to his will, the Portuguese explorer was forced into the position of supplicant, appearing in court armed with diplomatic letters than markers of possession, eager to negotiate.

(page 7)

It's equivalent (the expansion dispatched to the sovereign) between the acts highlight the divergent nature of the European experience: while da Gama approached Calicut with caution, its ruler was a minor potentate with no great influence. Whereas, Europeans thrust into contact with states like Ming China, Mughal India and Tokugawa Japan filled politics with trepidation.

If we want to see a representative to stand in for European expansion, we could look at Jonathan Swift's mariner Lemuel Gulliver who runs into a succession of states and rulers. Each time, he is left impotent and uncertain - in the kingdom of Lilliput, Swift's hero stumbles upon a realm populated by inhabitants less than one tenth his stature, and forced to render military service and to prostrate himself before the monarch.

On the island of Brobdingnag, Gulliver finds himself in a society of giants threatened by tiny creatures. He is forced to become a plaything, and faced by the Houyhnhnms, an intelligent horse-like species, he loses all faith in European civilization.

(page 8)

He is stripped of power, forced to adapt, transformed.

This is a similar pattern of many European agents in Asia who find themselves trapped in strange lands.

```ad-question
title: Two questions to help us understand them:
collapse: open
First, what was the nature of the encounter between European enterprises and Asian states?
The second question revolves around the nature of the European response and its focus on adaptation.
```

Two models of providing a framework to consider interaction have emerged: arguing against notions of a unitary "Vasco da Gama epoch" of European hegemony. Both emphasize the limited nature of European incursion into Asia but in different ways.

Holden Furber described the early modern period as an "age of partnership" in which close bonds developed between Europeans their Asian interlocuters. This span was characterized by cooperation "than by assertations of power and hostility". The result was to treat Europe's push into Asia an extended conflict-free learning process during which both sides drew closer to each other.

(page 9)

Some scholars have criticized Furber's work for offering a rosy view of relations characterized by mutual understanding and shared structure.

In 1990, Sanjay Subrahmanyam challenged this notion by highlighting the violence of the period and the conflicts that took place. His work described it as an "age of contained conflict" where there was "trials of strength, mutual probing for chinks in the armour, and repeated localized conflicts."

This model best suits an analysis around individual conflicts. This is a sort of learning process, where accommodation was reached often as the weaker side retreated. This emphasises how Asian states either adapted to take a placed in a Western-dominated world or succumbed to a colonial embrace.

(page 10)

This later period was, in the final assessment, brief - the result of work by Pomeranz and other historians has been to show that Asian states were far more powerful than imagined, revealing the limitations of European dominance.
