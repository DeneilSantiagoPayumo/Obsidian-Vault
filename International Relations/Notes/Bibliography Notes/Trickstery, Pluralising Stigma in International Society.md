Xymena Kurowska and Anatoly Reshetnikov, “Trickstery: Pluralising Stigma in International Society.” European Journal of International Relations, 2021 27 (1): 232-257.

# Key points from introduction:
- International politics imagined as a binary opposition between the oppressor and the oppressed
- This obfuscates the mechanisms of power that must be understood in order to grasp these hierarchies
- Mechanisms in the practice of trickstery, perceived in the context of Russia's ambivalent place in international society - stigmatisation is a plural phenomenon, giving rise to various challenges.
- Unsettles liberal sphere through its performance of emancipatory and anti-emancipatory logics
- Undecidable situation that exceed analytical capacities of norms, stigma management ... Especially employed in the international situation with Russia.
- Overidentification with norms

## Introduction

Trickstery has two important interpretations - on the one hand, Russia's deviancy in international society, and the 'subaltern empire' that cultivates a sense of its victimhood by the West.

Both oppressor and marginalised we can find here: 'professional confusion'. Plural subjects that perform stigmatised and stigmatising simultaneously.

It is a heterogenous figuration that remains intelligible across cultural contexts - complex configuration.

Russia as trickster in international society - examines conditions of trickstery and methodological visibility, distinguishes overidentification with norms as contextual mechanism of trickstery and trademark of Russia's diplomacy.

## Russia as trickster?

Ambiguous liminal position - both 'part of' and 'apart from' Europe.
Stigmatisation is what makes the world hang together and understand how norms work.

Russia's incorporation into the Westphalian system comes with the stigma of accepting a 'self-negating position of an outsider', transition towards full membership, systemic ambivalence resulting from not being able to achieve such status.

Stigmatised actor may exploit stigma as a way of gaining influence - performative rationality problematises the strategy of stigma exploitation, dramatic effect of satirising the stigma.

Two conditions - liminal situations as a form of test and 'a theatricalization of the social' - liminal spaces to 'stage his transgressive "theatre"'.

There is not one trickster language.

Russia's justification of its veto against the Security Council resolutions condoning the Syrian regime - moral ambivalence. Indignation with artistic flair. Unconditional support for the regime of non-proliferation of WMD, the commitment to protect peace and security, accuse Western experts of partiality and politicisation, questioning its legitimacy.

Promote itself as the proper guardians of international law - a dual strategy of obstruction and diversion.

Un general assembly - international law applies in cyberspace, joint report, rift between the West and 'the rest'.

Russia-sponsored resolution: provisions of UN charter, open-ended working group (participation of UN membership in decision making), recorded drafts.

"Not an unheard of diplomatic manoeuvre, the move draws its effect from a particular constellation of international society wherein Russia acts as, simultaneously, a ‘cultural hero’ levelling hierarchies on behalf of the marginalised in the cyberspace and a ‘selfish buffoon’ that blurs the very sense of distinction between truth and lies. It thus escalates divisions, for the instrumental gain of undermining legitimacy of the process that Russia cannot control anymore, and for the ‘theatre of it’. Theatricalisation is intrinsic to usurping the role of a saviour that is half-interested in solving the crisis. The moral ambiguity and flexibility of the trickster is on display. Russia’s declared mission of curbing Western hegemony both addresses and exploits genuine inequality in international society, as liminality is also a source of potentially emancipatory reshufflings."

## Conclusion

Dialectic of dissent by the stigmatised, a reproduction of oppression by the stigmatising - allure of disorientating and/or reorientating plural figures, normatively hazardous as it appeals to both those who 'wish to resist hegemonic relations of power and those who wish to sustain them'.

What political forms? By magnifying the flux, anguish and confusion form the currency of international interactions.

Russia as a trickster? Perhaps - unrepresentativeness of global arrangements it had co-constituted. Credibility on others and good faith diminished.
