The priority attached to European imperialism has meant that the history of cross-cultural exchange has been commonly approached in terms of the forcible imposition of European preferences and agenda, European actors taking advantage of their dominant ideological and material resources to coerce their weaker counterparts.

Patterns of cross-cultural exchange between Europeans and peoples in other parts of the world have been defined by forms of negotiation, limitation and adaptation, rather than unilateral European imposition. Europeans find it difficult in many settings to impose their preferences upon their counterparts elsewhere and were obliged to develop alternative means of transferring items and ideas across cultural and political divides.

All parties, although not equally, benefitted from this.

A large portion of these links were based on slave trading.

139

In five sections, in the first section we reflect on the relative neglect of pre-colonial Atlantic Africa, then other approaches within the social sciences - that many of the exchanges in Atlantic Africa has been overlooked. In section three, we examine main cultural, political and economic attributes of Atlantic Africa. In section four we look at the early history of cross-cultural exchanges between Europeans and Atlantic Africa. One of the key themes is the disjunction between the individual gains accrued to both European and African slave traders. Finally we review a number of cross-cultural institutions and influences that characterized European dealings in Atlantic Africa. Transatlantic slavery would not have persisted without a series of cross-cultural institutional arrangements that helped standardise this trade.

For time purposes we have skipped section one and two.

## Atlantic Africa and Slavery

Atlantic Africa here refers to coastal regions and associated hinterlands that were integrated into the Atlantic world at various points from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries onwards.

Since slavery became central to patterns of cross-cultural exchanges, these boundaries were chiefly determined by which areas consistently participated in maritime slave trading. Deep-water vessels did not play a major role so the arrival of ships capable of navigating the Atlantic Ocean initiated all kinds of political, cultural and economic adjustments.

Based upon the evidence currently available it is clear that Atlantic Africa was far from being a homogenous region. According to John Thornton, it is possible to locate about 150 sovereign polities.

While it is true that cross-cultural socialization was generally fairly limited, the language of an international system is not ideal here. What was at issue was the development of institutions and agreements for regulating the movement of ideas and items across cultural divides, the language of an international system is not ideal here - what was at issue was the development of institutions and agreements for regulating and facilitating the movement of ideas and items across cultural divides.

Military and diplomatic calculations were integrated into an overarching system.

146

Both geographic and demographic considerations played a huge role in structuring patterns of settlement, trade, warfare and social organization. First, it is important to underscore the general point that the regional distribution of rivers, rainforests, savannah, access to trading and more played an important role in shaping relationships both amongst Africans and between Africans and Europeans. Rivers proved efficient vehicles for trade but in their absence overland travel proved challenging and time consuming. The impact of horces were complicated by disease and inhospitable terrain.

Herbst's work in [[States and Power in Africa, Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control]] provides the basis for a second observation regarding the complementary role of demographic factors - many parts of Atlantic Africa had low population densities, contributed to an environment where labour was few. Since land was abundant, control over people prospered and slavery rose.


147

As a general rule, control over people rested upon complex forms of dependency and patronage, with junior members providing services, support and material goods for their superiors while their superiors in turn offered their qualified patronage. In this hierarchy, problematic individuals could be disciplined in various ways.

One of the main arguments of slavery in Atlantic Africa was natal alienation, which refers to the status of slaves as 'kinless' outsiders whose lack of kinship ties put them at the bottom of the hierarchy.

Many slaves then ended up in local slave markets.

## Early European incursions and the Portuguese in Angola

Europeans rarely succeeded in establishing colonial settlements until after 1850s. This pattern of interaction with Atlantic Africa can be contrasted with developments in Americas - by 1550s Spanish and Portuguese invaders established major bridgeheads in the Americas. A century later, large portions of the Americas were under European rule.

Europeans in Africa remained confined to a series of modest forts and substantial Portuguese settlement at Luanda.

148

Portuguese agents were the first Europeans to make contact with local people among the Atlantic coast, and they represented the only European state to establish a major African colonial settlement before. Commercial motives played a central role from the outset. Starting with the canary islands Portuguese vessels moved south along the coast, reaching Sierra Leone in 1460 ... sugar-producing colonies on the islands of Sao Tome and Principe, and later Angola.

They were violent but these efforts provoked strong resistance.

In addition, they sent and received a significant number of diplomatic envoys.

149

During this period, the rulers of Kongo governed as many as 350,000 people paying taxes. Contact between Kongo and Portugal began in 1483 with the arrival of a small fleet led by Diogo Cao, prompting exchanges that saw envoys travel to Portugal.

These exchanges resulted in Atlantic Creoles - a cultural form represented by profession of Christianity, knowledge of European languages and political ideas and so on.

There is no question that these cross-cultural exchanges resulted in the emergence of novel identities and social formations. One of the issues at stake is the extent to which classifying those involved as African Christians unduly privileges European referents and overlooks the centrality of local forms of community and cosmology.

150

This is not to say that religious convictions were not always genuine but it appears that the terms on which Christian doctrines were conceptualized and operationalized owed a large debt.

It is clear that these new cultural influences were mediated by larger political and economic considerations. Slave trading proved incredibly important in this context since gold and spices found in other parts of Atlantic Africa were not locally available in Angola. From the onset, warfare and slave trading were inextricably linked. 

This is the transformation - demand for slaves provided a catalyst for increasingly organized violence. This created a volatile environment which the Portuguese were eventually able to exploit their advantage using a complex series of alliances and collaborations.

Portuguese agents first moved towards establishing a colonial settlement at Luanda in the 1570s. Kongo was overrun from the east by Imbangala invaders. This exposed the weakness of Kongo and its reliance on Portuguese support while also revealing the vulnerability of Portuguese traders and settlers in the region.

Drawing upon his experience in the region, Novais launched his colonial venture at Luanda which was to the south of Kongo - 2340 Ports arrived but sickness meant that only 300 survived which was taken over.

151

The Ports retreated and secured new allies. They expanded their territorial rule and their larger sphere of political and economic influences over the course of the sixteenth century and beyond. The process was facilitated by internal fragmentation and took place in context of constant warfare.

The political economy of Atlantic slavery introduced a series of incentives that allowed the Ports to recruit allies in Africa - it could not have taken place without sustained levels of African participation as trading partners.

Both the terms of these exchanges and composition of Atlantic trading network are considered in more detail.

It's important to recognize the role played by personal interests, collective identities and the importance of short and medium term calculations in shaping decision making. We can make sense of the consequences of transatlantic slavery in Atlantic Africa.

It's important to keep in mind that the terms Africa and African and the perception that Africa is a unified cultural unit are European in origin - enslavers and enslaved shared a common African origin was overshadowed by the fact they came from different communities or ethnic backgrounds.

### Cross-cultural institutions and arrangements in Atlantic Africa

We are concerned with African agency in shaping the context and conduct of trade, and Euro-African institutions and arrangements that facilitated movements across cultural and political lines.

Europeans were able to establish long-term trading relationships in many parts of atlantic Africa. As the scale grew, slave trading acquired a dominant position in many countries.

153

They traded slaves, gold, ivory and more.

Traders were obliged to offer tributes and pay taxes to elites. The precise content of these conventions reflected a combination of geographic and political considerations.

Most settlements operated under varying degrees of local sufferance - separate fortifications and so on.

154

Long term trade took place in the absence of shared cultural values.

In a number of cases, slave trading was conducted via local rulers who focused on taxes and tribute. Many communities of traders expanded within coastal settlements - intermediaries or middlemen. Traders were bound together by a common identity or kinship with social outsiders being confined to subsidiary.

The fortunes were closely connected to the growth for Atlantic trade - slave trading represented a key vehicle for increasing political power and economic wealth, both personal and communal. It was also a matter of communities that pre-dated European contact undergoing long-term transformation.

These arrangements extended to Euro-African relationships. An important ingredient allowing local wealth to grow was the trade credit that many slave dealers received - the most common model involved European providing trade goods that would be exchanged for slaves.

This was a system of deferred payment wherein Europeans advanced goods in the expectation of being appropriately compensated later. These transactions were supported by mechanisms designed to ensure repayment - pawnship was a widespread African mechanism for securing credit that predated the transatlantic slave trade to the Americas.

Pawnship involved individuals being placed with creditors as collateral. When they later returned the pawns were redeemed but if African traders failed to live up, pawns became slaves.

The vast majority of transactions ultimately came to be negotiated in coastal currencies such as the bar, trade ounces, coppers. It provided a mutually intelligible framework for cross-cultural trade.

156

In addition to adhering to local institutions, European traders had to satisfy local preferences for imported trade goods. It has been argued that Europeans duped Africans. That said, consumers in Africa were actually discerning and their preferences had to be accommodated: this was reflected in bundles or assortments of goods that Europeans had to supply if they wanted to compete in buying slaves.

By the height of the transatlantic slave trade during the 18th century, the terms of trade in Atlantic Africa moved against Europeans and in favour of African slave suppliers yet the Europeans continued to participate due to the value of slaves in the Americas.

Other currencies: alcohol, textiles, weapons and metal ware. Imported trade goods were widely disseminated in African markets. Atlantic imports displaced local products but the common scenario involved Europeans supplying said goods to those already available in local markets and interior trading networks.

157

This shows trade was negotiated and that if not beneficial to Africans, long-term trade would not have existed. Europeans found their movements limited and regulated, their didrect cultural influence muted. 

### Concluding Remarks

Europeans inflicted horrific abuse upon Africans. These aren't isolated incidents but need to be understood in terms of systematic exploitation, discrimination, severe abuse and premature death: European policies based on ignorance and arrogance impact us today.

This does not mean that all historical relations between Europeans and Africans are like this.

Angola was built on high levels of local collaboration and cooperation.

158

It becomes clear that the conduct and content of trade were based on complex negotiations and adaptations - slave trading represented a valuable means of economic and political advancement for traders and rulers.

This led to the emergence of cross-cultural institutions that regularized Atlantic slave trading through the provision of credit, enforcement of contracts, expansion of African trading communities, standardization of cross-cultural currencies, establishments of protocols and more.

These arrangements are not unique - a historical pattern of international order.
