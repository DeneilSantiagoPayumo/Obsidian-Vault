# Making the State

102

War helps build the institutional basis of the modern state by requiring a degree of organization and efficiency that only new political structures could provide: states make wars and wars make states.

Wars make the territorial consolidation of a state more feasible and imperative. Only those states that could wield great armies and guarantee control over their territories could play the great game. Only those states able to impose central control could survive the military revolution.

The key to this relationship between war and state making is what Finer calls the "extraction-coercion" cycle as we need capital for war, states penetrating their societies in complex forms to obtain capital. The new post-Westphalian state was suited to the task of this penetration. Resources were built to accommodate this.

Taxes are the best measure of effective political authority and institutional development.

Wars are a potential stimulus for state growth - wars can only make states if they are preceded by a modicum of political organization. Without institutional cohesion, wars create chaos and defeat - only providing an opportunity for organisations able to capitalize on them, unable to make institutions out of thin air.

The capacity of a state to extract resources will be closely linked to the willingness of the population to accept these burdens. Reluctance is not worth the effort. State capacity is a relational phenomenon.

War makes states when there's a union between a dominant institution and a social class that sees it as the best means to defend privilege.


This chapter will analyse the contribution of war to the empowerment of the nineteenth-century Latin American state - tracing the development to the presence of a unified elite. Europe can enjoy conditions that transform bloodshed into modern political institutions.


## War and the Latin American State 108

The most critical aspect of a modern state is often called its ability to form a protection racket: in exchange for obedience, the state will provide protection from violence.

### Providing protection

The state must defend frontiers.

Internal aspect:
1. Only state officials have means to violence
2. The central state institutions have priority over any regional or local competitors.

The first controls lawless violence.
The second is about the number of government inside the territory who are claiming the duty to stamp violence.

The first is pacification and the second is centralization.

Paraguay: a typical unifying war, but difficult: it was this success rather than the War of the Triple Alliance that killed autonomy. The development of national institutions from war helped them.

By 1811, the porteno threat and the possibility of the Brazilian intervention forced the local elite to unite behind a single program and junta.

Chile: it is said that the war against the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was accompanied by efforts to create a central authority. But... not really? The confederation was already made, and the 'disappearance of political parties' had to do with geography and elite interaction.

Overall, infrastructure and political development is related more to the expansion of primary export economy than the logistical needs of war. Even during its most bloody moments, the state was struggling to establish its authority.

Wars seemed to only highlight the intrinsic weakness of the regime and the fragility of any sense of nationhood.

## Collecting Rents

Latin American states were not very successful at collecting the rents derived from the racket if the capacity to protect was weakened and not influenced by war.

Among winners, war lead to an increase in the size of government - wars provided the expected economic stimulus. Military procurement and high war tariffs encouraged domestic industrial development.

Latin American states did not penetrate or extract from their societies in the expected manner: neither Latin American state could extract even half the revenue per capita available to the British state. Also, they were way too dependent on customs revenue than the UK or France. This reflected connections to the global economy, not a stronger state.

The state grew but did not develop the fiscal musculature associated with the warring state: the stimulus of war did not produce the dramatic increase in the institutional complexity of extraction associated with the theoretical model. War produced deficits but was not responded to with increased extraction. Taxes on wealth and production contributed less than 4 percent of ordinary revenue.

An exception: Bolivia maintained oppressive Indian tribute and relied on these sources. Two aspects. First, it was not sensitive to the stimulus as it reflect internal caste divisions. Second, the tax relied on the retention of special social privileges and localized fiefdom.

Another exception: because of its location and threat to existence as well as ideological proclivities, Paraguay could not rely on external finance - it had to live on its own resources.

The state remained largely in charge of external trade. Unlike other Latin American countries, they had a trade surplus, depending on foreign trade for 40% of its government revenue.

Paraguay auto-financed its war.

Even here, the infrastructure was developed independent of interstate conflict. Latin American states can't escape the levies, bankruptcies and mutinies that characterized warring states: they are not built by war.

## Wrong Kind of Wars? 127

In many of the European cases, war contributes to state formation as a direct result of consequence.

Two most obvious examples here are the Italian and German cases - unifications involved not a central authority systematically expanding control over provinces but a regional contender for supremacy defeating all other claimants.

## Conclusions: How Context Matters 163

War did not make states in Latin America, the best that states could do was to survive wars or gain enough of their neighbours' territory to finance expansion - military action did not generate the kind of societal penetration seen in Europe. Latin America was caught in an inertial equilibrium: no class was powerful enough to impose its domination.

The question becomes why these (social, racial and geographical barriers) were particularly acute on the continent. Europe divided elites, regional landscapes and ethnic and class divisions. Why are these more powerful?

The differences in societal contexts were more important.

First, regionalism in Latin America was encouraged by an important natural ally. The physical geography of the continent presented logistical and administrative obstacles only replicated in some parts of Europe. Communication was difficult so authority in Latin America should be compared with empires than nation-states.

The US suffered geographical challenges, therein the territory expanded much more in line with the capacity of the central state to administer. In Latin America, political institution suited for a city-state were given empires to rule. We should not be surprised they failed to do so.

The cultural homogeneity of the continent supported regionalism: the natural centrifugal attraction of the nation-state appeared less obvious. Thus, Latin American countries faced natural obstacles while not enjoying the intrinsic attraction of differentiated pockets of cultural cohesion.

Ethnic divisions were supported by a legal and social system that institutionalized the minutest differences - once again, the model is Austria Hungary where internal ethnic divisions overpowered shared legacy. The presence of significant ethnic divisions  and their legal recognition.

Finally, few elites could be unruly as the European aristocracy - could the Peruvian elites claim to be more factitious than French counterparts? One difference was the European association of elite status with military prowess: this relationship established a close link between marital competition and the viability of any elite group. The control of violence was intrinsic in Europe. In Latin America, political power was secondary to economic control and this made the necessity to construct a state less urgent. Also, the institution of monarchy which gave one family a development of political capacity.

In both states, there was violence. The various regions of Europe re-created a political map. Ethnicities clashed but not hard to disentangle. With limited exceptions, Latin America did not possess the institutional or social kernel. Where local conditions more closely approximated the European cases, war did provide the cement to secure the development of powerful states.

This combo of weak central power and external economic direction is the defining characteristic of postcolonial states. The delegitimization of political authority, fragility of coalition and lack of national cohesion characterised experiences of independent countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

Several special conditions allow wars to make states:
1. Pressure on the state to respond to the financial challenge of war through domestic extraction
2. Enough of an administrative core must be in place that the state can use as a base on which to develop its strength
3. No political body can amass enough authority to coerce and extract without social allies

The central lesson from Latin America is that we cannot assume a state exists because the symbols of independence are there. Without such a driver, wars do not present opportunities for growth or direction. A fiscal system needs constitutional power as well as a bureaucracy to enforce them.

# Making the Nation

167

The events of the past decade have demonstrated that earlier report of the death of nationalism were clearly exaggerated.

The conception and gestation of nations is still confusing.

How to explain the Latin America anomaly? First, the content or iconographic vocabulary of the Latin American state's nationalist myth. Second, what kind of instruments or grammar are used? Finally, what do the media and messages tell us about the relationship between this state and society.

The author makes clear how much state-centred and state-created nationalism relies on history and shared experiences. Traditions are invented but never completely. Nationalism is situationally grounded. States are embedded in the societies from which they rise.

The political appeal of war and its role in the development of nation building may be witnessed - much of Paraguayan identity is based on the country's fate in two wars.

Wars did not make nations in Latin America:
First, there was not many wars suited for the task and they came at the wrong time
The class and caste divisions that helped define Latin America made the use of the symbols that did exist problematic
Many of the states were reluctant to create national pantheons that contradicted the orientation of the elite.

I discuss the role of monuments in the construction of national memory.
I describe the general iconographic pattern.
I offer an explanation.

What is nationalism in this context? This is associated with nation building and integration. State nationalism is characterized by the domination by a single political institution over a territory containing a population that believes it shares an essential identity - a collective and abstract aspiration whose most concrete expression is the state itself.

First, nationalism is associated with a specific and unitary institution - the nation-state.
Second, it is celebrated through a canon.
Third, the links between co-nationals are often abstract and defined by their shared occupation of a territory.

These attributes serve to distinguish nationalism from patriotism - Patriotism does not have to do with formal political institutions. Patriotism does not imply obedience to a collective will or its institutional representative. Patriotism is a faith; nationalism is a church.

## Conclusion: The Limits of History 209

How can we account for the Latin American pattern of military nationalism?

Nationalist myth reflect historical experience - there has to be some historical narrative available.

Beginning with those who have not used military imagery, for Brazil to construct a national myth from independence would be impossible. While the birth of a nation is celebrated, there are limits to which one can mythologize an external liberation.

At the other extreme, Paraguayan history would make neglecting war almost impossible: the devastation of the Triple Alliance and the success of the Paraguayans in holding off defeat for so long could have produced either veneration or repulsion. Interestingly, it was only following the defeat of the liberals in the 1930s that we see the kind of bellists nationalism arising in Paraguay. Political necessity mattered more than history.

The case of Peru, Bolivia and Chile would indicate that the reverence of a war has little to do: it would be impossible to determine who won based on monumental evidence. The communal experience of shared danger and effort that makes remembrance of war are important. Defeats are recalled because they serve to link the community in a shared suffering. The survival of the nation despite the humiliation of defeat works as well as a celebration of victory.

Argentina claims 'ownership' of the two great heroes: independence was a relatively clean conflict for Argentina, not involving regional and racial divisions.

Mexico's use of military themes comes close to the European pattern: nonelite heroes, the inclusion of civil and international wars and a variety of icons and media. The difference leis in what wars were waged: Mexicans wars were not matters of elites but involved many of the population. These wars could serve as symbols of a nation, because they did involve the nation.

Yet war has a limited role. The critical Mexican myth is how *mestizaje* contributed to a 'cosmic race' - in the progression from Tenoch through Cardenas, the wars distracted the main story. Only two wars are central to Mexican nationalism: the conquest, the seeds of the *mestizaje* and the Revolution when the mestizos assume power over the nation.

This leaves Mexico with an insurmountable political paradox: the enemy might be defeated in the iconography but remains in control. The elite is still Spanish and neither the dreams fo Hidalgo nor those of Emiliano Zapata have been achieved.

This shows the limit to the use of war in constructing a Latin American nationalism - even those historical moments that could contribute lack the requisite symbolic depth. The colonial heritage of Latin America placed limits on what even these symbols could accomplish.

The icon of independence provides the best means to understand the constraints facing Latin American countries: an ambiguity of what exactly the criollos were fighting for. For each instance of San Martin's abolishing legal racial distinctions there is a backlash against the fear of racial uprising. Opposition to the independence cause was found within the frontiers of the new countries.

The second difficulty was that the enemy had disappeared: Spain did not represent a significant threat to Latin America after independence. It represented too unequivocal a victory to be used by the state seeking to create a common identity. In the 20th century, Spain's role was largely taken by the US and it served as basis for the legitimacy of a revolutionary.

A third obstacle is that they were fought by armies from various countries: Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia were given independence by armies consisting of soldiers from the River Plate, Chile and Colombia.

Moreover, these wars left the countries with a common set of images and references that made it hard to demonize a neighbouring enemy: the shared experience was part of a single iconographic family as Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia fly the same flag.

Thus for a political institution interested in creating a sense of identity bounded by territory, the wars of independence represent debilitating challenges - the states had ccreated stronger senses of particular identity than had the Latin American countries.

What does Latin America tell us?

1. Communities cannot be [[Benedict Anderson|imagined]] out of the ether; they require some basis in the past.
2. The historical context in which the Latin American countries achieved independent statehood appears similar to that experienced by the European counterparts: the nineteenth century was the "springtime of nations" on both continents.

This obscures two differences:
First, the ethnic makeup of the population in Latin America was distributed in a very different way from in the European case.
Second, Latin American countries did not undergo the type of military struggles that had been used to construct imagined communities among those of diffuse origins.

These produced limits on the development of nationalist symbols. The first because references to a collectivity were always exclusionary and second because it limits the type of experiences.

Lacking a common ancestor and shared trials, Latin American patriotism remained wedded to concrete places and people and did not develop into the institutionalized worship of an abstract identity that is at the heart of nationalism.

History is not given but re-created through its portrayal. Latin American had a different narrative and different means to tell it. Nationalism made symbols the essence of politics, the aesthetic quality of these could shape politics. Latin America fail to represent national identities - they are elite icons whose hold on the popular imagination may not be strong. Historical traditions could not create a sense of national identities.

This underdevelopment of Latin American national iconographies reflect the needs of the state. There were few threats of war, and thus little need to create a population willing to sacrifice itself. There was little need to integrate since domestic markets were unimportant. No democracy, and no citizens. No war, and no need for nationalism. Without this ideological glue of nationalism, the state developed with limits to its authority.
