Skipped to the conclusion because I'm sick.

The root of the Cold War conflict is based on a clash of social systems as mutual security in these circumstances was a goal that could not be attained.

For the USSR: mutual security is not a goal at all if 'security' is equated with maintaining the status quo. The Soviet view of class conflict as 'socialism in one country' can never be sufficient.

"What remained was the basic premise that history was moving toward Communism and that the Soviet Union had the responsibility to aid its progress." (57)

Desires in the US were instrumental rather than intrinsic - would have gladly frozen the status quo. The US often pursued offensive tactics - "U.S. officials assumed that the competition would continue as long as there was a Communist Soviet Union, and they concluded that the reduction of Soviet influence throughout the world was the only realistic objective." (59)

Despite American military strength, U.S. officials did not believe in the viability of "capitalism in one country" - a stress of vulnerability was a common thread in the American opposition to both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Although neither American interests nor American ideology ruled out indefinite coexistence with a USSR confined to its own sphere, the belief that the USSR was inherently expansionist rendered such an outcome infeasible - "American leaders believed that the instability of world politics precluded a purely defensive posture. The nuclear stalemate meant that demonstrations of resolve were crucial, and the only way to underscore U.S. resolve was by prevailing in crisis. In the Third World, Soviet gains were seen as likely to trigger domino effects, making cooperation there problematic." (60)

Given the conceptions of self interest, not even the best diplomacy could have brought an end to the Cold War - Soviet documents do not indicate a willingness to reciprocate conceivable American peaceful initiatives. American archives assume little basis for assuming that anything short of Moscow's acceptance of the status quo throughout the world would have led to good relations.

Only fundamental changes in the USSR could have ended the cold war.
