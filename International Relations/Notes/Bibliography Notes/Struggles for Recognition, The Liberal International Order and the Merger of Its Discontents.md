Rebecca Adler-Nissen and Ayşe Zarakol, “Struggles for Recognition: The Liberal International Order and the Merger of its Discontents.” International Organization 2021 75 (2): 611-34

## Introduction, key points:
- LIO undermined by voters in the West and states like Russia
- Two strains of recognition struggles against the LIO - one in the core of the West, driven by populist politicians and their voters, and one on the semi-periphery, fuelled by authoritarian government and supporters
- Interconnected in their criticisms of LIO institutions - hollowed out from within.

We once had confidence in the LIO - rationality, democracy, global progress, economic benefits, trade, then moving onto pessimism and concern.

Taken over by populist forces or anti-liberal policy agendas have found support through developments like Brexit.

Putin's imprisonment of opponents, Bolsonaro's targeting of universities, Trump's attacks on immigrants, COVID-19 pandemic, very few enthusiastic defenders.

Is supporting Trump right to explain economic grievances due to unevenly distributed benefits of globalisation, but what about populist policies in Western societies? 

Populist politicians and their cure - cultural ownership, and then anti-liberal governments on the semi-periphery (Western, non-western depends)

Root? Dissatisfaction with it as a recognition order - perceived positions in recognition hierarchy. Many people view the LIO as a friendlier version of previous Western-centric and hierarchical international orders.

Recognition struggles manifest differently in the core and semi-periphery. The LIO promised to remove social and economic inequalities between the West and the non-West but never managed to achieve equality.

Semi-periphery - perpetuating historical hierarchies, discontented groups blame it for stating aspirations of equality (failing to protect historical hierarchies).

Approach populism! Reason for current predicament found in social hierarchies of modern world politics.

Importance in 'status inconsistency' - even if material achievements creates a rise in international hierarchies, achievement does not guarantee recognition - status inconsistency is very important. LIO is important as it disavows hierarchy in terms of recognition and thus is seen as hypocriticial.

LIO - elite project, public does not have clearly-defined preferences, engage in a range of foreign policy decisions, self-understanding of acquiescent groups.

Anxiety in this recognition - losers, grounded in discontent with politics. 2008 financial crash. Perceived threats to American global dominance, majority-minority America, threaten dominant group status.

Populism - vulnerability and nostalgia, expressed in a form of anti-internationalism rather than left-right politics.

The success of the LIO played an important role - norms of political and economic liberalisation dismantled twentieth century regimes of any ideology, competition - more debates and party platforms on 'debunking' the LIO.

Digital technology, activism (spurred by Russia), collaborations between groups and states (ideologies and party politics), vulnerability through actors formally within the LIO or participating within it. Russia is an 'Other' but cannot be used as such for the West - reaching out to right-wing populist, Russia presents itself as the only defender of Western civilization's white, Christian and conservative values.
## Main points in conclusion:

International - information or hybrid welfare. But that's not the case.
Domestic? Audience costs, ideology. But that's not the case. We must consider transnational ideologies.

The LIO is a recognition order that inevitably produces discontents regardless of absolute gains.

Liminal states and populist Western voters are advocating rather for their own hierarchical visions of international order.
