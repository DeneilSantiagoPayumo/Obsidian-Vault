# The Plot Against American Foreign Policy: Can the Liberal Order Survive?
## Article Introduction

Is the world witnessing the demise of the U.S -led liberal order. It is not how it was supposed to happen. U.S. President Donald Trump's every instinct runs counter to the ideas that have underpinned the postwar international system - trade, alliances, international law, multilateralism, environmental protection, torture and human rights,

In his revisionist narrative, the era of pax Americana - the period in which the US wielded the most power on the world stage - is defined above all by national loss and decline.

Trump's challenge to the liberal order is all the more dangerous because it comes with a casual disrespect for the norms and values of liberal democracy itself.

One must look long and hard to find any utterances by Trump about the virtues of the nation's political traditions, the genius of the Founding Fathers, or the great struggles and accomplishments of liberal democracy. 

The profundity of this political movement is greater still because it occurs amid a wider crisis across the liberal democratic world. The centrist and progressive governing coalitions that built the postwar order have weakened. Liberal democracy itself appears fragile, vulnerable in particular to far-right populism. (3)

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Don't Know What You Got

Trump's dark narrative of national decline ignores the great American accomplishment of the twentieth century: the building of the liberal international order. Constructed in the years following World War II, the order is complex and sprawling, organized around economic openness, multilateral institutions, security cooperation, democratic solidarity, internationalist ideals.

"For decades, the US has served as the system's first citizen, providing leadership and public goods - anchoring the alliances, stabilizing the world economy, fostering cooperation, and liberal democracy." (3)

"But in terms of wealth creation, the provision of physical security and economic stability, and the promotion of human rights and political protections, no other international order in history comes close. The liberal order may have Its shortcomings- costly and ill-advised wars have been fought in its name, " (3)

"As the most powerful state in the system, the United States has agreed to restrain itself and operate within an array of regional and global institutions. In 1945, at the meeting in San Francisco that established the UN, president Harry Truman declared, "We all have to recognize, no matter how great our strength, that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please." The United States became, in effect, a User-friendly superpower. Its power was loosely institutionalized, making it more predictable and approachable. The country may spend more on security than its partners, but they host and subsidize U.S. forces and offer political solidarity. Washington receives geopolitical access to Europe and East Asia, where it still wields un-rivaled influence. It gives up. A little of what Trump sees as unused leverage, but in return it gets a better deal: a world of friendly states willing to cooperate." (4)

Trump's transactional view of international relations misses the larger, interdependent logic of the U.S. -led system.

### Dangerous Ideas

Trump's revisionism is dangerous precisely because it attacks the logic that undergirds the United States' global position. The worldview of the president and his base represents a frontal assault on the core convictions of the postwar U.S. global project.

1. Internationalism: the belief that the United States can best advance its economic, political and security - leading the order and engaging deeply with the major regions of the world. Trump does not see this.
2. The second conviction is that Trump rejects is the U.S. commitment to open trade. This responsibility dates back to the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which started the slow process of reopening the world economy after the Great Depression. "Every postwar president has regarded this open system as integral to the prosperity of the United States and to its larger geopolitical goals- until Trump." (5)
3. A third conviction underpinning U.S. Global leadership has been the United States' support for multilateral rules and institutions. This is what has made U.S. Power so unique- and legitimate. After World War II, the United States proceeded to create a global web of institutions and regimes. As a result, other countries realized that they could benefit from U.S. Ascendancy. Global institutions fostered cooperation and allowed Washington to attract allies, making its global presence more acceptable and durable. These institutions helped the international order solve common problems. And when the Cold War ended, no anti-American bloc formed. To the contrary, countries gravitated toward a global liberal internationalist system. (6)
4. Fourth, Trump disdains the multicultural and open character of American society. U.S. power is often denominated In units of GDP and military spending. But American society itself has been a sort of hidden asset. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and its openness has attracted people the world over. Racial, ethnic, and religious diversity makes the U.S. economy more dynamic and countless familial and cultural linkages tie the United States to the rest of the world. Immigrants come to the United states to make their mark, but they do not entirely leave the old world behind, and the resulting networks boost U.S. influence in real, if intangible, ways. This aspect of U.S. leadership is often forgotten, but it becomes visible when threatened, as it is today. (6)
5. Finally, every U.S. president from Woodrow Wilson to Barack Obama has maintained that an enduring community of liberal democracies exists, and that democracies possess a unique capacity to cooperate. During the Cold War, there was an authentic belief- felt in Washington but also in European and Asian capitals- that "the free world" was more than a temporary alliance to defend against the Soviet Union. In 1949, as he introduced the text of the treaty for the proposed Atlantic alliance in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson argued that the world's democracies shared "fundamental" bonds- "the strongest kind of ties, because they are based on moral conviction, on acceptance of the same values in life." Initially, this community comprised only the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, but since the end of the Cold War, it has expanded. (7)


### If Not America

"The defenders of the order should start by reclaiming the master narrative of the last 70 years ... Since the end of the Cold War, over a billion people have been raised out of poverty and hundreds of millions of children have been educate." (8)

"The United States' friends and allies need to make it tough for Trump to pursue an "America first" agenda. They need to show that they are indispensable partners, increasing their military spending and taking the lead on issues such as climate change, nuclear proliferation, trade cooperation, and sustainable development." (8)

"The liberal international order is in crisis for reasons that predate the Trump
Administration. It has lost something critical in the decades since its birth during the Cold War- namely, a shared Sense that a community of liberal democracies exists and that it is made physically safer and economically more secure by staying united. Across the democratic world, the first generation of postwar policymakers and citizens understood that the liberal order provided the political and economic space in which countries could prosper in safety."
