### Single-play Prisoners' Dilemma and the Problem of Collective Action

The difficulties of cooperating is called through "mixed-motive games" characterised by a combination of "mutual dependence and conflict, of partnership and competition" - both players can benefit from mutual cooperation but each can gain more from double-crossing the other one.

Under certain conditions (see the Prisoners' Dilemma), rational actors are unable to reach a pareto-optimum equilibrium.

They warn us against the fallacy of composition which world politics would lead us to believe that the sources of discord must lie in the nature of the actors rather than in their patterns of interaction.

### Limitations of Rational-Choice Models: Choice, Anomie and Ethics

The assumption of rational egoism creates an abstract, unreal world for analysis - it is valuable as a simplifying assumption with which to build theory, since it provides a baseline premised on a relatively rational behaviour, a set of hypothetical expectations that we can then test. Really, this is as [[Max Weber]] says an 'ideal type'.

Their assumptions can be distorted: they assume too easily that actors' decisions are in some sense voluntary, running the risk of ignoring inequalities of power among actors. Secondly, they equate the premise of egoism with an atomic assumption about the role of the individual in society. Finally, rationality may be confused with egoism.

Therefore, we need to be careful in applying rational-choice theory to world politics.

### Choice and Constraint

Using rational-choice theory implies that decisions are voluntary - what if we do voluntary things [[Hobbes, the Leviathan|out of fear?]] .

Distinguish two aspects of the process by which international regimes come into being: imposition of constraints and decision-making.

If we apply rational-choice theory, we must also take into account opportunity costs, constraints, inequality of power and so on. A constraint-choice approach draws attention to the question of why disadvantaged actors join international regimes even though they may receive fewer benefits than other members.

73

### Egoism and Anomie

The danger of rational choice theory - assuming that actors are anomic individuals outside of human society. In a Hobbesian sense, players exist in a state of nature with respect to one another. They are unable to enforce commitments. In a larger sense they are separate from one another, not linked by shared experiences, ethical precepts or expectations of future interactions with identifiable individuals.

Egoist players linked by a common society, with expectations of interaction, may act as if they shared ethical standards. This is not the case.

### Rationality and Ethics

Prisoners Dilemma games may have different payoff matrices if at least one player holds ethical views that value cooperation and censure actions harmful to others.

![[Pasted image 20231102172042.png]]

In this game, Row's dominant strategy is to cooperate and Column's to defect - the outcome ST is a stable equilibrium.

Even Altruism can be considered rational. Theorists forget this.

Rational-choice analysis must consider a prior context of power, expectation, values, and conventions, which affect how interests are determined as well as what calculations, given interests are made.

## Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma and Collective Action in Small Groups

All of these assumptions depend on the idea that the game is played once or at least a small number of times. Obviously, in the long run, the gains of cooperation may be higher than the games of defection. If players engage in the strategy - cooperating then retaliating for defection and reciprocating for acts of cooperation, even among egoists, cooperation can emerge.

Such cooperation need not involve any negotiation - mutual adjustment can take place without direct communication between the participants - but here we focus on bargaining. Negotiations take place simultaneously and into the future.

Contemporary international relations are beset by dilemmas of collective action, but these dilemmas are rendered less intractable by the small number of states involved - not exceeding about 150. In this regard, negotiation barely depend on more than some participants. Institutionalized economic summits involve only seven leaders and the entire Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development only has 24 members of unequal size and influence.

The success of certain large groups relying on a diffuse membership to provide public goods was explained by their provision of private goods as a by-product of membership.

International regimes do the same thing. The benefits provided by international regimes rarely meet the criteria for a public good: impossibility of excluding noncontributors and jointness of supply.

Only members of the IMF can borrow from the fund. The GATT is set up that those who refuse to accept the rules can be excluded. The theory of collective goods is as valuable in explaining the forms that cooperation must take to avoid problems of collective action, accounting for discord.

Rational-choice analysis shows that it can be pursued by purely rational, narrowly self-interested governments, unmoved by idealistic concern for the common good or by ideological commitment to a certain pattern of international relations. Rational egoists can have incentives to form international regimes.

## Egoistic Cooperation and the Creation of International Regimes

A hegemon may create shared interests by providing rewards for cooperation and punishment for defection but where no hegemon exists, similar rewards can be provided if conditions are favourable. Outcomes must be determined by a relatively small number of actors that can monitor each other's compliance.

Intensive action helps in lieu of a hegemon.

Incentives to form international regimes depend on the existence of shared interests - reflecting the gains to be obtained from exploiting others more effectively. They need to be based on a mutual desire to increase the efficiency of the exchanges in which they engage - how dense is the policy space for example.

## Functional Explanations and Theories of Market Failure

Opportunity costs are determined by the nature of the environment as well as by the characteristics of the actor - institutions affect the context of choice and opportunity cost thereof.

Functional explanations account for causes in terms of their effect. Investment is explained by profit.

Functional explanations are post hoc in nature. Rational-choice theory assumes that institutions can be accounted for by examining the incentives facing the actors who created and maintain them. Institutions exist because they can increase the welfare of their creators.

Functional arguments must be used with caution: even if institutions in question perform functions, they may have emerged for different reasons (private property). Functional arguments do not demonstrate that existing institutions had to emerge or that institutions that failed to emerge would have been inferior. Would hypotheticals be better?

Valuable institutions for example don't exist due to this dilemma.

Fortunately, functional analysis does not have to show that a givens et of institutions was uniquely well adapted to the environment in order to make a causal agreement. A sound argument must believe in a connection between the functions an institutions perform and its existence.

One way of avoiding this fallacy is to show that actors being investigated are rational and that institutions were designed to fulfil anticipated functions.

This dilemma may result in market failure. Institutional defects. Innovation may be necessary.

Conclusions

Rational-egoist models do not predict that discord will prevail. People can be excluded, but what matters more is if interactions can continue over time. They may even cooperate and create principles.

Therefore we can criticize Realism's bleak picture of the inevitability of hegemony or conflict. We can become aware of its weaknesses.

# A FUNCTIONAL THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL REGIMES

85

We explore why political market failure occurs and how international regimes can help cover it.

## Political Market Failure and The Coase Theorem

Externalities - actors do not bear the full cost or receive the full benefits of their own actions.

[[Ronald Coase]] argued that the existence of externalities alone does not prevent effective coordination among independent actors - under certain conditions, bargaining could lead to solutions that are Pareto-optimal.

In competitive markets with no transaction costs, an effective decision will be selected on property rights.

```ad-example
title: The Coase theorem
To illustrate the Coase theorem and its counter-intuitive result, sup-pose that soot emitted by a paint factory is deposited by the windonto clothing hanging outdoors in the yard of an old-fashioned laundry. Assume that the damage to the laundry is greater than the $20,000 it would cost the laundry to enclose its yard and install indoor drying equipment; so if no other alternative were available, it would be worth-while for the laundry to take these actions. Assume also, however,that it would cost the paint factory only $10,000 to eliminate its emissions of air pollutants. Social welfare would clearly be enhancedby eliminating the pollution rather than by installing indoor drying equipment, but in the absence of either governmental enforcement or bargaining, the egoistic owner of the paint factory would have no incentive to spend anything to achieve this result. If the laundry had an enforceable legal right to demand compensation, the factory owner would have an incentive to invest $10,000 in pollution control devices to avoid a $20,000 court judg-ment. Coase argued, however, that the pollution would be cleaned up equally efficiently even if the laundry had no such recourse. If the law, or the existence of a decentralized self-help system, gave the factory a right to pollute, the laundry owner could simply pay the factory owner a sum greater than $10,000, but less than $20,000, to install anti-soot equipment. Both parties would agree to some such bargain, since both would benefit.

```

The externality of production would be eliminated - but the difference would be of the distribution of benefits. In a self-help system the laundry would have to pay between 10k and 20k and the factory would reap a profit. If legal liability was based on the polluters pay the laundry would pay nothing and the factory would have to invest ten thousand without financial return.

Essentially, efficient arrangements could be consummated even where the rules of liability favoured producers of externality rather than their victims.

Problems of IR could be overcome through bargaining and mutual adjustment. Essentially, this theory could be taken as minimizing the importance of Olson's logic of collective action or problems of coordination by game theory.

Two reasons why not:
1. Three crucial conditions, legal framework establishing liability. This does not exist in world politics.
2. It has been showed that on the basis of game theory with more than 2 participants this theorem can't be demonstrated, any coalition that forms will be inferior to another. When the core is empty the assumption of zero transaction costs mean that the agreement is hindered rather than facilitated.

Having a clear legal framework establishing property rights and low-cast information will facilitate cooperative solutions. But if transaction costs, no bargains will take place. If they are too low, an infinite series of unstable coalitions will form.

Actors in world politics want regimes as they can make mutually beneficial agreements that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to attain.


### Legal liability

It is impossible to establish international institutions that exercise authority over states - it would be mistaken to regard organizations as unsuccessful attempts to institutionalize centralized authority in world politics.

The lack of a structure does not prevent regimes from developing bits and pieces of law. Regimes establish expectations about other patterns of behaviour, developing working relationships that help parties adapt their practices to new situations.

These arrangements and international regimes are often weak and fragile - rules bent, changed, broken to meet the exigencies of the moment. They are rarely enforced automatically and they are not self-executing.

### Transaction Costs

International regimes alter the relative costs of transaction. Certain agreements are forbidden. Under the GATT it is not permitted to make discriminatory trade arrangements except under specific conditions. Such measures are likely to be costly, retaliation guaranteed.

International regimes affect transaction costs as it makes it easier for government to negotiate agreements. It is more convenient to make agreements within a regime than outside of one.

International regimes allow governments to take advantage of potential economies of scale up to increasing returns to scale.

91

The nesting patterns of international regimes affect transaction costs by making it easier or difficult to link issues and arrange side-payments: clustering of issues under a regime facilitates side-payments among these issues.

If each issue was handled separately from all the others, by a different government bureau in each country - a government must give something up on one dimension to get something on another.

There is bound to be difficulties in coordinating policies of different international organizations in addition to the resistance that will appear to such a move within member governments. Within regimes, side-payments are facilitated by the fact that regimes bring together negotiators to consider sets of issues that lie within the negotiator's bailiwicks at home.

GATT is known for excessive bargaining for side-payments and the politics of issue-linkage.

International regimes therefore affect the costs of transaction. The value of an agreement to its participants depend on how consistent it is with principles of legitimacy embodied in international regimes.

### Uncertainty and Information

The informational functions of regimes are the most important of all - even in games of pure coordination with stable equilibria, the problem of quality uncertainty was the crucial problem in the market for lemons.

Collective action and many situations in general are characterized by conflicts of interest as well as common interests - actors have to worry about being deceived and double-crossed, just as the buyer of a used car has to guard against purchasing a lemon. In the absence of appropriate institutions, some mutually advantageous bargains will not be made because of uncertainty.

### Asymmetrical Information

Some actors know more than others - systematically biased patterns of information. Awareness of this asymmetry is a barrier to information - of current resources, negotiating position but also knowledge of future positions.

People will take advantage of this asymmetry.

Reputation therefore becomes an important asset in persuading others to enter agreements. By reducing asymmetries of information through a process of upgrading the general level of available information, international regimes reduce uncertainty.

Regimes provide information to members, reducing the risks of making agreements. But the information provided by a regime is insufficiently detailed - governments may need precise information, and need to know whether other participants will follow the spirit as well as the letter of agreements.

There may be disadvantages in openness - leaders can't carry out regimes. But there more advantages for governments that will not be duped.

### Moral Hazard

Agreements alter incentives in a way to encourage less cooperative behaviour. Insurance companies face this problem of moral hazard. Look at international banking - the solvency of a major country's largest bank may be essential to its financial system. As a result the central bank may have to intervene if this bank is threatened. This creates a moral hazard since the largest bank have automatic insurance against consequences of risky loans.

### Irresponsibility

Some actors and governments may enter agreements that they won't be able to keep committed.

Irresponsibility is an aspect of the problem of public goods and free-riding, but from the standpoint of the actor, it is a problem of uncertainty - informational costs and symmetries may prevent mutually beneficial agreements.

97

### Regimes and Market Failure

International regimes reduce uncertainty and permit governments to attain objectives that would otherwise be unattainable. They facilitate intergovernmental agreements by raising the anticipated costs of violating others' property rights, altering transaction costs through the clustering of issues and by providing reliable information to members.

Regimes facilitate agreements by raising anticipated costs of violating others' property rights, by altering transaction costs through the clustering of issues and by providing reliable information - they are efficient and create linkage among issues that give actors incentives to reach beneficial agreements.

## Compliance with International Regimes

International regimes are decentralized, but it does mean that any sanctions will have to be enacted by individual members.

The trade and monetary schemes became weaker during the 1970s. American and European policies became more protectionist. Although governments sometime break international rule, they often comply with them.

The puzzle is why governments obey international regimes when they view these rules in conflict with their myopic self-interest - the perception of the relative costs and benefits to them of alternative courses of action with regard to a particular issue. An action is in its self interest if it has the highest expected value of any alternative. 

The governments often comply with rules that conflict with their self-interest poses an anomaly. [[Hans Morgenthau]] believes the national interest wins out over international objective - is the national interest defined myopically, without regard of externalities, or the impact of violating international rules? How are interests defined? How do institutions affect states' definitions of their own interests?

### The Value of Existing Regimes

It is difficult even for perfectly rational individuals to make agreements with one another in the absence of provisions for central enforcement of contracts. In world politics, international regimes help to facilitate the making of agreements by reducing barriers created by high transaction costs and uncertainty.

The importance of transaction costs and uncertainty means that regimes are easier to maintain than they are to create. Once an international regime has been established, it begins to benefit form the high level of information it generates.

Viewing international regimes as both information-providing and transaction cost-reducing entities help us to understand such persistence. They may even lead to trans-governmental networks of friendship, increasing opportunities for cooperation in world politics by providing policymakers with high-quality information about their counterparts.

Appreciating this helps us understand why the erosion of American hegemony during the 1970s was not accompanied by an immediate collapse of cooperation - since there were networks, there was a lag between the decline of hegemony and the disruption of international regimes.

102

International regimes are easier to maintain than construct - rules and institutions will develop in conjunction with them. Even if power becomes diffused, disadvantage may be outweighed by the agreement-facilitating effects of the information provided by the regime.

International regimes embody sunk costs and we can understand why they persist even when all members want different mixtures of principles, rules and institutions.

If regimes were costless so are agreements. It is the costliness of agreements that make them important.

### Network of Issues and Regimes

Regimes make cooperation rational.

```ad-example
title: Nuts 'n bolts:
collapse: open
Suppose, for example, that a member of GATT is under pressure from domestic manufacturers of nuts and bolts to enact import quotas on these products. Even if the government perceives that it has a myopic self-interest in doing so, it knows that such an action in violation of the rules would have negative implications for it on other trade questions—let us say, in opening markets for its semiconductors abroad. The principles and rules of the regime, since they facilitate linkage among issues, will in such circumstances render pursuit ofmyopic self-interest less attractive. Indeed, the prospect of discord asa result of its rule-violation may lead the government to continue to engage in cooperation, whereas if it could have gotten away with the violation without risking discord, it would have gone ahead.

```

Governments may comply with the rules even when the costs of doing so outweigh the benefits. What if they don't provide a benefit?

For a government rationally to break the rules of a regime, the net benefits of doing so must outweigh the net costs of the effects of this action on other international regimes. It may find that it is inhibited from pursuing its myopic interest.

105

In absence of specific retaliation, they have incentive to comply if they believe that their reputations are at stake. They fear that rule-violations will promote rule-violations by others, benefits that create a 'collective bad.'

Reputation is incredibly important, allowing governments to enter advantageous international agreements; tarnishing that reputation as such imposing costs.

## Conclusion

This chapter helps us understand the creation, maintenance and evolution of international regimes - governments calculate their interest on every issue facing them, not assuming the general will or public interest.

It is rational to seek to modify existing regimes rather than abandoning unsatisfactory ones. Regimes tend to evolve.

International regimes perform the valuable functions of reducing the costs of legitimate transaction while increasing the costs of illegitimate ones, and of reducing uncertainty. International regimes authorize certain types of bargaining for certain purposes - their most important function is to facilitate negotiations, affecting incentives for compliance by linking issues together.
