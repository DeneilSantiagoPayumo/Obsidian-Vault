## Information

This section comprises a set of articles by Asian scholars based in Asia to address these questions around Asian states. It also features the views of nine other Asian powers: India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

International order is defined as the dominant set of norms and institutions that govern inter-state relations.

## Liberal internationalism and Asian conceptions of order

The dominant characterization of the current international order is liberal internationalism.

First, the LIO is fundamentally an international or inter-state order conceived of in terms of the relations between sovereign states that bear the primary rights and responsibilities of international life. It is the product of interstate interactions and in turn is constructed to preserve the primacy of states - not civilisations, not empires, not commonwealths, and not tribes and clans.

Second, if stateness is the primary constitutive norm, LIO features further substructures of constitutive norms and institutions. From the point of view of Asian conceptions of order, three other norms are vital: independence, equality and rule of law.

Third, the LIO is at its most liberal in terms of regulatory norms and institutions. G. John Ikenberry lists five key regulatory norms and institutions: openness in trade and various forms of exchange; 2) multilateralism or a loose set of rules that govern inter-state relations; 3) cooperative security which entails that ‘states within the order affiliate in ways designed to increase their security’, including but not restricted to alliances and collective security; 4) reformism or the expectation that ‘[p]ower politics can be tamed—at least to some extent’; and 5) political progressivism towards liberal democracy as a widely accepted form of social organization.

A number of ideas: (1372-1375)
1. It is clear from the contribution to the section that Asians hold to the view that international life should be constituted by states and their interactions with each other. Asian states understand that some states are more powerful - "the mighty are therefore to be feared (and sometimes used as protectors), but they are not to be routinely obeyed."
2. Our authors show that Asian states want an international order based on the constitutive norms of independence, equality, and the rule of law. Independence is the freedom to choose one's internal political system and to define one's friends and enemies, what some in Asia call 'strategic autonomy.' Equality means that envoys and representatives can sit at the table but **not** equity. Asian states support the key LIO tenets of independence, equality and rule of law, but in their experience LIO practices often violate those tenets. Asians therefore charge the United States and other western powers with hypocrisy and inconsistency
3. All the LIO's regulatory norms find support in Asia except the march towards a liberal democracy. They support openness in trade, generalized exchange, cooperative security but stop at liberal democracy.

## Divergences among Asian states (1375-1379)

Asian states diverge on liberal democracy and the way they voice dissatisfaction. Even Japan refuses to endorse liberal democracy as an exclusionary principle in order-building.

Second divergence relates to the acceptability and importance of the US alliance in the region. Japan and South Korea stand out at one end of a spectrum - strong allies of the US, and though there occasional policy differences with Washington, both states sees the alliance as legitimate and vital for their security and the preservation of regional order.

Other Asian states are ambivalent - Philippines, Thailand, formal allies of the US. Further along the spectrum of possibilities are Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. All four have stopped short of seeking an alliance and yet have strong defence relations with the US.

Singapore too values the US's stabilizing security role, even though it is irked by American comments on human rights and democracy.

India and China are the least likely to endorse the US alliance system - it has rejected the idea of an alliance and indicated its preference for a 'multipolarity'

Final divergence - how they express their dissatisfaction with the current order. No Asian state has exited the LIO altogether - all ten states featured display loyalty to key tenets but also express dissatisfaction, particularly over the necessity of political liberalism and acceptability of the US alliance.

Three major types of voice are apparent: 

Japan and South Korea largely support the current order but supplement their own regional security. Tokyo now insists that it is inclusionary and not directed against any power (read: China). The resurrection of the quad—the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue—by Japan may also be thought of as exclusionary, but that must be balanced against Japan’s engagement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

South-east Asia expresses voice in a different way, namely, through its insistence on ‘ASEAN centrality’ and the ‘ASEAN way’ - look to the organisation to provide Asia with norms, institutions, and practice that will promote cooperation, stability and peace.

Indonesia, India and China represent a third pattern of voice - tonality is more critical and assertive toward the current order. Indonesia is certainly supportive of ASEAN's mediatory voice, but is insistent on the need for reform of existing international institutions.

Three powers want a greater say in determining it.

## Summary:

"First, despite the worry that the current order is under threat of near-collapse, major Asian powers are largely supportive of the reigning constitutive as well as regulatory norms and institutions. For policy-makers everywhere, the lesson is not to panic about the LIO's future and not to overreact in response to its reported decline." (1379)

"Second, the word *liberal* in connection with the current order disturbs or irks most Asian powers, conjuring images of an order that is ideological. Asians prefer the term rules-based international order. To speak the word 'order' is to imply rules, either tacit or explicit, but Asians emphasize the modifier 'rules-based' to express their discomfort with the word 'liberal'. Behind their discomfort is the fear they reject as being unfair or incompatible with their traditional or contemporary values." (1379)

"Third, Asians are in varying degrees ambivalent about the US's military alliances, but it is better for allied governments to privately manage their partnership rather than voice public criticism. The overall policy lesson for the US is that berating smaller Asian countries for not living up to alliance commitments only alienates them. Asian allies harbour concerns about the rise of China, and they value US military reassurances, but they do not want to recreate the rigidities of Europe or east Asia in the Cold War. Publicly, they want to project an equidistance between China and the US, while relying on the alliance not just for deterrence and defence but also to improve their bargaining power vis-à-vis Beijing. Constantly ‘fixing’ the alliance is overstretch and overreach." (1380)

"Fourth, all Asians want a voice in the construction and maintenance of international order. They can all point to their contribution to order building, and in this sense the current international order is not a gift of the western powers: it is important to recognise that it is owned and operated by Asians and other non-western states as much as by the West.  Asian states, as middle and rising powers, have adapted to and localized reigning norms and institutions." (1380)

"Fifth, Indonesia, India and China as rising mega-states with a desire to be norm shapers need to be given greater voice in international negotiations and institutions." (1380)

"Finally, domestic politics matters and therefore international order will be prone to flux. Asian satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the current international order are related in part to domestic political differences, principally between more conservative and more liberal forces."
