# Struggles for Individual Rights and the Expansion of the International System

## Article Introduction

>[!abstract]
> How can we explain these great waves of expansion, each of which saw imperial systems of rule displaced by the now universal form of the sovereign state? After detailing the limits of existing explanations, this article presents a new account of the waves of systemic expansion.
> 
> Empires are hierarchies, the legitimacy sustained historically by traditional regimes of unequal entitlement - institutional frameworks that allocate individuals of different social status different social powers and entitlements. Waves of expansion produced many of today's sovereigns states and gave the system its regions, new modern ideas about individual rights that challenged the interpretations imperial hierarchy. Each wave differed due to different rights: of liberty of religious conscience, the right to equal political representation, and now a compendium of civil and political rights. When the imperial system in question proved incapable of accommodating the new rights claims and subjects, people turned to 'exit' - the sovereign state here was seen as the alternative to empire.

This article will focus on the Westphalian, Latin American and post-1945 waves that spawned today's sovereign states and gave the International system its regions - the fragmentation of one or more empires into sovereign states.

This refers to the expansion of the international system and not society - the assumption that international systems are quasi-physical realms where constituent states are proximate and encounter one another sufficiently often that they have to take each other into account.

Historically states have been incorporated into the international system when they have either freed themselves from the control of their transnational authorities or when their sovereignty has been recognised by extant sovereign states. However with Westphalia the two occurred at the same time, Latin America first then second and with the post-1945 decolonization, international recognition was a critical factor in enabling people to free themselves from imperial authorities.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Existing explanations as for why colonies freed themselves from imperial control (and why they're wrong)

*Structural changes in the world economy:*
Because hegemony is thought to reduce great power competition and encourage free trade, imperial powers are free to relax control and promote decolonization.

This is dumb. After 1945 the US failed to provide support for decolonization. There is little evidence that reduced rivalry among the Western great powers encouraged them to relinquish their powers.

*Incorporation into International Society*:
For the English school, the expansion of international society is conceived as a process of social incorporation in which established European states defined the norms of membership, aspiring polities were socialized to conform to these norms, adapting their domestic institutions and international practices and the community of extant states ordained compliant polities with sovereign rights.

This model does not fit into the great waves - political struggles drove each wave and this challenged dominant interpretations of membership norms. Waves of expansions were bound up with revisions to prevailing norms of legitimate statehood.

*Socialization into World Culture*:
Sociological institutionalists would believe that world society's modernist culture have encouraged the spread of sovereign states through the transmission of the nation-state model from Western powers to their dependencies and the diffusion of colonisation by example.

This explains nothing about the Westphalian wave: rational bureaucratic nation-state was an achievement yet to be realized and decolonization has not occurred to be imitated.

It is simplistic to use this model - the existence of the sovereign model is not enough to guarantee interest. But in Latin America, the example was established but for three decades after 1776 the prevailing mood favoured autonomy within empire and not sovereign independence.


### The Argument

#### Empires and rights

Empires are systems of imperative control - according to [[Max Weber]], the probability that a command with a specific content will be obeyed by a given group of persons. (215-216)

Empires are hierarchies - defining features are the asymmetrical distribution of power between the metropolitan state and peripheral polities and unequal distribution of social powers between metropolitan citizens and colonial subjects.

Two things have sustained this - institutional structures that generate social norms and unequal subject positions that naturalize hierarchy and secondly the legitimacy of imperial hierarchy that has been rationalized by metropolitan elites.

Empires in this study developed idiosyncratic institutional structures, resting on a regime of unequal entitlements. They differed from the individual rights that animated struggles for institutional change in two aspects - they were "special" entitlements that arose out of special transactions between individuals and secondly, they were differential and allocated to citizens on the basis of social role.

The Holy Roman Empire, the Spanish Empire and Europe's 19th and 20th century empires suffered crises of legitimacy - a political institution commands legitimacy when those subject to its rule consider it rightful. When those perceptions erode, the institution must be adapted or thus disempowered.

Here, rights-holders were thought to constitute integral moral beings. These rights were considered equal not differential:

```ad-example
title: Different rights (218)
collapse: closed
![[Pasted image 20240124141506.png]]
```

Individual rights are institutionally dependent, their protection and satisfaction requires an enabling institutional framework. People here *did* go to the sovereign state but why this institutional form?

```ad-quote
title: 220-21
"First, Integral to each struggle was a universalizing yet bounding political imperative. Each of the general rights pursued by subject peoples required a political space, and matching institutional architecture, that was universalist, if not universal ... these factors pushed toward the sovereign state - "Westphalian" sovereignty promised the desired freedom from external authrotiies; "domestic" sovereignty a universalist regime of law.
Second, as anticipated above, in all but the Westphalian wave a process of dynamic modeling was at work. The sovereign states that emerged were products of endogenous political struggles, institutional by-products of the curtailing of transnational authorities and the transfer of political power to local princes.
...
Third, if the above two factors help explain the "turn to sovereignty" they do not explain why particular states, in particular locales, with particular boundaries emerged with  the collapse of particular empires.
```

In this argument struggles for recognition of individual rights were necessary but insufficient cause of fragmentation of particular empires into sovereign state.

A multitude of factors were implicated in each historical transformation meaning they were "insufficient" but they are "necessary" because in their absence history would have been different.

New ideas of individual rights performed three roles (222):
1. Fermenting imperial crises of legitimacy where subject peoples reimagined themselves as moral and political subjects allowing people to acquire new political interests.
2. Ideas about individual rights and the arguments provided justificatory resources in struggle over legitimate political authority.
3. Ideas about individual rights constituted deal-breakers, principles that had to be reorganized if attempts to resolve imperial crises of legitimacy were to succeed.

In all three waves ideas about rights performed each of these functions. However, there is a difference between Westphalian & Latin American waves and the post-1945 wave. In the first two, crises of legitimacy occurred within single empires and in the latter multiple empires felled into crises.

Two implications: first, that with the post-1945 wave, new ideas of individual rights did not ferment all anticolonial struggles and second, the emergent human rights institution of the UN enabled newly independent colonial states to challenge the legitimacy of empire in general.

"The upshot of all this is that the balance between the roles ideas played varied across the three waves of expansion, with the diversity of imperial contexts, and new institutional opportunity structures, privileging their justificatory role in the post-1945 case." (223)

#### Individual Rights and Nationalism

What role do we attribute to nationalism? We follow [[Ernest Gellner]] in defining nationalism as "a political principle that holds that the political and national units should be congruent." and distinguish between aggregative and communal forms of nationalism.

In the former, the nation is imagined as a collectivity of free and equal individuals and in the latter, as a cultural community bound by bonds of language, religion and race. Only in the post-Versailles waves did communal nationalism predominate. In the Latin American wave and anticolonial struggles of the post-1945 waves, varieties of aggregative nationalism predominated.

An important thing to note - in the Latin American and post-1945 waves of expansion struggles for individual rights and nationalism were deeply entwined, the former constituted the latter and the metropole's denial of equal rights was a catalyst for political mobilization.

#### Rights by Other Means

The argument advanced here contrasts with two others that also draw links between the politics of individual rights and the development of the system of sovereign states.

The first argument advanced by [[Charles Tilly]] and [[North]] claims that "revenue for rights" bargains played in the development of European states - that rulers seeking to secure financial resources, rulers struck deals with their subjects to give them political rights. This is a different category of rights compared to other rights and does not fit the causal model as here the politics of rights that drove the principal waves does not fit their causal model.

The second argument stressed by [[Ruggie]] stresses the constitutive power of ideas - the shift from medieval to modern conceptions of property rights. Ruggie is concerned with special rights, not general rights and neglects the role that individual rights played in concrete political struggles - how they informed understandings of entitlement, undercut legitimacy and more.

### Three Waves of Systematic Expansion

#### *The Westphalian Settlement* (225-228)

- At the start of the 16th century, Europe's political order was 'heteronomous'
- The ideas of the Reformation challenged this order fundamentally. "Beneath these ideas lay a distinctive conception of the individual as an integral moral agent, whose capacity for faith gave them direct access to the grace of God, and through this salvation." (226). By the middle of the 16th century, over half of the imperial cities were Protestant.
- Emperor Charles V convened the 1541 and 1546 Diets of Regensburg - contention over the doctrine of "justification", the way sinners established righteousness before God. Tensions were high and war soon broke out.
- The Peace of Augsburg was the first step on the road.
- The peace was inherently unstable, though, as it failed to deal with the key issue animating the preceding decades of religious conflict - the individual's right to liberty of religious conscience, the root of the divisions over justification. 
- The Peace of Westphalia ended the 30 years war and religion declined as a primary source of European conflicts. It succeeded as it combined two things - it reaffirmed the principle of *cuius regio, euis religio* and licensed the creation of confessionally independent states, endowing them with political rights. Also, the treaties "compromised" the emerging states sovereignty, giving minority rights provisions. Protestants living in Catholic states and vice versa were to be patiently suffered.
- But the treaties protections went beyond this, granting all subjects religious rights against their princes.
- "By doing these things, the Peace of Westphalia produced the first great wave of systemic expansion, creating nascent sovereign states across Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. But the Sovereignty these states gained had a particular meaning, one in which the sovereign's authority did not legitimately extend to the prescription of religious beliefs."

#### *The independence of Spanish Armada* (228-232)

Why, in response to the Napoleonic usurpation, did Spanish Americans eventually choose independence?

The answer lies in the struggle by Spanish Americans for equal political representations in a reformed, post-Napoleonic empire, the failure of which was a critical factor in turning them from voice to exit.

- Like the Holy Roman Empire, the Spanish Empire rested on a hierarchical regime of differential political entitlement.
- Because Pope Alexander VI granted title to the Indies to the Kings of Castile and Leon, the Americas became the personal patrimony of the Spanish monarchy, not possessions of the Spanish state.
- Napoleon then occupied Spain and forced Charles IV and then Ferdinand VII to abdicate.
- It begged two questions - what is the nature of the people to which sovereignty reverts? And how is this "people" to be politically represented? Did the inhabitants of the empire constitute one or more peoples, and were their interests to be represented through some form of democracy, through traditional estates or by a benevolent monarch?
- Peninsula Spaniards were united in seeing the first of these questions: the Spanish Empire was one. Spanish Americans rejected this, arguing that the empire comprised several kingdoms. The Spanish Americans were divided between reformers and radicals - those who did not foreclose membership of the empire under an institutional framework and those who believe equality was a chimera.
- In the usurpation, the reformers were ascendant.
- Debates at the insurgent General Cortes were a tipping point - in 1812 the constitution of Cadiz was the most liberal constitution that was tainted by how it dealt with the question of political representation. Liberals all over dominated the Cortes and embraced the new distinctively modern idea that individuals had the right to political representation.
- ![[Pasted image 20240124150231.png]]
- Despite the Spanish American's arguments, they were outvoted by their peninsular counterparts.
- "The Cortes' failure to recognize the rights of Spanish Americans to equal political representation turned them from reform to revolution. For the radicals, the paltry Spanish American representation was proof that reform did not equal representation.

#### Post-1945 Decolonization (233-236)

After WW1, a third great wave of systemic expansion occurred, a consequence this time of the defeat and collapse of the German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empire - the rights of ethnically defined "nations" were crucial that upheld the principle that all nations had a right to self-determination.

- U.S President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed "the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak." 
- Principle instituted in a series of postwar accords, creating more than 20 new sovereign states where a communal conception of nation was applied. Not all ethnically defined nations were entitled to self-determination, however. Ethnic minorities "trapped" inside the new European states had no right of secession, and the principle did not apply to people living in Europe's overseas empires.
- This approach did not survive WW2.
- It was shattered by the Nazi's genocidal war for a culturally homogeneous greater Germany - the logical implication of trying to create a separate state was a mass expulsion of minorities.
- The post-Versailles self-determination regime was of little use to people seeking independence form empires after WW2. Most of Europe's colonies in Asia, Africa and the Pacific were culturally homogeneous unhelped by a principle that conferred sovereignty on ethnically homogenous nations. It also applied only to those within the "civilized world."
- "Struggle for recognition of individual rights were central to the fourth post-1945 wave of systemic expansion, in significant part because of the moral collapse and emancipatory deficiencies of the post-Versailles self-determination regime." (233)
- Many independent postcolonial states played a key role in the negotiation of the universal declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ... "postcolonial states insisted that protecting civil and political rights was an international obligation that could compromise states' domestic jurisdiction" (235) leading postcolonial states insisted that individuals should have the right to petition UN human right bodies.
- In this context postcolonial states reasserted the right to self-determination - grafting this latter right to emergent international human rights norms
- "These events produced a shift in international legitimacy - by pushing for the strong international codification of individual civil and political rights, and by grafting the right of self-determination to these emergent norms, post-colonial states not only reasserted this right in universal terms, they successfully undermined the institution of empire. By 1960, however, postcolonial states had successfully rehabilitated the previously discredited right to self-determination, redefining it as essential if the newly codified human rights of colonial peoples were to be respected." (236)
