# Struggles for Individual Rights and the Expansion of the International System

## Article Introduction

>[!abstract]
> How can we explain these great waves of expansion, each of which saw imperial systems of rule displaced by the now universal form of the sovereign state? After detailing the limits of existing explanations, this article presents a new account of the waves of systemic expansion.
> 
> Empires are hierarchies, the legitimacy sustained historically by traditional regimes of unequal entitlement - institutional frameworks that allocate individuals of different social status different social powers and entitlements. Waves of expansion produced many of today's sovereigns states and gave the system its regions, new modern ideas about individual rights that challenged the interpretations imperial hierarchy. Each wave differed due to different rights: of liberty of religious conscience, the right to equal political representation, and now a compendium of civil and political rights. When the imperial system in question proved incapable of accommodating the new rights claims and subjects, people turned to 'exit' - the sovereign state here was seen as the alternative to empire.

This article will focus on the Westphalian, Latin American and post-1945 waves that spawned today's sovereign states and gave the International system its regions - the fragmentation of one or more empires into sovereign states.

This refers to the expansion of the international system and not society - the assumption that international systems are quasi-physical realms where constituent states are proximate and encounter one another sufficiently often that they have to take each other into account.

Historically states have been incorporated into the international system when they have either freed themselves from the control of their transnational authorities or when their sovereignty has been recognised by extant sovereign states. However with Westphalia the two occurred at the same time, Latin America first then second and with the post-1945 decolonization, international recognition was a critical factor in enabling people to free themselves from imperial authorities.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Existing explanations as for why colonies freed themselves from imperial control (and why they're wrong)

*Structural changes in the world economy:*
Because hegemony is thought to reduce great power competition and encourage free trade, imperial powers are free to relax control and promote decolonization.

This is dumb. After 1945 the US failed to provide support for decolonization. There is little evidence that reduced rivalry among the Western great powers encouraged them to relinquish their powers.

*Incorporation into International Society*:
For the English school, the expansion of international society is conceived as a process of social incorporation in which established European states defined the norms of membership, aspiring polities were socialized to conform to these norms, adapting their domestic institutions and international practices and the community of extant states ordained compliant polities with sovereign rights.

This model does not fit into the great waves - political struggles drove each wave and this challenged dominant interpretations of membership norms. Waves of expansions were bound up with revisions to prevailing norms of legitimate statehood.

*Socialization into World Culture*:
Sociological institutionalists would believe that world society's modernist culture have encouraged the spread of sovereign states through the transmission of the nation-state model from Western powers to their dependencies and the diffusion of colonisation by example.

This explains nothing about the Westphalian wave: rational bureaucratic nation-state was an achievement yet to be realized and decolonization has not occurred to be imitated.

It is simplistic to use this model - the existence of the sovereign model is not enough to guarantee interest. But in Latin America, the example was established but for three decades after 1776 the prevailing mood favoured autonomy within empire and not sovereign independence.
