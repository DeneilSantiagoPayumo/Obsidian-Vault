## Article Introduction

>[!summary]
>This chapter focuses entirely on the Cold War's end, ranging broadly over the various explanation put forward by scholars, linking the main theoretical accounts to specific political, social, and psychological mechanisms that must come into play for these accounts to serve as explanations.
>
>Its main intent, however, is to show how one would evaluate the mechanisms that each theoretical approach implies through examination of a single event.

The justification for choosing the end of the Cold War is twofold - there is a rich array of contending theories whose underlying mechanisms are worth elucidating on and for many students of IR, the end of the cold war has called into question some of the leading paradigms in the field.

First, the author reviews the possible events that constitute the end of the Cold War - honing in on Gorbachev's December 1988.

Next, I turn to a basic process-tracing exercises to ponder the question "how far down" to go in gathering detailed evidence. By tracing a process further back in history we can bring into light explanatory factors.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### A thicket of theories (and mechanisms):

1. Realist approaches emphasize a combination of the relative East-West balance of military and economic power.
2. Ideational approaches represent the impact of new ways of understanding the Soviet security predicament and the relationship between foreign policy and the goals of domestic political reform. Economic and military coalition can be manipulated by norm entrepreneurs.
3. Coalition-politics approaches stress the interests of particular sectors of Soviet society and the concomitant foreign policies that would best serve them. The principal mechanisms for this theoretical approaches include political strategies such as log-rolling and agenda-setting
4. Cognitive psychological and personality-based approaches seek to explain changes in Soviet security policy  from confrontation to cooperation.

There is a bunch of overlap. This chapter will resolve neither when the Cold War ended nor which theories best explain that end. The goal is to illustrate the method.

### Gorbachev's December 1988 speech as a key event

This is part of a longer-term process - well before his speech, Gorbachev told his Politburo colleagues in July 1986 - "The methods that were used in Czechoslovakia and Hungary now are no good, they will not work!"

This speech however was to mark the end of the cold war.

*Problems with the realist account* - realist accounts stress economic constraints as prompting Soviet military retrenchment and that ideational and coalition-politics acknowledge the role of economic concerns.

The problem is not that there is no evidence that Soviet leaders were concerned about economic conditions but that dissatisfaction with the state of the Soviet economy is evident throughout the history of the USSR.

The economic explanation is not the best account as it passes the hoop test so easily - "to adjudicate between economic factors and other explanations, we need to "disaggregate" the economic explanations" by finding specific ones.

One variant relates to Gorbachev's December 1988 suggests that Soviet political and military leaders were united in seeking to improve the Soviet military posture by short-term restraint in the interest of a longer-term competitive advantage, known as "breathing space."

Some analysts use a "smoking-gun" test to demonstrate Soviet military support for short-term retrenchment, qualitative reductions and budget cuts - consisting of public statements.

Thus, nobody believed retrenchment was on the menu.

Some argue that the fact that people were not aware of how close to collapse the economies were is not evidence that the collapse is important ... but the Soviet military did see the collapse coming and tried to do something about it.

... (not sure on what to pick out, return to this later perhaps)

"As presented here, the process-tracing exercise leading to Gorbachev's speech followed a simple chronological approach, one attentive to which actors - identified as theoretically relevant - were doing what and when. The civilian reformers took the initiative to put forward proposals. The top leader accepted the proposals and issued orders to the military to implement them. He then secured a pro forma approval from his fellow leaders at the last minute and made the public announcement of his initiative." (171)

This exercise  shows that the military were not behind the initiative even though objectively there was no need for so many troops in Europe as nuclear deterrence could maintain Soviet security.

```ad-quote
Gorbachev was not a big believer in nuclear deterrence. At least he did not value it enough to prefer it over nuclear disarmament. That is why the Reykjavik summit meeting with Ronald Reagan made such an impression on him." (174)


```

"The Reykjavik summit of October 1986 was the occasion when both Gorbachev and Reagan publicly expressed support for a nuclear-free world and came close to negotiating the complete elimination of nuclear-armed missiles. (174)

If we process trace further back, we may see that much of Gorbachev's foreign policy orientation may  be linked to the explosion at the Chernobyl camp in Ukraine. - it provided a "policy window" where "Gorbachev and his supporters could use the tragedy to prolong the unilateral Soviet moratorium on nuclear testing against plainly evident domestic opposition." (174)

....

"Every serious account of Gorbachev's personality and background stresses that he was not an enthusiast of Soviet military power." (181) .... so was this a limit of realist approach?

A counterfactual experiment would be to wonder what Gorbachev would've done if the Soviet Union benefitted from high oil prices - he would have been satisfied with "off-loading" the burden of the subsidies. It's hard to imagine Gorbachev using military weapons under the circumstances of the Western refusal to allow Soviet integration into the global market.

Another element which is hard for realists to understand is how much he was concerned for the ordinary citizens. Many observers still believe that Gorbachev was motivated by an interest in maintaining the Soviet Union's status as a superpower. Retrenchment was necessary for the USSR to re-emerge as the worthy rival.

Yet Gorbachev did not mention this factor at all, he complained about the burden of the subsidies out of a sense of injustice and resentment.

### Conclusion: process tracing all the way down

The first claim made by this chapter is that the "event" of the Cold War is made up of many events and data points.

The second is that process tracing is a useful method for evaluating the competing theoretical explanations.

The third claim is that evaluating explanations entails identifying their underlying mechanisms and their observable implications. Several mechanisms can account for the same event.

A close examination of Mikhail's "freedom of choice" is of no victor.

[[William Wohlforth]] concludes that they (alternative approaches) may be necessary to account for the fact that even if realism tells us how states *should* behave, leaders may not follow.

"Gorbachev, in Wohlforth's view, followed the dictates of realism only to a point because he failed to steer the Soviet ship of state to safer harbour, wrecking it on the shoals of nationalism and economic chaos instead." (184) To understand why then, we must undergo a policy of process tracing.
