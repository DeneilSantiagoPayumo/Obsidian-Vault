[[Peace of Westphalia]]

---
148

## Introduction

-> distinct separate politics became sovereign
-> enjoying absolute exclusive historical fact

149

-> an order created by states, for states
-> Leo Gross emphasised how 1648 constituted a turning point in the organisation of Europe

```ad-quote
title: Leo Gross
"Westphalia, for better or worse, marks the end of an epoch and the opening of another. It represents the majestic portal which leads from the old into the new world."
```

-> consecrated the principle of sovereign equality of states ... the core of international law

150

-> this paper will explain 'contrary to the overwhelmingly accepted view.'

151

-> constitutes one instance where distinct separate political entities strived for more power through independence
-> discussion will deconstruct Westphalian model through a four-part analysis.

First, the social organisation will be considered.
Second, a brief account of the dynamics at work in Europe and events that led to the 30 years war will be considered.
Third, the actual agreements will be examined to ascertain their material provisions.
Finally, the post-1648 period will be considered if universal institutions disappeared in favour of distinct separate policies.


152

## Heteronomous Organisations and Transcendental Political Entities

-> after West Rome collapsed, territories in Europe were in chaos
-> Separate communities made segmented societies characterised by a heteronomous form of organisation
-> individuals had different rights since feudal structure was not hierarchical
-> the vassalage system meant subordinates acquired different corresponding power .... 'shifting lordships.'

153

-> this period saw polities getting in a common Christian community
-> this spiritual union encouraged contacts, the catalyst to a profound social transformation of almost all Western Europe
-> Brought the Pope and Emperor, aspiring to the throne
-> not peaceful

154

-> After treaty of Verdun 843, Roman Emperor vs Pope
-> Pope uses two swords doctrine
-> Emperor replied with formulas supporting secular authority over communitas communitatum
-> God has equally distributed spiritual and temporal powers, Emperor received the secular sword.
-> detente

155

-> European society, struggle between Papacy and German Empire, civil societies of Europe

## Dynamics and War of Religion and Politics

-> interactions of different polities ... allowed monarchies to gain a good position on European chessboard
-> despite tons of effort, Papacy not recognised
-> England repudiated Papal overlordship
-> Great Schism in the Christian Church weakened the authority of the Pope

156

-> Luther nailed his 95 theses, setting in forces of the reformation
-> no overall authority was ever fully secured in Europe ... the character and the scope of Imperial power began to be challenged
-> authority over secular matters ceased to be considered the exclusive privilege of the Emperor.
-> de jure overlordship remained ... but Bartolus admitted that princes do not acknowledge any superior.

157

->  However: consolidation of power under autonomous rulers in England and France and emergence of free cities  ... replaced the Christendom ideal with the concept of distinct separate polities.
->  The quarells between Pope and Emperor helped the establishment of these self-sufficient polities.
->  England was the first large geographic area to reach some kind of centralized governance - English segmented societies embarked upon the process towards unity.

158

-> The aristocracy-initiated movement of protest ... sought some basic guarantees of protection from the king, especially with property rights.
-> The French communities proceeded more slowly towards the organisation of central ruling under the authority of the monarch - centralisation accomplished gradually through appointment of the king's representatives in the provinces.
-> The 100 years war only increased the King's power in his territory.

159

-> with subordinates being ruined and weakened, people turned to the monarch for protection and guidance.
-> even in German areas, increasingly substantial political concessions were gradually granted in favour of the principalities
-> several powerful German Princes took the Protestant side in the emerging conflicts, revolting against the Holy Roman Empire
-> these turmoil were settled with the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 between the Emperor and the Protestant Princes ... contributing to direct the focus towards the separate politics within the Empire.
-> this truce deteriorated over the next 50 years as restrictions were imposed on the right to worship freely. 

160

-> protestants and Catholics were not very happy with each other
-> rivalries did not stop at the German border
-> the spark that ignited the fire came from Bohemia in 1618 with the Defenestration of Prague, a revolt against the Emperor and the Catholic domination - the 30 years war.
-> it was based on religious antagonism but after the first decade, the power politics of the belligerents dominated the main battles, fought between France and Sweden

161

-> then came about the Peace of Westphalia
-> by the end of the 17th century, Europe was no longer dominated by the Holy Roman Empire or the Papacy.

162

-> Politics both within and without the Empire established a solid foundation based on the idea of political autonomy.

### The Peace Treaties and their Ramifications

-> composed of two separate agreements
-> Treaty of Osnabruck was concluded between two groups of political entities: the Protestant Queen of Sweden and her allies, and the Holy Roman Habsburg Emperor and the German Princes.
-> Treaty of Munster was also concluded between two groups: the Catholic King of France and his allies, and on the other, the Emperor and the Princes.

163

-> Treaties paid homage to the unity of Christendom, Sweden and France insisted on having German Princes as parties to the Peace, a strategy meant to weaken the position of the Emperor
-> These treaties were meant to deal with constitutional matters within the Empire
-> article 70

164

-> First and foremost, the main object of the Peace of Westphalia was to establish a regime on religious practice and denominational matters, providing important constitutional safeguards.
-> recognised freedom of conscience for Catholics living in Protestant areas and vice versa. 

165

-> Osnaruck promoted equality between Catholics and Protestants in the assemblies of the Diet and in other decision-making institutions of the Empire.
-> The second main object of the Peace of Westphalia concerned territorial settlements, turning on the satisfaction of Sweden and France.
-> It must be emphasised ... that the conveyances were not total ... the Swedish ruler was to occupy seats in the Diet to represent these regions within the Empire.
-> Pursuant to the Treaty of Munster, France was granted territories "with all manner of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty, without any contradiction from the Emperor, the Empire, House of Austria, or any other."

166

-> although they had passed under the French Crown, these parts of the Alsatian territory nevertheless maintained some autonomist status based on Imperial privileges.
-> The Treaty provisions relating to religious and denominational practice ... represent the two main objects of the Peace of Westphalia.
-> The parties recognised the United Provinces of the Netherlands and provided for the independence of the Swiss Confederation.

167

-> The political entities making up the Empire were given the power to make agreements between themselves and other countries, limited the caveat that no such alliance could be directed against the imperium or be in preach of the Peace of Westphalia instead.

168

-> It appears that these Treaty articles merely recognised a practice which had already been in practice ... German Princes were conducting their own foreign policy long before Westphalia ... not ground breaking
-> Rest of provisions - general amnesty, neutralistation of territory
-> Conclusion: material provision of the Osnabruck and Munster treaty do not support the traditional position that the Peace of Westphalia constitutes a paradigm shift whereby political entities involved gained power over their territories. Main purpose revolve around religion and settlement of territory.

169

-> What Westphalia marks is nothing more than a step towards the progressive shift from the ideal of a universal overlordship to the concept of distinct separate political entities enjoying independence.

## The Empire and Westphalia's Aftermath

-> These previous treaties constitute a turning point that allowed German distinct separate polities to exercise exclusive control and power over their territories.

170

-> Empire: (see main doc for a short breakdown of Roman leadership structure)
-> These bodies included diet and Emperor - the diet being advisory and legislative.

171

-> Very little was accomplished in Diet due to deadlocks caused by denominational equality or lack of unanimity.
-> Impeded leadership and direction given to the Empire was fertile ground for German polities to claim and exercise power.
-> The Diet made a forum within the Imperial system where issues of national concerns could at least be considered and debated.
-> Additionally it is only mid 18th century (100 years after) that the Diet became dysfunctional

172

-> Imperial institutions continued to play their roles within the increasingly decentralised Empire for years after the peace.
-> Additionally, the Emperor declined in power after Westpahlia - mainly due to the expansion of the Landeshoheit principle. This erosion of imperial power began before 1648 - to the Golden Bull

173

-> Really, what ended the Empire was Napoleon's conquest of Germany.
-> An external force unrelated to the Empire brought it low.
-> Historians could not agree on who between the Emperor and the Princes who held the authority over the German territory.

174

-> Some historians suggested the Emperor and different constituting polities shared the supreme authority within the Empire.

175

-> Influenced by Hobbes, Pufendorf, concluding that German constitutional form was monstrous.
-> Main facet is that the Holy Roman Emprie did not dissipate as an aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia.

## Conclusion

-> Peace of Westphalia not a shift
-> No more than one case where distinct separate polities pursued their unending quest for more authority through greater independence.
-> it was seen that segmented and heteronomous organised medieval societies were based on decentralised feudal structures
-> the dynamics at work meant at the break of the 30 years war, the respective universal authorities of the Pope and Emperor had been depleted.
-> The principal objects have been shown to be concerned with religious matters - Westphalia was not the creation of independent polities, keeping the imperium very much alive.
-> Empire did not disappear in favour of disparate German polities.
-> hypothesis as wider argument concerning semantics surrounding sovereignty..
