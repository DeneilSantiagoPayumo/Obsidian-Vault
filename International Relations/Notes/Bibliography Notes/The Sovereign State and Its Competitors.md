We take the present system of sovereign states for granted but it was not. The sovereign state had its rivals but not - it is appropriate to rethink our explanations of the origins of the state system, analyse said forces, and reflect on the possibility of its demise.

Where we are today is the result of a long historical process. At the end of the Middle Ages, the international system went through a dramatic transformation in which the crosscutting jurisdiction of feudal lords ... went way to territorially defined authority.

The new element introduced by the late medieval state was the notion of sovereignty - the critical turn in the political organization of the Late Middle Ages. It was instead the concept of sovereignty that altered the structure of the international system by basing political authority on the principle of territorial exclusivity - based on internal hierarchy and external autonomy which emerged for the first time in the Late Middle Ages.

When scholars focus on the emergence of the state, they mean the growth of formal governments - why some governments took the form of sovereign, territorial rule whereas others did not. This book analyses the development of hierarchy within politics and the effects of sovereignty on the relations between states.

Additionally, factors like economic interdependence, ecological disasters, and globalization of financial markets have led to a search for new ways to organize domestic and international politics. Thereof, social scientist have discussed the possibility of transformation.

The contemporary era requires to confront the question of how new forms of organization might emerge and change - the problem is that we can't talk about these questions theoretically. My major aim is to address that issue and explain how these elements change.

Much of the literature are flawed - they see institutional evolution as 'unilinear' and explain the demise of feudalism as an evolutionary process.

This is incorrect - unilinear theories of change affirm the consequent. A theory of change should account for variation in the observed outcome.

These accounts do not do justice to history - the transformation did not occur unilinearly, the decline of the feudal order produced a flurry of institutional innovation. Urban leagues (and more) emerged to challenge the existing institutional order of empire, church and feudal lordships.

it is clear that alternatives to the state have died, with powerful city-leagues that organised northern commerce and considerable urban resources no more. Similarly, the city-states have ceased to exist.

Unilinear views only examine how the state proved to be superior to feudal organization - commonly assumed to comparative politics, focusing on the extractive capabilities of the state vis-a-vis society.

Sovereign states survived whilst city-leagues and city-states proved to be dead ends. Why? Both of those organizational forms were also more efficient than feudal types, and hence cannot suffer with the explanation that states became the dominant type of organization simply because they were more efficient.

The causes of the emergence of the sovereign state are not the same as the causes that explain selection among synchronic institutional alternatives - contracting the causes of the demise of feudalism with the causes of the rise of the state system.

By abandoning the idea of unilinear progress and acknowledging the variety of political institutions, one can identify the sequences of institutional developments. By recognizing the wide range of empirical possibilities, one does not conflate the reasons for the decline of the feudal order with the reasons for the success of the sovereign state.

This case examines three empirical cases: the sovereign, the Hanseatic, the Italian city-states - successors. Then they'll explain why sovereign states became the constitutive elements of the international system. Then they can explain change in the international system in general.

## AN OUTLINE OF THE ARGUMENT

Unit type influences international relations - taking the transhistorical nature of anarchy as a given. 

I contend that the impact of the exogenous variable, trade, led to a variety of social coalitions - the different coalitions and bargains between kings, aristocracy and towns accounting for institutional variation across Europe. These coalitions created different institutions which better met the coalition material interests and ideological perspective - where sovereign states, city-leagues and city-states emerged from feudalism.

In France the social bargain between kings and burghers allowed for recentralization of monarchy, asserting royal sovereignty over the church and nobles. 

Whereas, in Germany the reserve took place where the German king allied with the feudal nobles against the towns. His policy failed, and feudal decentralization occurred and German towns formed independent leagues to protect their interests against the lords. 

In Italy, the failed imperial policy of the German king led to independent communes which gradually developed into city-states. The Italian nobles engaged in urban, mercantile pursuits, hence the feudal-urban dichotomy that characterized Germany failed to appear: Italian towns did not ally with the king.

The resulting realignments in Europe led to variety of new political institutions: the sovereign, territorial state, the city-league, and the city-state.

Not all of these new units were equally efficient - the dynamic of competitive advantage selected out those units that were less effective and less efficient. Sovereign authority proved to be more adept at preventing freeriding, standardizing weights and coinage, and establishing uniform adjudication. Additionally, having the sovereign to coordinate proved an advantage over city-league. Furthermore, territorial sovereignty proved incompatible with non-territorial logics of organisation.

The interaction between internal and external spheres is a two-staged process. Changes in the external milieu lead to domestic shifts in relative power between socio-political actors. These actors realign to form new types of institutions, becoming apart of the external environment which consists of the whole array of institutional possibilities. These arrangements will not be as efficient as the leader. Moreover, some actors need to structure their interactions with others, some forms of organization will be less attractive than others.

We should expect a multiplicity of alternatives to arrive. Institutional change will occur through a two-fold process: a stage of institutional emergence and a subsequent stage of systemic selection.

The account of social evolution proves some justification for the claim that institutional change is an infrequent phenomenon. Change in institutions impose costs, and socio-political actors will be unwilling to experiment unless a serious shock alters alignments.

Change will take the form of a punctuated equilibrium - a dramatic shift along several dimensions in response to an environmental change.

Usually the status quo will prevail and change is marginal.

Chapter 8:

The Victory of the Sovereign State

The economic transformations of the Late Middle Ages inspired individualists to create new forms of organisation in western Europe.

These new forms differed in their degree of internal hierarchy.

I have argued that the economic transformation of the Late Middle Ages inspired individuals to create new forms of organizations in Western Europe.

These new forms differed from one another in their degree of internal hierarchy, and if their authority was demarcated by territorial parameters.

Sovereign states contained a locus of authority - but not absolutism. Even Hobbes found that sovereigns could take the form of parliamentary rule. Even in those states, there existed a final decision-making structure that had no outside interference and gained a monopoly on violence and justice: as though the sovereign state confined itself territorially.

The city-league formed the antithesis of the sovereign, territorial state. Did the final decision making reside with individual cities or with an executive body of the league of towns? Confederation (with the Hansa) made this unclear. Additionally, they were nonterritorial - the leagues lacked borders, integrated for mutual defence and commercial interests.

The city-state formed an intermediate category of institutional structure. With the sovereign, it had in common a demarcation of jurisdiction by fixed borders - the dominant city acting as the focal point for interunit contacts. But the city-state was internally divided, consisting of one city dominating other towns.

These two facets of organization, internal hierarchy and territorial demarcation can be used to examine the systems of rules.

Feudal organization lacked a clear centre and territorial borders. Empire and church claimed final decision-making power but lacked territorial specification of their authority.

The Hansa, Italian city-states and the French state all cued into the new market opportunities created from the transition from local trade to long-distance commerce. Only one from these alternatives survived,

What happened in the three centuries preceding Westphalia? Particular policies, changing fortunes in war, shifting trade routes and idiosyncrasies of rulers all provide explanations, changing location of the herring schools, the stilting of the harbour in Brugues, or the opening of transatlantic routes are presented as explanations for the waning of the Hansa.

But what can we elicit general lessons from their demise - although the descent of the Hanseatic League, or of Venice and Florence, are interesting in their own right, the broader challenging questions is why do they die?

The diminishing fortunes of the Hansa and Venice do not fully explain why city-leagues and city-states, as particular logics of organization should have disappeared.

Sovereigns could credibly also speak on their constituencies, forcing subjects to follow through on agreements reached. Because of their territorial character, states were compatible with one another - jurisdictions specified through agreements on fixed borders.

Also, institutional selection occurred by mimicry and exit - attractive institutions were copied by political elites. Societal actors voted with their feet - leaving institutions not to their liking.


## THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION: DARWINIAN SELECTION BY WAR

For some, it occurs through war - those less able to defend themselves are annihilated.

One body of literature studied is hegemonic rivalry literature - arguing that dominant actors in the system are periodically challenged and defeated, with Spain giving way to the Netherlands and England.

But it focuses on different issues: on rank order change,  or systemic change.

Despite the fact that this and long-cycle literature pay no attention to the type of competing units, we could see whether their explanation might also hold true for competition between different forms of organizations.

Some variants:
1. Compares sovereigns to feudal mode of organization where sovereigns can raise more revenue and troops ... but city-leagues and city-states were also superior. The Hansa could raise troops and equip large fleets against Denmark, England and Holland.
2. Compares the sovereign state to its synchronic rival and argues that the state surpassed city-leagues and city-states because of  command of more territory and population - but doesn't take into account of scenarios like the Dutch (of about 1.5 million) becoming leading powers of the international system of the early sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

Another puzzle is how small sovereign states continued to survive - the continued existence of small German principalities. Why had the Hansa disappeared whereas some of the towns had been members continued as independent actors in the international system?

The author argues that success lies in the particular institutional makeup of different forms of organization.

Warfare is an indicator - the organizational skills and training could assist but *also* the organizational structure, wherein sovereign states could raise more money than their rivals.

The long term of these effects were weighed by actors as we will see.

## ADVANTAGES OF SOVEREIGN TERRITORIALITY OVER THE CONFEDERATED CITY-LEAGUE

Selection operates in three ways:
1. Darwinism survival of the fittest
2. Mutual empowerment (where certain sovereign actors had reasons to prefer systems of rules elsewhere, limiting opportunities for others)
3. Deliberate mimicry and exit where Political elites copy forms they percieve as successful.

#### STANDARDIZATION AND CERTITUDE

One advantage was the existence of an actor who could tackle the legacies of feudal particularism - a vested interest in rationalizing the overall economy because it led to higher revenue and military capacity.

One of these barriers was lack of standardization - medieval measures were of many. This sprang from seigneurial control over measurements where many lords had taken over the rights to issue measurements, and were reluctant to give that up (as they could sell scales) and payments came in-kind, and could be manipulated. Lordly monopoly over the legal measures and scales provided a means for social control.

Also, measurements were very representation, reflecting human body parts - which was not consistent.

Additionaly, some authorities were competent in setting standards and others didn't.

The Hansa certainly didn't, with the league leaving autonomy to the towns and with many towns using their own measurements. They tried to induce standardization by requiring the quarters to follow the measurements of the dominant town of that group but it was little avail.

Enforcement of this rested with muncipal counsils but they were dominated by the very merchants responsible for said violations. The German cities lacked a sovereign authority who could exercise such justice.

In France, kings tried to standardize measures (Charles IX, Henry III, Louis XIV) but it met opposition from the old members of the bourgeois: clergy and nobles who opposed this loss of control.

Merchants and traders preferred more authority to the king rather than less - the Cahiers de Dolerances, letters of grievance sent to the court indicate that people thought the only authority that could end this was the French King. He only managed to install methods of converting measures.

They also had to contend with large assortments of coinage - transaction costs.

The French state fared better than the Hansa in centralizing the minting of the coin. The league didn't as other towns minted their own, and many others adopted different standards - dated from the decline of the Holy Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire and the Carolingian period, the issuage of coinage occured only under strict supervision.

The German emperor tried to maintain control but it was impossible: coinage passed to the dukes, counts and towns. By the sixteenth century, there was roughly 2,500 local and regional authorities.

The diversity had two consequences: First, merchants and tax collectors had to develop some way of comparing different currencies: the Hanseatic merchants had to contend with Lubeck, Pomeranian, Prussian marks and so on. Second, the value of the coin vary depending on its regional place of origin.

In France, coinage became regulated by the king - Louis IX decreed that in 1265 that royal coin should only be good throughout the realm.

One might consider that increased hierarchy has a negative consequence, leading to debasement for revenue but continued debasement would lead to a lack of confidence and raise the ire of merchants. Therein, the French king had an interest in establishing exchange rates to prevent a flight from occurring.

Likewise, the French centralized the legal system more than the Hansa, as the Hansa had a variety of legal codes on the muncipal level. Furthermore, the Hansa did not have any formalized system for determining whether particular issues called for municipal, regional or Hanseatic decisions as due to an absence of a formal constitution for much of their existence.

The Hansa feared doing this as they thought that this would prompt states to cut deals with towns and encourage free-riding.

In France, the kings underwent the right of adjudication - transforming acient rights into a factual exercise of royal power. Louis IX outlawed trial by combat in 1258, and kings enforced property rights.

They also institutionalized the means of raising revenue - large taxes being standardized on the Royal Taille and teh Gabelle (the salt tax).

The ad hoc nature of Hanseatic revenue precluded business certitude.

To sum up, the Hansa were less efficient in reducing transaction costs and providing collective goods than the sovereign state - not managing to provide standardization of weights, enforce centralized justice, establish a system of coinage or establish means of raising revenue for a fund.

### PREVENTING FREERIDING AND THE KING AS PUBLIC ACTOR

The confederated nature of the Hansa led to freeriding and defection - there were always incentive to disavow the edicts of the diet: defection from international agreements (engaging in piracy) led to the deterioration of relations with trading partners. The gains went to the towns, but the costs were borne by the entire Hansa.

Such defection included reneging on contributions to military campaigns and individual bargaining with non-Hanseatics.
In economic matters, towns such as Hamburg and Elbing were too willing to defec from Hansa stipulations that no privileges were to be granted to English traders using the Hansa port.
