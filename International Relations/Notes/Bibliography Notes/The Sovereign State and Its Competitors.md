We take the present system of sovereign states for granted but it was not. The sovereign state had its rivals but not - it is appropriate to rethink our explanations of the origins of the state system, analyse said forces, and reflect on the possibility of its demise.

Where we are today is the result of a long historical process. At the end of the Middle Ages, the international system went through a dramatic transformation in which the crosscutting jurisdiction of feudal lords ... went way to territorially defined authority.

The new element introduced by the late medieval state was the notion of sovereignty - the critical turn in the political organization of the Late Middle Ages. It was instead the concept of sovereignty that altered the structure of the international system by basing political authority on the principle of territorial exclusivity - based on internal hierarchy and external autonomy which emerged for the first time in the Late Middle Ages.

When scholars focus on the emergence of the state, they mean the growth of formal governments - why some governments took the form of sovereign, territorial rule whereas others did not. This book analyses the development of hierarchy within politics and the effects of sovereignty on the relations between states.

Additionally, factors like economic interdependence, ecological disasters, and globalization of financial markets have led to a search for new ways to organize domestic and international politics. Thereof, social scientist have discussed the possibility of transformation.

The contemporary era requires to confront the question of how new forms of organization might emerge and change - the problem is that we can't talk about these questions theoretically. My major aim is to address that issue and explain how these elements change.

Much of the literature are flawed - they see institutional evolution as 'unilinear' and explain the demise of feudalism as an evolutionary process.

This is incorrect - unilinear theories of change affirm the consequent. A theory of change should account for variation in the observed outcome.

These accounts do not do justice to history - the transformation did not occur unilinearly, the decline of the feudal order produced a flurry of institutional innovation. Urban leagues (and more) emerged to challenge the existing institutional order of empire, church and feudal lordships.

it is clear that alternatives to the state have died, with powerful city-leagues that organised northern commerce and considerable urban resources no more. Similarly, the city-states have ceased to exist.

Unilinear views only examine how the state proved to be superior to feudal organization - commonly assumed to comparative politics, focusing on the extractive capabilities of the state vis-a-vis society.

Sovereign states survived whilst city-leagues and city-states proved to be dead ends. Why? Both of those organizational forms were also more efficient than feudal types, and hence cannot suffer with the explanation that states became the dominant type of organization simply because they were more efficient.

The causes of the emergence of the sovereign state are not the same as the causes that explain selection among synchronic institutional alternatives - contracting the causes of the demise of feudalism with the causes of the rise of the state system.

By abandoning the idea of unilinear progress and acknowledging the variety of political institutions, one can identify the sequences of institutional developments. By recognizing the wide range of empirical possibilities, one does not conflate the reasons for the decline of the feudal order with the reasons for the success of the sovereign state.

This case examines three empirical cases: the sovereign, the Hanseatic, the Italian city-states - successors. Then they'll explain why sovereign states became the constitutive elements of the international system. Then they can explain change in the international system in general.

## AN OUTLINE OF THE ARGUMENT

Unit type influences international relations - taking the transhistorical nature of anarchy as a given. 

I contend that the impact of the exogenous variable, trade, led to a variety of social coalitions - the different coalitions and bargains between kings, aristocracy and towns accounting for institutional variation across Europe. These coalitions created different institutions which better met the coalition material interests and ideological perspective - where sovereign states, city-leagues and city-states emerged from feudalism.

In France the social bargain between kings and burghers allowed for recentralization of monarchy, asserting royal sovereignty over the church and nobles. 

Whereas, in Germany the reserve took place where the German king allied with the feudal nobles against the towns. His policy failed, and feudal decentralization occurred and German towns formed independent leagues to protect their interests against the lords. 

In Italy, the failed imperial policy of the German king led to independent communes which gradually developed into city-states. The Italian nobles engaged in urban, mercantile pursuits, hence the feudal-urban dichotomy that characterized Germany failed to appear: Italian towns did not ally with the king.

The resulting realignments in Europe led to variety of new political institutions: the sovereign, territorial state, the city-league, and the city-state.

Not all of these new units were equally efficient - the dynamic of competitive advantage selected out those units that were less effective and less efficient. Sovereign authority proved to be more adept at preventing freeriding, standardizing weights and coinage, and establishing uniform adjudication. Additionally, having the sovereign to coordinate proved an advantage over city-league. Furthermore, territorial sovereignty proved incompatible with non-territorial logics of organisation.

The interaction between internal and external spheres is a two-staged process. Changes in the external milieu lead to domestic shifts in relative power between socio-political actors. These actors realign to form new types of institutions, becoming apart of the external environment which consists of the whole array of institutional possibilities. These arrangements will not be as efficient as the leader. Moreover, some actors need to structure their interactions with others, some forms of organization will be less attractive than others.

We should expect a multiplicity of alternatives to arrive. Institutional change will occur through a two-fold process: a stage of institutional emergence and a subsequent stage of systemic selection.

The account of social evolution proves some justification for the claim that institutional change is an infrequent phenomenon. Change in institutions impose costs, and socio-political actors will be unwilling to experiment unless a serious shock alters alignments.

Change will take the form of a punctuated equilibrium - a dramatic shift along several dimensions in response to an environmental change.

Usually the status quo will prevail and change is marginal.

Chapter 8:

The Victory of the Sovereign State

The economic transformations of the Late Middle Ages inspired individualists to create new forms of organisation in western Europe.

These new forms differed in their degree of internal hierarchy.

I have argued that the economic transformation of the Late Middle Ages inspired individuals to create new forms of organizations in Western Europe.

These new forms differed from one another in their degree of internal hierarchy, and if their authority was demarcated by territorial parameters.

Sovereign states contained a locus of authority - but not absolutism. Even Hobbes found that sovereigns could take the form of parliamentary rule. Even in those states, there existed a final decision-making structure that had no outside interference and gained a monopoly on violence and justice: as though the sovereign state confined itself territorially.

The city-league formed the antithesis of the sovereign, territorial state. Did the final decision making reside with individual cities or with an executive body of the league of towns? Confederation (with the Hansa) made this unclear. Additionally, they were nonterritorial - the leagues lacked borders, integrated for mutual defence and commercial interests.

The city-state formed an intermediate category of institutional structure. With the sovereign, it had in common a demarcation of jurisdiction by fixed borders - the dominant city acting as the focal point for interunit contacts. But the city-state was internally divided, consisting of one city dominating other towns.

These two facets of organization, internal hierarchy and territorial demarcation can be used to examine the systems of rules.

Feudal organization lacked a clear centre and territorial borders. Empire and church claimed final decision-making power but lacked territorial specification of their authority.

The Hansa, Italian city-states and the French state all cued into the new market opportunities created from the transition from local trade to long-distance commerce. Only one from these alternatives survived,

What happened in the three centuries preceding Westphalia? Particular policies, changing fortunes in war, shifting trade routes and idiosyncrasies of rulers all provide explanations, changing location of the herring schools, the stilting of the harbour in Brugues, or the opening of transatlantic routes are presented as explanations for the waning of the Hansa.

But what can we elicit general lessons from their demise - although the descent of the Hanseatic League, or of Venice and Florence, are interesting in their own right, the broader challenging questions is why do they die?

The diminishing fortunes of the Hansa and Venice do not fully explain why city-leagues and city-states, as particular logics of organization should have disappeared.

Sovereigns could credibly also speak on their constituencies, forcing subjects to follow through on agreements reached. Because of their territorial character, states were compatible with one another - jurisdictions specified through agreements on fixed borders.

Also, institutional selection occurred by mimicry and exit - attractive institutions were copied by political elites. Societal actors voted with their feet - leaving institutions not to their liking.


## THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION: DARWINIAN SELECTION BY WAR

For some, it occurs through war - those less able to defend themselves are annihilated.

One body of literature studied is hegemonic rivalry literature - arguing that dominant actors in the system are periodically challenged and defeated, with Spain giving way to the Netherlands and England.

But it focuses on different issues: on rank order change,  or systemic change.

Despite the fact that this and long-cycle literature pay no attention to the type of competing units, we could see whether their explanation might also hold true for competition between different forms of organizations.

Some variants:
1. Compares sovereigns to feudal mode of organization where sovereigns can raise more revenue and troops ... but city-leagues and city-states were also superior. The Hansa could raise troops and equip large fleets against Denmark, England and Holland.
2. Compares the sovereign state to its synchronic rival and argues that the state surpassed city-leagues and city-states because of  command of more territory and population - but doesn't take into account of scenarios like the Dutch (of about 1.5 million) becoming leading powers of the international system of the early sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

Another puzzle is how small sovereign states continued to survive - the continued existence of small German principalities. Why had the Hansa disappeared whereas some of the towns had been members continued as independent actors in the international system?

The author argues that success lies in the particular institutional makeup of different forms of organization.

Warfare is an indicator - the organizational skills and training could assist but *also* the organizational structure, wherein sovereign states could raise more money than their rivals.

The long term of these effects were weighed by actors as we will see.

## ADVANTAGES OF SOVEREIGN TERRITORIALITY OVER THE CONFEDERATED CITY-LEAGUE

Selection operates in three ways:
1. Darwinism survival of the fittest
2. Mutual empowerment (where certain sovereign actors had reasons to prefer systems of rules elsewhere, limiting opportunities for others)
3. Deliberate mimicry and exit where Political elites copy forms they percieve as successful.

#### STANDARDIZATION AND CERTITUDE

One advantage was the existence of an actor who could tackle the legacies of feudal particularism - a vested interest in rationalizing the overall economy because it led to higher revenue and military capacity.

One of these barriers was lack of standardization - medieval measures were of many. This sprang from seigneurial control over measurements where many lords had taken over the rights to issue measurements, and were reluctant to give that up (as they could sell scales) and payments came in-kind, and could be manipulated. Lordly monopoly over the legal measures and scales provided a means for social control.

Also, measurements were very representation, reflecting human body parts - which was not consistent.

Additionaly, some authorities were competent in setting standards and others didn't.

The Hansa certainly didn't, with the league leaving autonomy to the towns and with many towns using their own measurements. They tried to induce standardization by requiring the quarters to follow the measurements of the dominant town of that group but it was little avail.

Enforcement of this rested with muncipal counsils but they were dominated by the very merchants responsible for said violations. The German cities lacked a sovereign authority who could exercise such justice.

In France, kings tried to standardize measures (Charles IX, Henry III, Louis XIV) but it met opposition from the old members of the bourgeois: clergy and nobles who opposed this loss of control.

Merchants and traders preferred more authority to the king rather than less - the Cahiers de Dolerances, letters of grievance sent to the court indicate that people thought the only authority that could end this was the French King. He only managed to install methods of converting measures.

They also had to contend with large assortments of coinage - transaction costs.

The French state fared better than the Hansa in centralizing the minting of the coin. The league didn't as other towns minted their own, and many others adopted different standards - dated from the decline of the Holy Roman Empire. During the Roman Empire and the Carolingian period, the issuage of coinage occured only under strict supervision.

The German emperor tried to maintain control but it was impossible: coinage passed to the dukes, counts and towns. By the sixteenth century, there was roughly 2,500 local and regional authorities.

The diversity had two consequences: First, merchants and tax collectors had to develop some way of comparing different currencies: the Hanseatic merchants had to contend with Lubeck, Pomeranian, Prussian marks and so on. Second, the value of the coin vary depending on its regional place of origin.

In France, coinage became regulated by the king - Louis IX decreed that in 1265 that royal coin should only be good throughout the realm.

One might consider that increased hierarchy has a negative consequence, leading to debasement for revenue but continued debasement would lead to a lack of confidence and raise the ire of merchants. Therein, the French king had an interest in establishing exchange rates to prevent a flight from occurring.

Likewise, the French centralized the legal system more than the Hansa, as the Hansa had a variety of legal codes on the muncipal level. Furthermore, the Hansa did not have any formalized system for determining whether particular issues called for municipal, regional or Hanseatic decisions as due to an absence of a formal constitution for much of their existence.

The Hansa feared doing this as they thought that this would prompt states to cut deals with towns and encourage free-riding.

In France, the kings underwent the right of adjudication - transforming acient rights into a factual exercise of royal power. Louis IX outlawed trial by combat in 1258, and kings enforced property rights.

They also institutionalized the means of raising revenue - large taxes being standardized on the Royal Taille and teh Gabelle (the salt tax).

The ad hoc nature of Hanseatic revenue precluded business certitude. The incidental tolls and customers ... duplicated the very problem that feudalism had previously posed for mercantile pursuits.

To sum up, the Hansa were less efficient in reducing transaction costs and providing collective goods than the sovereign state - not managing to provide standardization of weights, enforce centralized justice, establish a system of coinage or establish means of raising revenue for a fund.

### PREVENTING FREERIDING AND THE KING AS PUBLIC ACTOR

The confederated nature of the Hansa led to freeriding and defection - there were always incentive to disavow the edicts of the diet: defection from international agreements (engaging in piracy) led to the deterioration of relations with trading partners. The gains went to the towns, but the costs were borne by the entire Hansa. Although there was means of dealing with defectors, the most serious was exclusion ... enforcement still required detection of the perpetrator.

Such defection included reneging on contributions to military campaigns and individual bargaining with non-Hanseatics. When the Wend towns foughts the Danish in the 1420s, members of the Saxon group agreed to send help. However, they procrastinated in sneding troops until Lubeck had effectively defeated the Danes by itself.
In economic matters, towns such as Hamburg and Elbing were too willing to defect from Hansa stipulations that no privileges were to be granted to English traders using the Hansa port. It finally withdrew these privileges when threatened with exclusion form the Hansa. Elbing was eager to give England a base in Prussia - Danzig became a port in exchange for corn and flax.

The effect of this was the erosion of the Hanseatic trade hegemony.

Defection and freeriding in the Hanseatic League were driven by mutual distrust between the towns and the decentralized institutional arrangements of the Hansa. Although the league had towns ... that could sometimes override collective action problems, the Prussian towns ... distrusted the treaty that the Wend towns, primarily Hamburg, Bremen, and Lubeck had signed with the Danish king in 1435.

Sovereign actors capitalized on this mutual distrust: the Danish king only recognized the treaty for ships flying the flag of the Wendish town, in the hopes of creating a rift.

The king exacted tolls on the Prussian ships that crossed through the Sound.
England was eager to close deals with individual Hansa towns and thus circumvent the protectionism of the entire league.
When obstructed from access to Bruges, where the Hansa had a major trading office, the English moved their trade to Antwerp which was a relay station for trade with Cologne.

The centralized role that the general Hansetag might have played was further eroded by the regional Tage. Although the regional Tage represented one way of coordinating policy in a more manageable geographical mmanner, regional interests tended to erode the general policy of the league.

In France, by contrast, the interests of the subjects of the realm and the interests of the king largely coincided. What was good fo France was good for the royal coffers.

This is most clear in the activist policies of the French Crown from the later fifteenth century on through the mercantilist era ... Louis XI is thus regarded as "father French mercantilism". He tried to standardize measures, attract foreign craftsmen, and protect domestic industry. In the sixteenth century, the French Crown also engaged in saltpeter mining and industry that was relevant for the manufacture of munitions - the crown standardizing measures, attracting foreign craftsmen, and protecting domestic industry.

By seventeenth century, mercantilism had come into full swing with Colbert's policies - the crown regulated the movement of bullion, reduced imports and fostered internal efficiency by reducing the large number of tolls, improving land transport.

Notably, defense became defense of the realm - the standing army became an instrument of the state rather than an instrument for the defense of the king's property.

The development of the king as protector of the realm was closely tied to the dissociation of the realm and the royal domain. For the Franks, the state belonged to him. With the later Capetians the royal domain ... became an unalienable entity. Hence the argument that the English king could not acquire part of France even if the French king so wished.

The transition from royal domain to the public realm, the quality and function of the king changed.

The king had two bodies: what happened to the individual did not affect the crown. It was increasingly grounded in Roman law, wherein the king was the fountain of law. The king is a public persona, expected to consider all issues with regard to the well-being of the res publica.

This theory was especially articulated in England, similar ideas took root in France - Louis VII argued magnates owed service to the crown, Augustus asked for military support for defence of the king.

There were reasons to believe supporting the king = supporting the realm.
The king benefited from welfare of the state.

In short, territorial rulers were recognised as political entrepreneurs who had vested interests in decreasing feudal economies.

Standardizing coinage, reducing weight and measures, creating legal certitude, reducing transaction and information costs, internal hiearchy suited to control free riding and defection, less ability to wage war.

Hansa were less able to wage type of war that the French state could've, organisational flaws of the Hanseatic League.

Demise was long and protracted. There was no decisive battle that sealed its fate, decline was relative and not absolute. Tonnage of hanseatic shipping was 50% higher than 1600, lost ground relative to the dutch who by 1600 had a fleet 3x the tonnage of the Hansa. There was an economic revival after 1550 and the Hansa tried to remedy some of it through yearly assessment and a constitution in 1557.

## Selection by Mutual Empowerment: Credible Commitments and Territorial Jurisdiction

International exchange requires a modicum of domestic stability, expectation that each will adhere to the terms of the agreement. Internal stability is needed to guarantee that the partner can commit the individuals on whose behalf they're negotiating.

Hanseatic diet did not specify whom it was negotiating for, an unattractive partner to international agreements. For example:

The Merchant Adventurers, an English association of traders, argued in 1551 that privileges for the Hansa should be rescinded because "none of their charters named particular individuals or towns so that there was no way of knowing who ought to enjoy the pretended privileges.

This was also perceived to be greatly detrimental to the king, and the Merchant Adventurers claimed that the crown lost 17,000 pounds sterling in customs duties because nonleague members enjoyed league privileges

One of the primary demands of the Privy Council in the negotiations of 1560 ... Hansa provide list ... by 1589 the problem still was not resolved ... feared such a list would (to the English) make individual towns the target of English encroachment. A state might provide benefits to individual towns and thus encourage their defection or conversely, it might impose costs on some other.

The Hansa furthermore argued that it could not be held responsible for infringements of treaties by individual towns. Privileges were obtained for all its members, and thus acted as a legal body, it suspended such uniform legal status when costs were imposed.

The Hanseatic diet absolved itself from responsibility for towns that violated agreements, yet at the same time it argued that benefits negotiated by representatives of the Hansa should fall to all members.

But Agreements were negotiated and ratified with the Hanseatic diet, but enforcement depended on the further ratification of the individual town council.

Hansa was not able to prevent individual towns from defecting from agreements once they had been reached, which drove the trade wars between them and the English.

Territorial lords were able to gain concessions by negotiating with individual towns directly.

When England obtained privileges from Hamburg, Hamburg claimed to be a free city "which had the right to adopt any policy." In addition, this lack of committed membership highly complicated the nature of warfare. If a state went to war with the Hansa, this did not automatically mean that one was at war with all the Hansa members.

In sovereign states, by contrast, the responsibility for redress of violations by subjects was put on the shoulders of the sovereigns.

Sovereign authorities thus took it upon themselves to regulate trade.

When a merchant had been defrauded by an alien, it was standard practice to take revenge, by violent means.

Sovereigns, however, started to create focal points for institutionalized redress and their subjects would benefit, or be punished if they violated agreements.

Sovereign authorities provided specific loci of authority through which cooperation could be organized.

There were consequences of the Hansa of not committing:
Because the league could not control defection, it could not credibly consign itself to long-run agreements with joint gain.
Institutions originate where repetitive behaviour occurs between two actors. The more this repetition occurs, the more the actors expect a typical pattern of behaviour from the other.

In short, political elites should prefer systems of rule in their environment that can commit their members.

## MARKET VERSUS TERRITORIAL STATE

The two states are driven by different principles.

Hansa resembled imperial form - lacked authority of control, shared objective of having big political control over its sphere of economic interactions.

Sovereign states, delimited by explicit territorial parameters. Their claim to authority is limited by their recognition that authority only extends to their border. States are logically predisposed to extend political control to other areas. Sovereignty is based on the principle of juridical equality.

Imperial modes ... did not recognize formal borders. Hansa did not limit its political authority by formal borders ... tried to extend its control transterritorially ... seek special privileges (in non Hansa town) and rights of jurisdiction.

League membership included towns in sovereign states, crosscutting jurisdiction. Town could be subject to the territorial lord, and to that of the league.

The Hansa did not fit well:  especially worrying at the Peace of Westphalia where the league sought repressentation.

Towns were only consulted on the issue of repayments. Nonterritorial logic did not mesh with the state system.

Why would the independent imperial elite gain standing ... if the issue of hanseatic recognition was not simply a matter of material resources?

The individual cities certainly did not have more resources than the league.
Imperial cities could be regarded as small states.
Individual towns could participate in peace treaties.
the issue was whether the league as an organizations of town could participate

## Selection by Directed Adaptation: Mimicry and Exit

Students of organization theory and scholars of IR have vexed by a question: why are institutions similar, or at least why do they become similar over time?

One explanation suggests that institutional isomorphism occurs through competitive pressures and non-competitive mechanisms.

The latter process explains how less efficient organizations can continue to persist - mechanisms of mutual empowerment.

The second process consists of agent-driven choices - copying institutions perceived to be important.

It enables elites to be recognized as equals within the state system.

In a material sense, they are suited to pursue long-run gains through treatises. From an ideological perspective, they are perceived as the equals of the leaders.
Social actors vote with feet - exiting less successful system, switching loyalties.

German lordships copy the institutional makeup, establishing hierarchical control within their borders.

Weights and coinage were increasingly standardized and princely adjudication became the norm.

These lordships became increasingly like miniature sovereign states.

There were advantages to sovereign state-hood.

Externally, states could ... commit themselves and engage in long-run iterative relations.

As the advantage swung in favour of these states, only similar forms of organizations were recognized.

Domestically sovereigns proved to be better at reducing transaction costs and providing for collective goods, so sovereign states managed to raise more revenue than their alternatives.

All these factors suggested that sovereign statehood was the preferable form of organization. The Hansa similarly tried to copy institutional forms that were more successful - 16th century, pursuing closer co-op with the emperor to create the royal-urban alliance that had faltered.

The Hansa entertained the idea of forming a tight association incorporating all German cities or even forming a government along the lines of the Dutch Republic - preventing defection. This idea failed because of town's disparate interest.

Towns defected from the league perceiving the benefits of territorial entities. They allied with local lords, agreeing with the princes to construct states made up of contiguous territories. The tasks of organizing long-distance commerce were increasingly taken over by states and their consular services.

Some Hansa towns simply failed to appear - towns were incorporated within the borders of existing sovereign states or became small territorial states in their own right.

## FRAGMENTED SOVEREIGNTY IN THE ITALIAN CITY-STATES

The Hansa lacked both two specific traits that sovereign states had: external, territorial definition and internal hierarchy.

The city-state demarcated itself externally from other authorities by territorial borders. Internally ... it lacked a clear sovereign. Its jurisdiction over the subject towns was always contested. Sovereignty ... was fragmented.

## Darwinian Selection: The Consequences of Contested Sovereignty

Medieval commerce was bedeviled by a variety of measures, weights and coins, irrational means of trial.

This was combatted internally by the king, who tried to become the external focal point for transnational interactions.

Unlike in the sovereign state, hierarchy in the Italian city-state was ambigious as "power inside the city-state was always being challenged from within" - resembling the city-league.

This fermentation within the Italian cities and city-states left them in a disadvantageous position through their territorial counterparts in rationalizing their economies.

The lack of a sovereign authority was due to:

First:
The formation of the Italian state occurred through annexation of other towns by dominant cities
All these towns had considerable autonomy before and did not relinquish their local autonomy before such incorporation - large responsibilities were left to cities - a distribution of power that some historians have called a diarchy. From the angle of the dominant city, subject cities were looked upon as vanquished areas at the disposal of the victor - look at Venice and its dominions.
This attitude and lack of integration are evident in the slow extension of citizenship by the dominant city to its subject towns and rural areas.

Second:
Hierarchy of authority was less pronounced due to endemic factionalism - fluctuating between despotic, oligarchical and democratic regimes using government to serve its ends.
Various factions claimed the legitimate right to exercise violence. In France by contrast, the king became the common provider of protection.
In the previous discussion, the Hansa was less successful in rationalizing economy, preventing defection, providing for collective goods and reducing transaction costs.
Standardization of weights, measures and coinage seem to have come relatively late to the Italian city-states. Subject towns had exercised these rights and were unwilling to give up their control. They raised their revenue, levied their own custom duties, making economic integration hard.

The subject cities, due to their inferior status, were eager to defect when such an opportunity arose.

In short, city-states looked like city-leagues, the absence of a central actor who had incentives to further the overall interest of the city-state.
The dominant town exploited the subject cities.
Conversely, subject towns judiciously guarded their autonomy and were willing to defect from the city state whenever the opportunity presented itself, making rationalization and standardization come very slow to Italian city-states.

## Mutual Empowerment: Fixed Boundaries and Transnational Focal Point

City-states behaved no differently in international affairs than sovereign, territorial states - their authority was bound by specific territorial parameters, participating as equals with states. Dominant Italian actors recognized the status quo and made a list idenitfying which towns were allies.

The dominant city monopolized the foreign relations of the subject town - providing a clear focal point for negotiations.

With the league, it was ambigious whether individual towns or Hanseatic Diet were most appropriate channels for diplomacy.

City-states therefore survived a long time in the state system - Venice, German principalities, Italian city-states. A result of their empowerment as equivalent actors on the international scene because of their external similarity to sovereign, territorial states.

## Institutional Mimicry and Exit

The benefit of sovereign authority were not lost on Italian rulers.

The success of these initial efforts - regulating the manufacture of goods, metal content of coins and so on - is unclear as economically these subject cities declined.

Only leading citizens of subject towns obtained citizenship and internal barriers remained.

There had been little progress in eliminating economic localism.

The Venetian government remained locked in a system in which only noble families who had centuries before been entered into the Gold Book were allowed to participate.

Five families from mainland gained influence. Administration became privilege of nobleman.

Commoners and lesser nobles had little access and little development of the notion of a sovereign.

Implications are yet to be uncovered: despite this, coinage was stable, unclear how far mainland economies were sacrificed.

It is clear that Venice never integrated the Terra Ferma. Many city-states failed. They clung to their historically developed, local and particularistic self-rule.

Continued local particularism and turn from mercantile pursuit to landed interests brought Italian economy full circle - refeudalization occurred, nobility was always involved in Italian commerce whereas in NW Europe the Bourgeoise had remained separated from aristocratic mode of life.

The turn to landed pursuits accompanied by considerable autonomy bbecame a reality.

Only after the 2nd half of 18th century did centralization achieve success - intellectuals looked to foreign rulers and argued that only princes could be effective agents of reform.

In summary, the city-states slowly transformed themselves into sovereign, territorial states.

Arguably city-states, unlike city-leagues, were compatible with a system of sovereign states - they acknowledged territorial delimitation of their political control and final locus of external interactions.

Because of their imperfect territorial integration and absence of a fully articulated sovereign authority, they proved to be less competitive,

Attempts were made to transform city-states from a system in which dominant cities exploited their subject territories to one that was territorially integrated.

## THE GENERAL NATURE OF INSTITUTIONAL SELECTION

War was not the selective mechanism.

Warfare did not end the Hanseatic League or the Italian city-states.
One cannot argue Spanish and French invasions ended city-states.

Success in war indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of types of organization - some forms of organizations are superior. Sovereign states were better in raising revenue and larger numbers of troops. War did not work as an evolutionary process that selected among types of units.

The ability to wage war needs to be explained:
I have suggested that size and population are at best imperfect predictors of military power ... neglects the rise of Portugal and the Netherlands which
were no larger in terms of territory or population (to Italy)

The ability to wage war was a function of institutional arrangements
Those of freeriding and factionalism had problems reducing transaction costs and rationalizing their economies.

Selection was thus partially driven by competitive efficiency. It also advanced ... by the process of mutual empowerment.

Sovereign actors only recognized particular types of actors ... because the Hanseatic system of rule proved to be less incompatible with that of territorially defined states ... it was not legit player in IR.

They also engaged in institutional learning - corresponding with their belief systems, and choosing systems that proved better than others, weeding out the 'lesser ones' - systems of rule that could make credible commitments and systems that would not encroach upon one's own jurisdiction.

The institutionalization of a system of sovereign states imposed a certain non-hierarchical order on transnational interactions.

That said, evolution is adaptation, not progress - not teleological, only developing the 'most competitively efficient' institution.
Selection occurs after a broad environment shift.
The selective process might have emerged between city-states and city-leagues would've occurred if the institutional form of the sovereign state did not emerge.

# Conclusion

On the one hand, the emergence of sovereign states had direct consequences for the other types of institutional arrangements in the system. The system selected out those types of units that were, competitively speaking, less efficient.

At the same time, sovereign states preferred similar modes of organization in their environment. Actors intentionally created a system of sovereign, territorial states. They preferred a system that divided the sphere of cultural and economic interaction into territorial parcels with clear hierarchical authorities.

In the first phase, variety of units form elements of a system, transforming it to a network of similar actors.
