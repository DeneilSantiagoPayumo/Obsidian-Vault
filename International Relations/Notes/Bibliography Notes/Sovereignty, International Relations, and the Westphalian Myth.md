This author argues that the discipline theorizes against a backdrop of the path that is not real - the accepted narrative about Westphalia is a myth.

First section (which I will mostly skip) - what this narrative says about the Thirty Years' War
Second section - the link between 1648 and the creation of a new, sovereignty-based international system
Third section - the holy roman empire.

The concept of "Westphalia" is really a product of the nineteenth and twentieth century fixation on the conception of sovereignty.

How has the ideology of sovereignty hampered the development of IR theory?

252 People believe the Thirty Years' War was a struggle between two main parties - the universalist actors: the emperor and the Spanish King, and the "particularist" actors, like Denmark, actors that reject imperia overlordship and the authority of the Pope, upholding the rights of all states to full independence.

Interpretation is dubious - hinge on the notion that the Habsburg were a threat to the "nascent" individual states - most of the states have been in question, neither their survival or their independence was at stake in this war.

## The original Bohemian crisis

253 The crisis truly broke out because the Habsburgs were weak.
Power was shared - the system of government in central Europe was "dualist" with power shared between the princes and the notables of the realm, known as the estates.

To consolidate those gains, the radicals among the Bohemian estates initiated an uprising that side-lined the pro-Habsburg "doves" and eliminated any power of the Habsburg-held crown.

The Habsburg position in central Europe was on the brink of collapse - twice in 1619 did rebel troops reach the suburbs of Vienna ... the Spanish king [found it difficult] to put his weight behind Ferdinand.

German princes distanced themselves from Frederick. His collusion with the rebels against their legit rulers alienated fellow princes, and he was expected to take advantage of the religious dimension of the conflict and use his position as head of the Union to defend his "ill-gotten" royal title.

254 The electoral college elected Ferdinand emperor in August 1619, unanimously.

He failed to obtain the British and Dutch support on what he had counted - despite Frederick's position as leader, the Union accepted a nonaggression pact with the Catholic League, enabling the League to assist Ferdinand against the elector palatine. The Union then fell apart, and Ferdinand reconquered the Bohemian capital in November 1620 and drove Frederick into exile.

Habsburgs preserved their position in central Europe, Ferdinand emerged from the crisis a diminished figure - the power of that office was limited and subject to constitutional checks and balances, forced to buy their support

### The Danish Bid for Expansion and the Sudden Rise and Decline of Habsburg Hegemony

Key actors regarded Habsburg power as less threatening than the prospect of its collapse. This only changed in the second Danish phase of the war.
The Spanish branch of the Habsburg dynasty was more powerful but it did not threaten the independence of the other actors.

255 In the Spanish-Dutch conflict, the Dutch were well able to hold their own - a 12 year truce passed, and the Dutch continued to harass the Spanish colonies and trade with them. The Spanish had few illusions that Dutch independence could be undone.

Dutch willingness to enable the Spanish emboldened the Danish king to prepare a military strike against troops of the Catholic League who remained garrisoned.

The principalities in question were bishopries whose incumbents had the same rights as secular princes of the empire except that their position was not hereditary. They were elected for life by the cathedral chapters.

Canons would turn Protestant and ... see some member of a Protestant dynasty who they hoped would protect them, or who bribed or bullied them.

The problem of critical mass explains the importance of who would secure control of the north German bishopries - none understood it better than the Protestant Danish kings.

256 Alberecht von Wallenstein - a new rich Bohemian nobleman who offered the emperor and army which we would initially raise and pay for himself. The court accepted this, the Danish king leading an army to secure the reinstatement of Frederick.

As a result, N Germany found itself under military control of the emperor; but Habsburg archives had yielded no evidence that he would make himself 'master of Germany'

Having deposed the existing dynasty for supporting the Danish king, in 1628 Ferdinand made Wallenstein duke of Mecklenburg - a move that caused strong antagonism ... rattled by this transferal of a Protestant principality to a Catholic by a stroke of the pen. This Edict of Restitution - the re-catholicization of all church assets that had passed into Protestant hands, was applied to the whole empire.

257 This edict was aimed at strengthening the empire, potentially religious, or reverse the continual decline in the number of Catholic ecclesiastical princes of the empire.
Any gain for the emperor was outweighed by the political cost of the measure - perhaps its main motive was genuinely religious

The electoral college levelled its anger at Ferdinand when it had met with him at Regensburg, an emperor expected the college to elect his own successor, he had a strong stake in maintaining relations - but the college here denied his request for his eldest son to be emperor-designate. They also demanded his dismiss his unpopular generalissimo along with 3/4 of this troops

The college told the emperor to withdraw from Italy.

Wallenstein was removed from office and his army was disbanded. He accepted a peace agreement with France while he was still at Regensburg.

### The Swedish Bid for Expansion and the French Attempt to break Habsburg Power

258 Sweden and French crowns saw it as a means to enhance their own positions in Europe by eroding that of the Habsburg.

King Gustaf Adolf of Sweden decided to take his turn to attack the emperor to protect Germany from Habsburg oppression in general and the Edict of Restitution in particular.

The invasion at first was hampered by financial difficulties and a disinclination by Protestant princes to rally around their self-appointed saviour.

It is ironic that Gustaf Adolf invaded the empire for the stated purpose of removing the threat posed by the emperor just when the electoral college stripped Ferdinand of much of his military power.

After the decisive Swedish defeat of 1634, with Adolf and Wallenstein dead, the emperor and Protestant elector of Saxony reached an agreement - to accede to this Peace of Prague.

If that settlement went through, the peace would have left the constitution of the empire unchanged. The electoral college was pleased with Ferdinand to proceed in 1636.

259 Then the French re-entered the war ... draining Habsburg resources.

To increase Spanish dependence ... Richelieu was anxious to maintain military pressure on Spain. ... Richelieu's motive was to prevent Ferdinand from being assistance to the Spanish king now that Denmark had quit the war.

### Summary
259 This is a very simplified account, but it demonstrates the complexity of such. The Habsburg did not want this war and did not threaten the independence of other actors, least of all outside the empire - once the war had begun, what sustained it was expansionist aggression by other actors.

Danish King believed the forces of counterreformation might het hold of the north German bishoprics before he did.
The case of Gustaf Adolf, perhaps he intervened in Germany as of the fear that the emperor would threaten Swedish domination of the Baltic.

This explanation does not account for the huge scale of the Swedish operations in the empire.

There is no ambiguity regarding Richelieu's intentions - he wanted to ruin the house of Austria completely ... profit from its dis-membership ... make France ... the most powerful in Europe.

## 1648: Peace, Propaganda, and the (Non-)issue of Sovereignty

Traditional interpretation is not correct if it's true that the war was not fought to ward off a threat to the independence of other European actors. Scholars see the peace has having been concerned with the issue of sovereignty ... the need to reorder the European system and give it new rules.

... the author goes through some fairly same-y theories about IR politics.

262

### War and Propapganda

Never before or during the war was the emperor in a position to threaten the long-established independence of actors outside the Holy Roman empire.

The war can be seen as a jostling for power among major European actors - the emperor was the notional secular head of Christian society, conceived of as a single hierarchy ... a major power struggle among dynastic actors could not but become a jostling for the top of the pyramid.

The Habsburgs had been the most obvious contender for top rank in Christian society, having tradition and legitimacy on their side. Their combined dominions were extensive, acquired through largely nonviolent means such as marriage: contrary to what was supposed, at that time conquest was regarded as a dubious title to possession.

263 By contrast, the French and Swedish crowns bought power to the struggle than legitimacy - Adolf having generous French subsidies and a great ideology.

Neither the Swedes nor the French suffered from Habsburg aggression in their own territory, they could challenge them ... concerned with rank and thus prestige and legitimacy.

The French and Swedish crown justified their intervention in the German war by claiming the princes of the empire were in danger of being subjugated by the emperor, that strengthening the Habsburg position would threaten actors outside the empire as well.

### The Peace Treaties and the Problem of Sovereignty: Some Clarification

266 The standard account of the peace ultimately reflects wartime anti-Habsburg propaganda - the treaties rather deal with practicalities, the settlement contains nothing of the sort. It is silent on issue of sovereignty or the independence of European actors.

The treaties that it produced were not a pan-European charter - the Peace of Westphalia was only an agreement between three parties, two treaties signed on 24 October 1648 - one between the Holy Roman Empire and king of France (Treaty of Munster) and the Treaty of Osnabruck (holy Roman empire and Queen of Sweden).

267 French and Swedish people took their independence for granted, no one questioned that independence so why would they want it confirmed? It is because of the arbitrary habit of regarding 1648 as a milestone in the evolution of sovereignty that this concept is projected into the settlement.

The treaties confirm nothing about their "sovereignty" or anybody else.

The complete autonomy of Switzerland was uncontroversial in practice and the Swiss were reluctant to have anything to do with the peace congress.

Both terms were traditional and neither signifies sovereignty in the modern sense - an author called Egger concedes that most Swiss "had not realized that Switzerland had become a sovereign state independent of the empire." but it's explanation is that it had indeed not: Swiss made references to the Holy Roman empire in oath of citizenship.

268 The Dutch autonomy was unquestioned. What interested them was the recognition of their independence by Spain.

### Summary

In this section the traditional account of Westphalia is flawed.

## The Holy Roman Empire from an IR perspective

### A Cooperative Legal Order of Non-Sovereign Autonomous Entities: The Concept of Landeshoheit

270 The Peace of Westphalia created a system of mutual relations among autonomous political units that was precisely not based on the concept of sovereignty. Understanding this alternative model requires an analysis of the constitution of the empirer.

Put simply, the 1648 peace was the outcome of the breakdown of the Augsburg religious peace of 1555 - clarified other aspects of the constitution but abstained from innovating.

Compared to the religious-political deadlock, it emerged from the peace congress unchanged in its conception, but in a better working condition. The way that the Peace was discussed implies that the empire was much more divided after 1648 than before 1618, that the role of emperor was reduced by the peace.

271 Even before 1618, the empire was not a unitary state and the constitution limited the emperor's role.

The emperor exercised direct jurisdiction only over his own dynastic lands, but retained a pivotal role in the politics of the empire - over the Reichstag.

The Reichstag was competent enough to deal with any matters of concern, composed of three councils - the electoral college comprising those princes who were entitled to elect the emperor.

There were many votes. In practice, the electoral and princely delegates always agreed with each other.

272 The empire had no central government, it was a regime. The estates of the empire did the actual governing - territorial jurisdiction: the autonomy of the estates was limited, externally through the laws of the empire and internally through the constitutional arrangements within the various territories.

The limitations imposed may be illustrated by examples from the Peace of Westphalia - it is asserted that with this peace, a ruler could determine the religion of his or her subjects. On the contrary, the cuius regio-system established by the Peace of Augsburg proved destabilizing and unworkable. The 164 treaties laid down that each part of the empire would be frozen, that the Peace of Westphalia deprived the princes and free cities any authority to determine the religious affiliation of their lands, guaranteeing private exercise of any recognized denomination and mandated a certain amount of legal protection.

273 Another element that is interpreted wrongly is making estates of the empire "sovereign" is the right to conclude alliances with foreign actors: the estates always had this right.

### A System of Juridical control

Not much detail added here:
Peace of Westphalia proved half the judges Protestants, calling for fifty judges. Some discussion that will be touched upon later.

### The Holy Roman Empire as Part of the European System

The post-1648 Holy Roman Empire and the seventeenth and eighteenth-century European empire do not represent mutually exclusive paradigms but are part of a spectrum.

277 IR scholars have assumed that sovereignty presupposed the ability of actors to defend themselves against each other ... according to [[Charles Tilly]], "until recently only those states that survived that held their own with other states" (63).

This power-political view has been criticized. John Gerard Ruggie has pointed out that the transition to the early modern period brought changes.

278 It has allowed many weak actors to subsist while more powerful actors disappeared. The real issue was not power but legitimacy.

[[The Sovereign State and Its Competitors|Hendrik Spruyt]] argues against the "war making" theory of the evolution of the states system put forward by Tilly, arguing that medieval competitors of territorial actors were not overcome militarily, instead that it is a process brought by social actors and mutual empowerment - institutional mimicry (30-33).

War making played a big role, but it's worth pointing out that even before the twentieth century European actors hardly ever ceased to exist because of military defeat - no European actors destroyed because of an inability to defend themselves.

The gradual obsolescence led the consolidation of actors at the sub-royal level, whereas in other countries power gravitated toward the crown at the expense of lesser actors.

Even in the latter case, this process of centralization could be accompanied by warfare between the crown and certain great nobles, warfare by itself did not extinguish any actors.

Even though the European system at large was really a regime, sovereignty was not based on power but mutual convention - military power was a conspicuous attribute of some but not all actors of the system, and its use was built into the regime in which they took part as something that was acceptable if not carried too far.

279 Powerful actors tended to fight each other, not weaker actors.

If the European system can be called a loose, informal regime, the empire was essentially a more developed regime with more elaborate institutions, providing a system of governance for matters of common interest while leaving internal government to each of the participating actors individually.

The actors in this system ... remained free agents in the sense that there was little to prevent them from leaving the empire had they been determined to do so. even the most powerful, like the king of Prussia never contemplated leaving - for the advantageous of legitimacy and recognition of status and possessions that membership bestowed is too high, and breaking the link would've made it necessary to gain recognition of the new status thus established afresh.

These systems displayed social behaviour, not behaviour intended to survive - society were not generally seen as coextensive.

### Summary

There is more to IR than dealings between sovereign actors.

A fixation on sovereignty and the dubious view of sovereignty as based on military capability have created a narrow perception of international political phenomena, unable to deal with the ideas of the Holy Roman empire.

## Overall conclusion: Sovereignty and IR Theory

The concept of sovereignty was honed by modern international lawyers, technological progress and so on. The process of which a single society of medieval Europe evolved into neatly divided, sovereign territorial states was gradual - the significant transition occurred with the French Revolution and industrialization, not the Peace of Westphalia.


Only in this kind of system could the concept of sovereignty acquire its present meaning - the integrating power of the individual brought a near congruence between state and society.

What goes unnoticed is the historically exceptional and transitory character of this situation - sovereignty has been a positive ring, and in politics, historians are eager to project this concept to the past.


Some other things:
David Boucher - "provided the foundation for, and gave formal recognition to, the modern states system in Europe"
Seyom Brown spoke of "Westphalian principles", arguing that "the government of each country is unequivocally sovereign within its territorial jurisdiction and (20 countries shall not interfere in each other's domestic affairs."
