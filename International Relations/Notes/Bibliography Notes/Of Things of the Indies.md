Receptivity - in the name of discussing the spectrum of acceptance and nonacceptance of a European presence and European cultural elements by native acceptance.

Both resistance and receptivity used in similar contexts are used in this context - they look at a process of interaction between those arriving and those already there and ask only what the indigenous group is willing or equipped to accept from the new group.

Resistance of all kinds is least in the first group which shared an amazing number of characteristics with early modern European peoples.

(page 305)

Interactions between Europeans and indigenous people in the Western Hemisphere was not fully symmetrical. One group had more power, one not. One group was situated, one was not. Even receptivity and resistance are to be found on the European side.

Here is a list of what the Spaniards resisted and accepted:
1. The Spaniards and Ports long resisted going to regions which did not have dense populations or obvious wealth.
2. The accepted the sedentary peoples to the extent of leaving them where they were and using the vast majority of their socio-political and economic mechanisms.
3. They accepted indigenous food and housing until they could build European-style equivalents. That said, they'd eat maize or cassava if they can't eat wheat.
4. Even in areas of dense European occupation, wealth and suitability for crops, the Spaniards acquired a taste for indigenous foods - for the Spanish diet continued to be based on the European meats beef and mutton.

306

5. Indigenous mechanisms of permanent and temporary labour became built deeply into the world - every Spanish household had more or less permanent servants and employees coming out of native society.
6. Indigenous words gave a special flavour to the language. All first-generation loans from these languages were nouns but with time verbs appeared.

In the other direction, Spanish was left hardly changed.

307

The reaction of indigenous people to European things depended on the fit of the two groups at various points and in various places as a result of previous centuries of experience.

```ad-example

For example, draft rotary labour was much more highly organized and used lavishly in indigenous societies and was later adapted for the Spaniards.

Additionally, there was a lack of immunities to Old World diseases like smallpox and measles.

We can observe a radical difference in resistance/acceptance across the hemisphere - for many years, you can use a rough broad scheme of fully sedentary, semisedentary and non-sedentary people.

Resistance of all kinds is least in the first group which shared an amazing number of characteristics with early modern European society, greater in the second and maximal in the third.

It is the nature of indigenous society that accounts for the so varying reactions, for all the Europeans were constituted much the same, such as is the Spaniards.

308

It is true that European numbers made a large difference in indigenous reactions. When Europeans come in numbers too small to represent a threat, small bits and pieces of their culture may find acceptance with Cabeza de Vaca's sixteenth-century wanderings in what is now the southern United States and northern Mexico.

Larger numbers and the attempt to occupy the area brought stiff military opposition at some early points. Even larger numbers not only make the question of military resistance as good as irrelevant but through massive daily contract bring about the acceptance in some form of whole complexes of cultural patterns.

Europeans therefore make a crucial difference in the indigenous reaction from one place to another but we must consider that the numerical aspect of their presence is often mainly a function of the nature of the indigenous people. Europeans avoided non-sedentary people wherever and for as long as they could.

309

Conscious or patriotic resistance plays a smaller role than it is imagined to. Lack of acceptance does not mean conscious opposition. The topic needs division into general military action and the developments when groups are reconciled to the European presence.

## Combat

Even this I would be reluctant to call resistance.

With less sedentary people, fighting against Europeans can take on the aspect of attack rather than resistance.

Even where we see full-scale military campaigns with the purpose of keeping Europeans out, most groups were simply thinking of the greatest good and how much independence they could attain. Indigenous solidarity against the Europeans is unheard of.

The indigenous people saw the Europeans as (310) another player on the local scene who may improve the position of one's own group in it.

The Spaniards, when arriving in 1519, came along the Totonacs of the Gulf coast. These people offered no resistance and gave them food and gifts. They negotiated with the arrivals to lessen their dependence on the other local group.

As the Spaniards headed inland they met first sharp military attacks. After losing overwhelmingly, the Tlaxcalans came over with offers of logistic and military help.  They became the ... most faithful collaborators with the Spaniards.

The general lesson is that the second power of a given region will likely become the European's strongest support in the military phase of the conquest.

311

Other ethnic states received the Spaniards with peace and submission.

Then the Spaniards were expelled, and fought a long battle. The leading power of a region will ... offer all the military resistance it can to the arriving Europeans, not as a threat to indigenous civilisations, but as a threat to its own dominance.

Both those who cooperated and resisted assumed that the victorious would demand tribute as the Mexica from other local ethnic states.

"One may ask ... why were they so willing to go over to the Spanish side?"
"I suppose partly on the principle of playing one dominant power against another, and on the belief that a new boss can't be as bad as the old one."

312

The picture in central Mexico is one we found everywhere - that any indigenous confederation or empire was a agglomeration of groups which were ethnically separate, structurally to a large extent self-governing, aware of earlier independence, and ready to consider regaining it.

Tenochtitlan had not transcended the system of being a single altepetl receiving tribute from a host of others built exactly like itself. It had frequently married members of its own dynasty to members of local dynasty in the expectation that some of the children ... would succeed to the local thrones.

There tended to be a Mexica and an anti-Mexica party in the central Mexican altepetl. As resistance to the Tenochtitlan took place, many pretenders to the rulership ... and even some actual rulers ...

313

Went to join it.

Something similar must've happened in the commercial network which was as important to the creation of Tenochtitlan dominance, and an Aztec Empire as actual conquest and dynastic intermarriage.

The only way it could've gained its huge size is through its spontaneous emigration of traders and producers, the markets of Tenochtitlan and its Mexica satellite Tlatelolco. My assumption is that many ... who were active in interregional trade ... joined the opposition ... and many others must have sympathized, for to the extent that the capital was not actually blockaded.

These internal fights were not so much between parties with differing attitudes about how to receive the Spaniards as between stronger and weaker parties, the weaker being forced into a position of active opposition to the Spaniards as a banner for dissidents.

The core attitude of the Indigenous was that the Spanish people would've acted the same. It's hard to say who was manipulating whom, especially if the transaction was between the Spaniards and a whole local ethnic state seeking autonomy.

314

In Indigenous accounts, the events in central Mexico prior to the siege of Tenochtitlan assert that Moteuccoma made a number of futile efforts to discourage the Spaniards, and eventually met them peacefully.

Major indigenous groups did not show uniform hostility. This early hesitance was not in itself decisive ... the demands made through the captured ruler quickly aroused resentment and some form of large-scale armed opposition.

315

A striking feature of the scene is that the sedentary people put up armies that did worse than poorer, less numerous, more mobile people.

European superiority showed itself in large battles on level ground.

The sedentary people are not mobile.

The more mobile people did not have to stand and fight. They could melt away almost at will without losing too much and could easily mount surprise counterattacks of various kinds.

They were more skilled in war and had better weapons due to their hunting background.

When conquered, they could not live as before.

316

The difference between the sedentary people and others in positive and negative potential brought on reactions on the part of the latter - the light resistance of the sedentary, their usable resources attracted immigrants that made it easier to overcome resistance. The less sedentary people with small numbers and resources meant they had very little immigrants.

Once someone detached from their setting, they swung around to the acceptance end of the spectrum.

Indigenous slaves brought to Peru learned the Spanish language and way of life ... showing no inclination to join the great Andean rebellion a few years later.

317

### Rebellion

Large-scale rebellions were rare.

What was common was a spontaneous outbreak by the people of one ethnic state in defence of their rights.

These feel more like self-assertations than resistance. They weren't against Spanish sovereignty or Christian religion; they asserted the group's autonomy within that context and rarely spread beyond the confines of a single local group.

315

These outbreaks caused violent actions and most were quickly past sometimes gaining their point but sometimes being put down without repercussions.

They are a part of a larger context involving peaceful cooperation.

Indigenous groups were free to litigate in their own interest. They used lawyers. They brought pressure. Sometimes, tumultos (riots) became fierce leading to the deaths of Spanish and indigenous officers, causing punishment.

Those involved were dissidents acting against the constituted authorities within the community itself, claiming the latter was improperly elected.

319

Many of the people of southern Mesoamerica were not as fully sedentary. They shared many of the characteristics of semisedentary people and were hard to conquer. The process took many years.

Thus the people to north and south were less similar to Europe, more prone to military opposition and later large-scale rebellion.

320

### Normal interaction

The question of what kind of European culture elements indigenous people were prepared to accept and under what conditions - people organized in their own socio-political entities, who quickly accept everything.

In the larger view of this matter, resistance plays a small part. To speak of a sector where that is fairly clear from the beginning (language change) is taught to be impersonal, but it is thought necessary to emphasize how little any patriotic resentment came into play.

321

The Nahutal took only proper names from Spanish, using indigenous vocab to name new things.
During the next hundred years, in 1550-1650, Nahutal took a myriad of words from Spanish. The limits were linguistic. All words borrowed were nouns.

From 1650 onwards, Nahutal opened up to take words other than nouns, to translate idioms and create equivalences between their and Spanish words to add Spanish sounds to its phonology.

322

Really, it resembles a child's acquisition of language. a language-contact sequence appears to have reached universally validity. But there's no rason why a whole process could not occur more quickly.

For that to happen there would have to be massive contact where newcomers were more numerous. A lack of contact or exposure, and few borrowing.

Everything borrowed denoted some new object, practice or concept which the Spaniards brought with them. The line between what was felt as new and what was not ... is far from clear.

323

As we approach the 3rd stage, we reach unconscious resistance where the Nahuas had understood Spanish verbs, and the Nahuas began to change their verb *pia*, "to hold, keep guard" to correspond to Spanish *tener* in meaning, but did not borrow *tener* or any other word.

They even added native verb endings to Spanish words. But they also fastened the infinitive (which they had lacked) and added the said native verb endings to it.

They also added prepositions.

This is driven by increased contact, increased intensity and intimacy between a larger group of Spanish speakers and a smaller group of Nahutal speakers.

324

We know that the Spanish, mestizo and mulatto population was the largest yet.

Further corroboration comes from the nature of things taken into Nahuatl at this time. Loans during stage 2 involved items in familiar categories to the Nahuas.

A great many of the new words in S3 involved many meanings that could already be expressed. The rationale of many stage 3 phenomena cannot be understood until one compares the language and realises there's a large disparity in what they say and how. 

325

The Andean case fails to confirm an analysis that isolation results in more friction and 'slowness' in adding stuff. All the Mesoamerican peoples took to European alphabetic writings quickly.

One could say they mutely resisted ... because they had no analogue.

Peru entered stage 3 even earlier than central Mexico - concentrating where Spanish speakers concentrated.

Change over the postconquest centuries across the board looks like acceptance of European culture elements.

326

For a generation there was minimal change. It was corporate in nature, and little tension existed between change and continuity, acceptance and resistance.

The best way to retain the core was to accept analagous Spanish institutions.

Even in stage 3, many things (in the household regime) remained the same - single-entry walled compound, separate structures inside for nuclear families.

327

As time went on, it was quite clear even to Spaniards that councils are continuation, a striking but only partial convergence between Spanish and Nahua traditions.

In stage 3, much friction came, creating litigation and tumultos mentioned above.

328

Neither was resistance the normal reaction to Christianity: what was needed, as Spanish clerks saw, was indoctrination and rarely of conversion. The Nahuas thought they could continue their old practices and beliefs along with the new.

These attitudes were provisionally tolerated. With stage 2, the continuation of preconquest practices was pushed to the margins.

Christianity was inadequate at the level of shamanism - curing, conjuring, with practices persisting among the populace in general, not so much in a spirit of resistance to Christianity as of supplementing it within a larger system.

Sometimes members of the indigenous Christian church attached themselves to the shamanistic aspect but it fell to marginal figures.

329

Eventually, Spanish clerics took note and Nahuas became aware of the disapproval.

The indigenous people had no problems operating with money. One of the first words they borrowed meant money.

The reason was that they had an analogue: their currencies involved the cacao bean and the tribute blanket.

They had professional traders and had no problems with investment.

Religion and politics were grafted onto basic institutions of the indigenous ethnic state. The economic equivalent was the market, but it never (afterwards) received a tenth of the attention and above all was a place of interaction of Spaniards and Nahuas.

330

The overall picture in central Mexico is that of an indigenous system readily accepting but also transforming anything from the outside that was closely parallel in structure and function but wanting to continue with those aspects of the system that was not compensated for.

This experience is not universal, standing at one end of a wide spectrum.

331

In all of these matters, the basic determinants are the fit of European and indigenous culture and the contact between two populations.

That said, some methods, tools and materials did help but the indigenous people saw working better as crucial. This occurs within the framework of convergence.

Acceptance and resistance is a function of degree of convergence. Among the sedentary people, resistance was the residue left after the operation of the primary convergences that made European occupation possible.

Much of this rapproachement occurred within the context of a situation where each side (332) tended to presume that the approximately equivalent phenomenon on the other side was identical to its own.
