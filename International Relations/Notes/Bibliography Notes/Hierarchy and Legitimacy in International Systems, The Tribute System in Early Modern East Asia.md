```ad-abstract
The East Asia "tribute system" from 1368-1841 compromised an enduring, stable and hiearchic system with China the gemon.

The Chinese tributary order was in fact viable and recognised system with military, cultural and economic dimensions that intersected to create a stable system.

There is a hierarchical relationship, generated by a common culture defined by a Confucian worldview, in place the context of China and the East Asian states.

Kang believes, (592) that the East Asia "tribute system" provides an interesting contrast to the Westphalian system, comprising an enduring, stable and hierarchic system .. explicit and formally unequal but informally equal: secondary states did not believe nor did they call themselves equal to China, yet they had substantial latitude in their actual behaviour.

(593) Violence was plentiful but it tended to occur between China and the semi-nomadic people on its northern and western borders, not between China and the other Sinicized states .. nomads accepted the larger rules of the game but not Chinese notions of cultural achievement.

This article has three themes:
1. All actors in East Asia accepted a set of rules about how international relations worked, creating the tribute system
2. The system was explicitly hierarchic and cultural achievement was an important component of the rank order as was military or economic power - China was the hegemon and ranking derived from cultural achievement and social recognition. It was essentially these states that comprised an inner circle based on Confucian ideas, providing a common intellectual, linguistic and normative framework in which to resolve differences.
3. Finally, these rules and norms were consequential for diplomacy, war, trade and cultural exchange - forming the basis for relations between states.

The paper is laid out as thus: the first section will clarify the ideas of hierarchy and legitimacy, the second will discuss contending explanations of the tribute system and the third describes the empirical reality. A fourth section considers a plausible rival explanation for the stability of relations based on the distribution of capabilities and lastly the fifth section focuses on the relationship between the nomads and China, arguing that endemic confrontation resulted from cultural differences.


## HIERARCHY AND LEGITIMACY

596 Hierarchy is a rank-order based on a particular attribute: an ordinal measure from highest to lowest ... for one actor to be at the top ... one must be below.

597 Hegemony is one type of hierarchy ... arising from the acceptance some state have for the leadership and greater responsibility, influence and role of another state. ... Hegemony is the legitimate influence and authority of one state over other states.

Crafting a set of norms and rules that are viewed as legitimate by secondary states is an integral task.

598 In sum, hierarchy involves a rank order of states, and anarchy and hierarchy are not incompatible: hegemony is a form of hierarchy that involves ... norms - a social order - that secondary states find legitimate, thus making it a social system today.


# TRIBUTE SYSTEM AND ITS CRITICS

(In response to critics of the Tribute system)

600 However ... that the tribute system was either functional or symbolic ... are problematic in that they ask us to dismiss and ignore quite a bit of what officials, scholars, and governments actually did and said at the time. Both criticisms literally posit centuries of self-delusion, leading to a disparaging view of Chinese bureaucrats.

601 Why would the tribute system receive so much energy, time, and thought if it were purely symbolic and nobody believed in it? ... there is ample evidence to show that Korean and other envoys believed in what they were doing.

Why (if this is not real) did other states use these forms against each other?

Can we apply modern concepts such as states or international systems to east Asian history? One may argue that China and Korea were states, governments that defined over territory with a monopoly over domestic violence.

These political units conducted diplomatic relations using a set of agreed upon roles and institutions.

## TRIBUTE SYSTEM AND THE CONFUCIAN SOCIETY

602 China was a status quo hegemon and the other states knew and accepted it.

The tribute system emphasized formal hierarchy among nations while allowing considerable informal equality. This led to very little interstate war.

The core of the system was a set of institutions that regulated diplomatic contact.

602-603 It was formatted in two ways:
- Recognition by the superior state (investiture) and the sending of embassy envoys to the superior state.

Investiture involved explicit acceptance of tributary status, a diplomatic protocol by which a state recognized the legitimate sovereignty of another political unit.

China exercised little authority over other states.
604 States were largely free to run their domestic affairs as they saw fit.

### The Confucian Society

Korean and Japanese elites copied their institutions to craft stable relations with China, not to challenge them.

They composed a society where values, goals, and standing were mutually shared and recognised.

The core principles involved kingdoms that "shared certain government, ritual, education, literary, intellectual and social practices" with other members of the same category.

605 Confucianism is thus a set of ideas based on ancient Chinese philosophical texts about the ways by which government and society were to be organised.

Rankings by virtue dominated trade - Korea was seen as a "model" tributary and was near the top of the hierarchy, affording it different diplomatic, trade, and access privileges with China.

All four of the most Sinicized countries used the same word for history, the original meaning of which implies royal secretaries who "wrote and preserved the government ordinances".

606 Korea was ... bureaucratic ... based on Chinese and Confucian ideas - language, writing, calendar and so on.

Another feature was the absence of internecine religious wars between different types and sects of Confucianism.

### Legitimacy of the System

608 Korea sought to emulate Chinese practices but there is little evidence that the aim was to build up capabilities to match and rein in Chinese power, neither was there Chinese pressure on Korea to change its domestic practices.

Korean emulation was voluntary and had little effect of ramifying the Chinese-dominated order ... they saw it as legitmate and appropriate.

The best evidence would come from Korea's adoption of the examination system as a means for selecting scholar-officials as government bureaucrats. This key institution was borrowed directly from China and represented Confucian ideals: a government run by talent, civil servants through competition and so on.

609 Further evidence is the discussion in historical records about Confucianism, civilisation and state and societal roles. There was little evidence to show that such a discussion was merely a fa√ßade designed to fool Chinese diplomats - for example, the acceptance of Confucian ideas in the wake of the Qing conquest of China.

610 It caused extensive debate on whether the dynasty was legitimate and whether it was Confucian.

Significantly, the Japanese accepted notions of Confucian civilisation. Kelley reports that he found "no evidence of mockery or belittling of the tributary relationship" in texts.

Further evidence is the fact that Korea, Japan, Vietnam and other states used the institutions of the tribute system and replicated these rank-orders in their own relationship with other political units.

### Credible Commitments Not to Exploit

611 A key aspect of the system was the superior state's recognition of the legitimacy and sovereignty of the inferior state.

The borders between Korea and China were relatively fixed and did not significantly change during the five centuries under review - clear boundaries between states provide evidence of this status quo.

612 By the 11th century, Korea established the Yalu River as its northern border - it precluded a war.

Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century, pirate incursions and Ming China might have prompted full militarization of the new Choson dynasty.

In reality, what happened was that the founding of the Korean Choson dynasty heralded an intensification of Confucian practices, and scholar-officials became involved in policymaking at all levels, called the "Neo-Confucian revolution" when scholars imposed their ideas about proper government over objections of the military class - they came from the educated elite, not willing to rebel against an established order, driven by a desire to intensify Neo-Confucian practices, not to overturn them.

613 Relations between China and Korea were close and stable for 250 years with the two sides exchanging numerous envoys and regularly trading.

Resolution of disputed territory was done through ... institutions of the tribute system to both negotiate a resolution and establish diplomatic relations.

The tributary system did provide for effective communication, and Chinese and Korean officialdom spoke from a common Confucian vocabulary. Here, the relationship was equal.

## PLAUSIBLE RIVAL EXPLANATIONS

People argue that this is all symbolic: that China was unable to conquer Korea or Japan and Korea and Japan deferred because they saw little chance to defeat China militarily.

China actually did have the material and logistical capabilities to conquer Korea.

There is little evidence China was merely deterred by effective Korean military preparations.

616 Prominent is the lack of empirical evidence that either China or Korea considered war against each other a likely possibility. We should see strategists talking about war with each other ... but we don't.

Most difficult to explain is the Japanese general Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea in 1592 - a smaller state invading a close ally of the dominant power in the system.

It took 3 months of Korean diplomacy to convince Ming China that Korea was not conniving with Japan against China - that a balancing act would've occurred to Korea is doubtful since China was the only pole in the East Asian state system.

## CIVILIZATION AND THE OTHER: NOMADS

617 There were many different types of states that resisted China's civil allure - for example the mobile tribes of the Mongols, Khitans and Uighurs.

The nomads were less favoured due to the ecology of the steppes, which favoured mobility and made domination difficult.

What centralization did exist was due to personal charisma and strength of the ruler, making tribal rivalries and fragmentation common.

618 The nomads had vastly different worldviews: they rejected Confucian ideas of civilisation and played a different game, experiencing difficulty in crafting enduring or stable relations.

At it's core, the Chinese-nomad relationship was about trade: they needed grains, metals and textiles and would trade, raid or engage in tributes to gain them. For its part, China used offence, defence, trade and diplomacy in dealing with nomads.

619 When nomads felt they were getting too little and Chinese felt like they were giving too much, war broke out.

Endemic frontier skirmishes stemmed not only for material reasons but also reasons of identity and deeply held cultural beliefs - Nomads were willing to trade but they had no intention of taking o n Chinese norms and cultures, creating a massive chasm between the two.

## THE PAST AND THE FUTURE

China historically was an enduring, acknowledged and stable hegemon in the past, enjoying legitimacy.

There is a question in how it may live and act in a Westphalian world.

Can China adjust itself to Western norms? Will it challenge the US as a global hegemon?

It has not provoked the same fear and balance-of-power politics as it would do three decades ago.
