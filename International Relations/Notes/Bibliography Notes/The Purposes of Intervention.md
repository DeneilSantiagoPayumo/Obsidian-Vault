## Book Introduction

>[!summary]
>Violence or the potential for violence is a fact of human existence. Many societies, including our own, reward martial success or skill at arms. The ways in which members of a particular society use force reveal a great deal about the nature of authority within the group and about its members' priorities. In The Purpose of Intervention, Martha Finnemore uses one type of force, military intervention, as a window onto the shifting character of international society. She examines the changes, over the past 400 years, about why countries intervene militarily, as well as in the ways they have intervened. It is not the fact of intervention that has altered, she says, but rather the reasons for and meaning behind intervention--the conventional understanding of the purposes for which states can and should use force. Finnemore looks at three types of intervention: collecting debts, addressing humanitarian crises, and acting against states perceived as threats to international peace. In all three, she finds that what is now considered "obvious" was vigorously contested or even rejected by people in earlier periods for well-articulated and logical reasons. A broad historical perspective allows her to explicate long-term trends: the steady erosion of force's normative value in international politics, the growing influence of equality norms in many aspects of global political life, and the increasing importance of law in intervention practices.

## The Purpose of Force

This chapter begins with a brief discussion of intervention - what it is and why it is interesting theoretically. The second section presents the agenda for this book's empirical investigation. The author finds three major trends running through all three cases and argue that these constitute basic features of the dynamic normative structure.


## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Intervention, Sovereignty and War

Intervention establishes boundary conditions for two central institutions of international life - sovereignty and war. The necessary condition for sovereignty among states is non-intervention.

How do we distinguish concepts of intervention and foreign policy or war? We may think of interventions as smaller in scale, but the objective of such interventions are to replace whole governments.

In reality, there is no such definition of intervention - it is hard to define modern intervention with cases like debt-collection, or even in the 17th and 18th century - there is no concept of intervention there, just war.

The author wants to look at how participants describe intervention and ask what it is, how people understand this practice and how its contours changed.

The cases analysed here, drawn from a vast array of cases, suggest generalisations about the way we use force and how we think about it. Thus, we need to rethink the relationship between utility and legitimacy.

A lot of PolSci arguments are in this form: states do what they do using force because it fulfils some function, and they are opposed to normative arguments.

The utility of force is a function of its legitimacy. "Force is usually a means to some other end of social life, and attempts to use force alone for social control or social influence tend to not fair well over the long term. Force must be coupled with legitimacy for maximum effect." (16-17)

This has two dimensions: "The goal being pursued by force must be seen as legitimate, and force must be viewed as a legitimate means to that goal." (17)

In cases of 'better for who' and 'effective for what' new types of intervention has become useful and effective because state's definition of utility has changed. "We now understand participatory decision making in multilateral forums not only to be more legitimate but also to be more effective precisely because it is more legitimate. Similarly, multilateral intervention is widely believed to be more successful, because it bears the combined weight of so many diverse states on the target, both politically and materially - or so the thinking goes." (17)

Several themes have emerged that form the guidelines of this normative landscape:
- Some people have more influence than others over the evolution of international rules, like decision makers in strong states with the capacity for extensive military intervention
- The steady erosion of force's normative value in international politics - war has became something that was glorious, to something only legitimate as a last resort, only for defensive or humanitarian reasons. As war becomes less of a normative good, it becomes increasingly circumscribed by legal and multilateral frameworks.
- The steadily increasing influence of equality norms in global political life - norms about human equality and human rights are growing in power. Not only human equality, but sovereign equality, empowering middle powers in these operations. (See OSCE: organization for security and cooperation in Europe).
- The cases discussed here suggest that interstate uses of force are shaped by Weberian rational-legal authority structures around legal understanding and rules of international organizations.

Three themes - the malleability of strong state interests, normative devaluation of force over time and the growing importance of rational-legal authority in governing the use of force.

### CHAPTER TWO: (only the first section) Sovereign Default and Military Intervention

Until the early part of the twentieth century, it was accepted practice for states to use military force to collect debts owed to their nationals by other states. Why did this stop?

What changed were the understandings states collectively held of the relationship between sovereignty and contractual obligation, as well as their understandings of the limits of legitimate uses of force.

States intervening to collect debts justified their actions on legal grounds. "After 1902 Latin American states argued that sovereign equality of states was the foundational principle of international law and, indeed, of international order. States could not use force against one another except in self defence." (25)

Thus the rising influence of international law and lawyers was a systemic change that altered behaviours. [[Paul DiMaggio and Walter Powell]] argued that one important mechanism whereby norms influence organizational behaviour in patterned ways is through socialization by the professions of people inhabiting those organisations.

---

Steady erosion of force's normative value in international politics - end in itself, but now less.
Steadily increasing influence of equality norms in many aspects of global political life. Sovereign equality has influenced intervention rules - normative and legal notion that has restrained military intervention. When conflicts become legalized, then does the 'weak' gain power.
Interstate uses of force are shaped by Weberian rational-legal authority structure (debt collection negotiated as part of a legal framework than otherwise)
