[[Gender, Norms and International Politics]]

## Introduction

The political empowerment of women has been understood closely tied to so-called 'Western civilization' - few indicators seem more effective in signalling the civilizational standing of a state than the situation of women.

This article focuses on the status of women as a standard of civilization by examining the standard's emergence in the 19th-century European 'society of civilized states' - centring on the expectations about the proper relations between women and the political institutions between women and the political institutions of the state and how these distinguish the civilized from other societies.

A focus on the 19th century will compare the present, demonstrating how the political status of women is linked to civilization - that the exclusion of women from the political sphere used to be upheld as an indication of a more civilized society. Women's suffrage and increases in women in decision-making is held of Western political culture. This analysis will show that a full-scale exclusion of women from politics did not become a norm for 'civilized society' until the 19th century, as there was significant diversity across Europe.

Civilization is not a static concept, its meanings are contested - intersected with numerous sets of ideas and social practices, how civilization takes on meaning with reference to religion, law and organization. Given the pervasiveness of the idea, the omission is curious. Many of these scholars mention the importance of the position of women.

...

The standards of civilization that inform state behaviour are thoroughly gendered - given that the standard has changed from the exclusion to the inclusion of women, we should not take for given the link between women and the rank of a state. This article probes the question of what understandings came into place to make the exclusion possible and reasonable - what were civilized states understood to be so that it made sense to bar women from institutions?

The article points to the centrality of the simultaneous formation of three entities: the state, woman and civilization, and how the regulation of their relations changed between the era of absolutism to that of the 'civilized' constitutional state.

The status of women underscores how malleable the understandings of civilization really are. The understanding of what sort of political status women should have to indicate advancement may appear constant in the abstract while exhibiting remarkable transformation in the concrete interpretations that give standard meaning.

Three categories: the first two focus on the development of the political exclusion of women, the two-sex model allows to speak of women as a collective, making it possible to ban women from polity. The third section shows how the new sexual category women took on.

## Political Exclusion of Women as a Standard of Civilization 685

There was no standard behavioural expectations for all European states with regard to the political status of women prior to the 19th century - the number of absolutist states made room for both female sovereigns and female state officials whereas others forbade female succession to the throne and were restrictive about women serving as state functionaries.

Women became banned form formal channels of influence.

Full-scale bans were formalized into law starting in the late 18th century, accelerating in the second half.

In 1832, women were prohibited from voting in the House of Commons.

The political exclusion of women had not only became standard policy in Europe, a standard of civilization.

To be persuasive, suffragists often contended that allowing women to vote would be beneficial for the civilization advancement of a state.

By the 1910s, 3 states on the outskirts of civilized society had defied expected behaviour and enfranchised women. This behaviour was widely rejected as irrelevant for the old core of the 'truly civilized' world.

Suffrage was not a standard of behaviour for the old civilized world - these new and less civilized states' experiments with women's suffrage simply had 'neither applicability nor importance for fully sovereign states of old European civilization with developed political institutions and traditions,'

Another indicator - the legal shifts in states formally entering the 'society of civilized states'. Japan codified a total ban on women's political activities for the first time. This Chinese constitution excluded women from participating in electoral politics. Pre-colonial Africa saw a wide span of relations between women and politics. Under colonial rule, female political authority were eliminated in the name of 'progress.' Women were excluded from the colonial state structures which recognized the authority of male chiefs at the local level.

There is evidence that the political exclusion of women had become a standard for civilization by the mid-to-late 19th century. One development that made this possible is the shift to a two-sex model of sexual being and implications of that.

## From a One-Sex to a Two-Sex Model 688

The total exclusion of women was not preceded by any standard behaviour towards women - landed women had access to the state apparatus in many cases, and a number of states and a number of state shad queen rulers.

One-sex models were pervasive in Greek - women were generally seen as a lesser man, an inferior variant of a single anatomy. Female genitalia was seen as an inverted version of the male sex organ. Men had strength and courage, women are weak and inert.

This did not preclude women from political rule in the absolutist era - someone identified as a woman could rule in absence of a male alternative and if she exhibited appropriate male characteristics. It is telling that queens were depicted in masculine terms (Queen Lizzy 1 described as our 'Adam and sovereign lord').

These offered a range of routes for conceiving the relationship between ruler and polity - women's position in the relationship between ruler and state-society thus remained divergent even as the more unitary absolutist state developed. In 15th century France, scholars came to espouse a polity. A system of rule which centred on monarchic replication through male reproductive capacity could not accommodate direct female succession.

Eighteenth-century Sweden became profoundly influence by the French - ideas about the state as a male body politic.

In England, political axioms of the monarch's two bodies developed, distinguishing moral individual monarchs from the immortal public office and accommodating queen rule. English lawyers were formulating an idea of the state as a perpetual corporation and were unable to separate state and monarch.

It was found necessary to endow the Queen with two bodies: a *body natural* and a *body politic*. The body politic was supposed to be *contained within the natural body of the queen.*

English high-born women could inherit state office with their property. In 1711, Queen Ann decreed that unmarried women could vote for the English parliament.

The 19th century saw shifts in the state - state rule was depersonalized, no longer bestowed by the will of god. Law became understood as a deliberate construction by humans.

Between the late 17th and 19th century, the notion of what a person is altered dramatically. Women were now *different* from man. Each of the two distinct sexes became embodiments of either-or. Two-sex models of distinctive men and women competed with and in many cases predominate over the previous one-sex models.

There is a large feminist literature examining the implications of the 19th century constitutional state for the political role of the new and distinctive category women - the political sphere and man came to overlap more tightly than before, squeezing women out of the political realm.

Man was thought to embody physical strength and thus considered the only sex fit to occupy or govern the coercive apparatus of the state - of male gender. Men could also appear as people with 'reason' thus excluding women.

Peterson (1992) argued that a private-public divide that excluded women from state affairs was part of the foundation of the modern state system. 19th-century woman consolidated as being with characteristics and capacities for action that was in opposition to those of the constitutional state itself: state became one of reason and force, women became entrenched with emotion and weakness, the state of science and so on...

Women thus can become excluded from both state institutions resting on depersonalized rational-legal authority and from coercive institutions.

The spread of ideas about men and women as distinctive sexes and the particular development of the private / public sphere across Europe are crucial for understanding the exclusion of women from politics - linked with the rank of a state.

How did political institutions stripped of women connect with civilization?

## The Exit of Woman from the State in Civilized Society 692

The concept of 'civilization' became a commonplace of Enlightenment thought by the early 19th century - the development of the concept coincided with the emergence of the constitutional state and the two-sex model.

The idea of progress was linked towards civilization - the civilizing process was understood as transcending the brutal givens of natural existence. Civilization was conceptualized as the most elevated of several progressive levels of being, articulated with 'less advanced' groups of humans. The world was of three classes: the savage, the barbarous and the civilized.

The development of the concept of civilization cannot be traced to any one process - it is clear that the rise of social science and intensification of colonialism were important developments. The social science believed in purposive human behaviour and understood the civilizing process, information that helped society advance away from savagery.

Deliberated law increasingly became seen as a means to tame brute power not just domestically but also among states - the rise of professionalized and secret diplomacy provided a sense of rule-following, order that assured that outcomes were not guided by military right.

It is important to keep in mind the expectations for appropriate behaviour varied by the classification of the Other - it was reasonable for civilized states to engage in diplomatic bargaining, showing restraint and suspect. Patronizing, paternalistic behaviour was considered suitable towards the 'less civilized'

Many standards that determined if a polity was civilized:
1. Demonstrating the capacity for self rule and domestic system of state institutions
2. Ability to ensure basic rights such as the protection of life, liberty and property of foreigners
3. Adopting certain rules of war'

But the criteria was malleable.

Also, there was a category of women - an informal standard.
![[Pasted image 20231115233701.png]]

A society where women prospered developed rules and institutions that protected them from the stronger sex. The status of women became symbolic of the advancement away from the state of nature, the lawless and primitive condition that enabled rule by the strong.

It had effects on the advancement of society in real ways. [[Herbert Spencer]] contended that any increase of female influence would affect advancement of society in a marked manner.

A shared presumption among those grappling with the question of women and progress was that adaption to surrounding conditions was central for a society to move forwards. Adaptation was a product of competitive struggle for existence - competition and struggle brought about movement along the social stages either upward towards a higher level of civilization or downward toward barbarity or savagery. A society needed to be adaptive and capable of change.

The idea that women were inert drew from natural sciences - look at Darwin, 'not on a struggle for existence ... but on a struggle of individuals of one sex, generally males, for the possession of the other sex.'

Physical strength and intelligence of men improved whereas women's capacity remained dormant.

For scholars and travellers analysing women, they viewed them as a singular stagnant rather than progressive thought - women were not generative of advancement. It was evident that women benefitted most from living in a civilized society as women would, if not, succumb. They were placed most in need of civilization and needed to be protected yet they posed a challenge to civilization's creation and maintenance.

Many claimed that it was critical that women not be entrusted with deliberating law or with bureaucratic public functions as civilization and their own well-being would be jeopardized.

The 19th century saw identification of women as a crucial civilizing agent - because of their essential difference, women had a distinctive mission in the conversion of nature into culture with reference to the socialization of children. Many speaking for women objected to the devaluation of such qualities - that women would risk succumbing to selfishness if they were to enter the public sphere of the state.

To equate spheres with the elevation of women was a contradiction: a horrible idea, discussed as elevating women by protecting them from the brutality of politics, setting states in the right direction in the civilizing process. Women simply needed men to enjoy the benefits that civilization brought along.

Evidence from a European past proved the point that only savage societies provided a political role for women.

# Conclusion

By the 19th century, the constitutional states of civilized society had purged the new category woman from their political realm in the name of civilization - receiving attention from those interested in state advancement. Women however had no role to place in politics.

The notion that the empowerment of women as a western phenomenon is incorrect: they were not the first to break free. A look at the past destroys this.

The claim that tradition keeps women out of politics need to be modified - the full scale removal of women from the state is a recent phenomenon. It was not until the 19th century that advanced states abandoned female rule.

The claim that empowerment of women is attributable to Western values is questioned - the emergence of the 19th century constitutional state resting on procedural legitimacy and law as a product of reason was linked with the exclusion of women from the political sphere. Equally importantly, the exclusion of women was hailed as an advanced measure that set apart modern states from 'traditional' societies.

The equation between disempowerment of women and tradition, and political empowerment and modern and western values and practices need to be reconsidered.
