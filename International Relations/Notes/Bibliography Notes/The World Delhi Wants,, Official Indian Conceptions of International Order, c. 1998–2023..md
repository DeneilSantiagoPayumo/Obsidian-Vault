# The world Delhi wants: official Indian conceptions of international order, c. 1998-2023

## Article Introduction

```ad-quote
title: 1401
This article examines official Indian conceptions of international order as they have developed over the past quarter-century. It argues that despite a profound shake-up of India’s domestic political life, its vision of international order shows continuity rather than change, and such change as is evident is consistent with the crisis in contemporary international affairs. There is an unmistakable unease with domestic and international liberalism in contemporary India’s official discourse. 

But while this unease indexes a concerted attempt to craft a more ‘authentic’ domestic order, it does not indicate a decentring of the West as the preferred partner in shaping the emergent international order. As in the past, India seeks reform and not revision of the international order. At the same time, India’s chronic problem of inadequate power, along with its risk-averse responses to great power revisionism, are likely to undermine its order-shaping ambitions.

First development:

1. Sea change in India's domestic political system with the rise of electoral dominance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (Bjp), which under the leadership of Prime Minister Narenda Modi has been the ruling party since 2014 ... The regime led by Modi has sought to radically reconfigure the relationships among the Indian state, its key institutions and governance goals, and Indian society ...
2. Profound changes in international politics have caused a shift in the global ideational domain concerning order conceptions ... Developments such as the economic rise of the Asia-Pacific region, the global financial crisis of 2008, the mixed results of western intervention in the Muslim world...

India's role in this process acquires significance because the growing domestic disenchantment with liberalism is an important chapter in the story of liberalism's global decline.

This article shows that India's official order thinking during the last 25 years had remained essentially reformist, displaying a dual continuity. Traditional themes such as multipolarity, reformed multilateralism, respect for state sovereignty, and the recognition and addressing of the concerns of the global South have persisted.

The current regime breaks from the recent past in endorsing a measure of economic protectionism and showing a clear unease with liberalism at home and abroad.

"However, India’s response to Russia’s geopolitical revisionism in Europe suggests that its notion of the RIO is not, in contrast to that of the West, universal, but geographical—focused on Asia and the Indo-Pacific, where China has loomed large. At the same time, India’s power differential with China—which results in an unassertive posture despite provocative Chinese behaviour on India’s borders—as well as its security challenges, arising from a continued dependence on Russia for military hardware, raise questions about its effectiveness as a partner of the western democracies in shaping the new order." (1403)

The article takes as its primary sources the writings and speeches of those in the highest offices in government or those have enjoyed political power. 

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Orders: constitutional, liberal and rules-based

The concept of order enables the broadest intellectual organization of the deepest features of international affairs - international orders are built by great powers, and each is an 'organised groups of international institutions that help govern the interactions among the members'. Viewed as a geopolitical construct, international orders are built by great powers, and each is an 'organized group of international institutions that help govern the interactions among the members state."' (1404).

"To Hedley Bull, these goals include the preservation of the system and society of states; the maintenance of the external sovereignty of individual states; and peace, or the absence of war, among states as ‘the normal condition of their relationship, to be breached only in special circumstances and according to principles that are generally accepted.’"

"An important corrective to the view that the LIO is a western construct has come from recent scholarship that has emphasized its global co-constitution in which non-western states have played an equally important role, especially through contestations of its inequities that have affected the global South." (1405)

"After its independence, non-alignment emerged as the catch-all for India’s official conception of international order. In privileging the sovereignty of states, Indian non-alignment added postcolonial weight to the Westphalian constitutional order, which had formed the bedrock on which the institutions and norms of the 1945 order were elaborated. Sceptical of great power politics, non-alignment sought to mitigate the global impact of a tense bipolarity." (1406) ... "non-alignments was not incompatible with a Cold War era order that was heavily imprinted by the democracies. Menon notes that Nehru’s ideas on world order were ‘eminently compatible with Wilsonian liberal internationalism’, adding that Nehru ‘was willing to live within an improved version of the existing system of international governance, the Western dominated post-War global order, once it recognized and preserved the independence of states.’" (1406).

The preceding discussion allows us to define the two orders so as to set up the empirical discussion attempted below. The LIO is best seen as being intermeshed with the order of 1945. After the Cold War, it was helmed by the West under US leadership and it acquired an activist character.

"During its heyday—which roughly encompassed the 1990s and the 2000s—the LIO sought a progressive transformation of international affairs through the expansion and consolidation of its core features ... This is attempted through, first, a reclaiming of the 1945 order through its characterization as an outcome of global efforts of democratic and rule-preferring forces and, second, through a scaling-back on interventionism to promote liberalism and human rights, and an acknowledgement of the need for national economies to regulate capitalism. The RIO can thus be seen as a successor to the LIO, subtending an international situation in which the West remains prominent but not dominant." (1408).


### Order thinking from 1998 to 2014: qualified alignment with liberal internationalism

Official thinking at the highest levels of the Indian leadership reflected an alignment with the political and economic pillars of the LIO - liberal democracy and capitalism - alongside recognition of the importance of the individual in human affairs.

First, understanding liberalism's presence as a major vision in the accounts of Indian international thought written in the 2000s and second to put into perspective the relative swiftness with which Indian leaders liberalized India's economy and attempted a grand strategic reset.

"The end of the Cold War had compelled Delhi to think afresh about the global milieu that could maximize its opportunities and minimize its vulnerabilities." (1408) "However, successful handling of the global pressure that followed its nuclear tests of 1998 widened the country’s strategic horizon. It led to a clearer anticipation of an Asian landscape where China’s rise presented challenges and under institutionalization offered opportunities. And this, in turn, produced a shift in India’s approach and policy." (1408-1409).

Prime Minister Singh emphatically asserted the liberal character of India's democracy, positioning it as the principal source of India's contribution to the political component of the international order.

According to Singh, an open society went hand in hand with an open economy: by the latter, Singh meant a system that guaranteed freedom of enterprise and respected individual creativity while ensuring public investment in social infrastructure and the development of human capabilities. Capitalist globalization generated wealth, but the global economic order should address the inequities produced by its expansion and deepening both within and across national economies. Although apprehensions about the market economy developed within India’s strategic community after the financial crisis of 2008, Singh’s personal conviction in the institution remained unshaken. He thought the crisis was caused by the inability of the global financial system to credibly regulate financial innovation.

Singh’s aggressive pursuit of the agreement with the US on civil nuclear cooperation was aimed at changing the nuclear non-proliferation regime, which India had long held to be a discriminatory relic of the Cold War-era international order.

Finally, official Indian discourse remained vocal about the outdatedness or the 'democratic deficit' of the global multilateral order, and linked the lack of UN Security Council reforms to India's wariness of western military interventionism. (1411)

### Order thinking since 2014:

Discourse within its strategic community was marked by concerns about the crisis of the LIO and uncertainty over the future of international order. This analyses the emergence of the official critique of the LIO and the Indian articulation of the RIO since Modi took office.

### Official critique of the LIO:

Modi's keynote address in Singapore in June 2018 outlines his reading of the crisis of the contemporary order. He points out that we live on the edge of uncertainty, mutual insecurity, internal dislocation leading to external tensions, competition in the global commons, terrorism and extremism.

*The India Way*, written by Minister of External Affairs Jaishankar during his first years in office argues that contemporary international relations are in the midst of a profound change marked by a crisis of the 1945 order (LIO) - manifesting in consensus and collective security, the two conventional mechanisms of order maintenance. (1412)

"Instead, there is an emergent multipolarity. This is a world of 'frenemies' wherein nationalism causes friends to differ and global threats compel competitors to collaborate. Variables that drive power and affect calculations have become more complex. Accumulation of influence substitutes for rawer exercise of strength. Strategy is concerned with the effective deployment of resources rather than the use of force. Further, financial and cyber capabilities stand weaponized. The West's influence wanes as its capitals become 'symbols to run against.'" (1413)

Jaishankar:
- many sides, many players, many games.
- Critique - critical of the order's 'era of hubris' (end of history)
- West has an entirely insular mindset - Europe believe that its problems are merely the world's problems, but the world's problems are not Europe's problems (strained the international order through the overselling of trade).  

### For a rules-based international order.

Official Indian thinking on order is not revisionist - Jaishankar holds that the 1945 order is anachronistic and outdated but amenable to reform. A new order may take generations to crystalise.

In Western discourse, the RIO remains emergent in the Indian context too. It refers to a commitment to the core principles of the 1945 order: primacy of states, respect for their sovereignty, peaceful resolution of international disputes, respect for international law, preference for democracy, a regime of universal human rights, multilateralism and an open international economy.

The RIO should be encouraging of democracy but ideologically neutral. India's rise in world history is rather a 'civilizational power coming back to the international stage', not 'the return of history' - the reformed order should accord status and influence to India.

```ad-summary
title: 1416, why?
Finally, four explanations for preferring an RIO can be gleaned from Jaishankar’s book. First—and this betrays the belief that for all its conflict and discord, the international arena is a functional society—it pays to adhere to international law, agreements and understanding. ‘Compliance and its appearance are very valuable’, and there are real advantages to being perceived as a rule-abiding actor. The world’s accommodation of India’s nuclear aspirations is a case in point. Second, the mandate for rule-abiding behaviour is supported by India’s intellectual traditions on statecraft, as illustrated by the epic Mahabharata. Third, India’s history, which shapes its political outlook, supports the idea of a rule-limited order: moderation and nuance, fairness of outcomes, rejection of a winner-takes-all approach to contestation and of the dictum that the ends justify the means—all of these have led to ‘an ingrained respect for rules and norms’. And fourth, India’s growth model, essentially based on regulated capitalism, favours an RIO.

## Conclusion

Points:
- India's order thinking during the past quarter-century displays a dual continuity, traditional themes of multipolarity, reformed multilateralism, respect for state sovereignty, and the recognition and addressing of the concerns of the global South have persisted.
- Fundamental continuities - conceptions of the Modi regime, its two immediate predecessors as regards multipolarity, multilateralism, market economy, democracy and commitment to international law.
- These changes are consistent with international trends - economic deglobalization and the waning of liberalism as a global force.
- The notion of a re-emerging civilizational state has replaced liberal democracy as India's primary identity under the current regime. There is no Indian belief in a clash or conflict of civilizations between India and others however.
- The benign attitude towards the western civilizational may be instrumental - India seems set to continue converging with the West on order-building.
- India has not aligned itself with the perspective that Moscow's actions have violated the RIO - betrays the possibility that the country's conception of the RIO as not universal but geographical: focused on Asia and Indo-Pacific where it considers China as the principal force for revisionism.
- India’s reluctance to describe China’s transgressions and violence on its borders as a breach of the RIO is likely linked to the glaring differential between their overall capabilities. Realism demands that India be acutely alert to this differential in the bilateral equation and also more attuned to the fact that its hard power capability is limited in relation to its lofty order-shaping ambitions.
