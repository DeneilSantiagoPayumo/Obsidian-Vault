# The end of liberal international order
## Article Introduction

```ad-abstract
These are not happy times for liberal internationalists. No one can be sure how deep the crisis of liberal internationalism runs. However, in what follows, I argue that despite its troubles, liberal internationalism still has a future. The nature of the crisis is surprising. The threats to liberal internationalism were expected to come from rising non-western states seeking to undermine or overturn the postwar order. In the face of hostile, revisionist states, the United States and Europe were expected to stand shoulder to shoulder to protect the gains from 70 years of cooperation. But, in fact, liberal internationalism is more deeply threatened by developments within the West itself. The centrist and progressive coalitions that lay behind the postwar liberal order have weakened. Liberal democracy itself appears fragile and polarized, vulnerable to far right populism and backlash politics. In recent decades, the working and middle classes in advanced industrial democracies—the original constituencies and beneficiaries of an open and cooperative international order—have faced rising economic inequality and stagnation. Within the West, liberal internationalism is increasingly seen, not as a source of stability and solidarity among like-minded states, but as a global playing field for the wealthy and influential. Liberal internationalism has lost its connection to the pursuit of social and economic advancement within western countries.

Liberal institutionalism needs to be reinvented. An argument in three steps:
1. First I offer a way of thinking about liberal internationalism. It is not simply a creature of American hegemony. It is a more a more general and longstanding set of ideas, principles and political agendas.
2. Second, I trace liberal internationalism's crooked pathway into the twenty-first century, as it evolved and reinvented itself along the way. In the nineteenth century, liberal internationalism was seen in the movements towards free trade.
3. Third, I identify the sources of the contemporary crisis of liberal internationalism - these can be traced to the end of the Cold War. It is important to recall that the postwar liberal order was originally not a global order. It was built 'inside' one half of the bipolar Cold War system. It was part of a larger geopolitical project of waging a global Cold War.

"But the globalization of the liberal order put in motion two shifts that later became the sources of crisis:
1. it upended the political foundations of the liberal order. With new states entering the system, the old bargains and institutions that provided the sources of stability and governance were overrun. A wider array of states— with a more diverse set of ideologies and agendas—were now part of the order. This triggered what might be called a ‘crisis of authority’, where new bargains, roles and responsibilities were now required. These struggles over authority and governance continue today. 
2. The globalization of the liberal order also led to a loss of capacity to function as a security community. This can be called a ‘crisis of social purpose’. In its Cold War configuration, the liberal order was a sort of full-service security community, reinforcing the capacity of western liberal democracies to pursue policies of economic and social advancement and stability. As liberal internationalism became the platform for the wider global order, this sense of shared social purpose and security community eroded.

"Taking all these elements together, this account of the crisis can be understood as a crisis of success, in the sense that the troubles besetting the liberal order emerged from its post-Cold War triumph and expansion." (10)

"To do so again, the liberal international project will need to rethink its vision. It will either need to offer a ‘small and thick’ vision of liberal order, centred as it was during the Cold War on the western liberal democracies; or it will need to offer a ‘large and thin’ version of liberal internationalism, with global principles and institutions for coping with the dangers and vulnerabilities of twenty-first-century modernity—cascading problems of environmental destruction, weapons of mass destruction, global health pandemics and all the other threats to human civilization." (10-11)


## A collection of key ideas from the article

### Liberal internationalism and world order

"When the nineteenth century began, liberal democracy was a new and fragile political experiment, a political glimmering within a wider world of monarchy, autocracy, empire and traditionalism." 

Its general logic is captured in a cluster of five convictions: (11)
1. One concerns openness
2. There is a commitment to some sort of loosely rules-based set of relations.
3. There is a view that liberal international order will entail some form of security cooperation.
4. Liberal internationalism is built on the idea that international society is, as [[Woodrow Wilson]] argued 'corrigible' - reform is possible and power politics can be tamed.
5. There is an expectation that a liberal international order will move states in a progressive direction, defined in terms of liberal democracy.

"Overall, liberal internationalism can be more or less open, rules-based and progressively oriented. Liberal internationalism can be seen as breaking down or disappearing when international order is increasingly organized around mercantile blocs, spheres of influence, imperial zones and closed regions."

"Taken as a whole, liberal internationalism offers a vision of order in which sovereign states—led by liberal democracies—cooperate for mutual gain and protection within a loosely rules-based global space."

The connections between domestic liberalism and liberal internationalism are multifaceted, and they have evolved over the last two centuries. It is hard to see a distinctive or coherent liberal international agenda in the nineteenth century. At this time, such notions were primarily manifest in ideas about world politics that emerged from thinkers and activists committed to liberalism within countries - in ideas about liberalization of trade, collective security, arbitration of disputes and so forth. What emerges during this era is a sense of an international sphere of action that was opening up within the liberal democratic world, and a conviction that collective efforts could and should be made to manage this expanding international space. As Mark Mazower has argued, what was new was the notion that a realm of ‘the international’ was growing and that ‘it was in some sense governable'.

### The era of American Liberal Hegemony

Liberal Internationalism took on a new shape and character and with the rise of the Cold War, a US-led liberal hegemonic order emerged. In the age of Wilson, liberal internationalism was a relatively simply vision.

"FDR and his generation - facing the even more frightening rise of fascism and totalitarianism, followed by the horrors of total war. In the setting, FDR and his contemporaries found themselves advancing a new - more world-weary - vision of liberal international order. Paradoxically, it became more universalistic in its vision and more deeply tied to American hegemonic power. This universalism can be seen in the Charter of the United Nation and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights." (14) ... "The postwar order was to be a security community - a global space where liberal democracies joined together to build a cooperative order that enshrined basic human rights and social protection. At the same time, these universal rights and protections were advanced and legitimated in terms of the American-led Cold War struggle." (15)

American liberal hegemony (15-17):
1. It was built around open multilateral trade. The question was debated: how large a geopolitical market space would the United States need so as to remain a viable global power ... The US launched its efforts to open the world economy and build institutions and partnership. (15-16)
2. American liberal hegemony was also defined by its commitment to a 'managed' open world economy. This is what [[Ruggie]] has called 'embedded liberalism'. International agreements embodied in the Bretton Woods system were designed to give governments greater ability to regulate and manage economic openness to ensure that it was reconciled with domestic economic stability and policies in pursuit of fully employment. The New Deal itself provided an inspiration for this network.
3. The postwar liberal order was built around new and permanent international institution. To a greater extent than in Wilson's day, post-1914 liberal internationalists sought to build order around a system of multilateral governance.
4. There was a special emphasis on relations among the western liberal democracies. The core underlying principles and norms of the liberal order could be construed as 'universal'. FDR's Four Freedoms were of this sort and so too were the principles of multilateralism embedded embedded in the postwar economic institutions. But the order itself was organized around the United States and its liberal democratic allies and clients.

This liberal hegemonic order flourish over the decades of the Cold War. It provided a framework for the liberalization of trade and decades of growth across the advanced industrial world. Incomes and life opportunities steadily increased for the postwar generations of European, Japanese and Americans.

### Crises and transformations

The foundations of this postwar liberal hegemonic order are weakening - Europe and Japan have weakened. This shift is not a transition from an American to a Chinese hegemonic order, but a diffusion of power away from the West. China will not replace the United States as an illiberal hegemon, and the global South will probably not merge as geopolitical bloc that directly challenges the US-led order. (17)

"The older western democracies are experiencing rising inequality, economic stagnation, fiscal crisis, and political polarization and gridlock. Many newer and poorer democracies, meanwhile, are beset by corruption, backsliding and rising inequality. The great ‘third wave’ of democratization seems to have crested, and now to be receding." (18) 

During the Cold War, the American-led liberal order was lodged within the Western side of the bipolar world system. It was during these decades that the foundations of liberal hegemonic order were laid. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, this ‘inside’ order became the nucleus of an expanding global system: (18, paraphrased)
1. The United States became the sole superpower  - the world entered the unipolar moment. This made American power itself an issue in world politics.
2. With a sudden emergence of unipolarity, American power was less constrained - and it did not play the same system-functional role.

The crisis of liberal internationalism can be seen as a slow-motion reaction to this deep transformation in the geopolitical setting of the postwar liberal international project. It has two long-term effects: a crisis of governance and authority, and a crisis of social purpose.

1. First, with the collapse of the Soviet sphere, the American-led liberal international order became the only surviving framework for order, and a growing number and diversity of states began to be integrated into it. This created new problems for the governance of the order ... With the end of the Cold War, these foundational supports for liberal order were loosened. More, and more diverse, states entered the order - with new visions and agendas. The post-Cold War era also brought into play new and complex global issues, such as climate change, terrorism and weapon proliferation, and the growing challenges of interdependence ... As a result, the challenges to multilateral cooperation have grown. At the core of these challenges has been the problem of authority and governance. (p, 13)
2. Second, the crisis of the liberal order is a crisis of legitimacy and social purpose. During the Cold War, the American-led postwar order had a shared sense that it was a community of liberal democracies that were made physically safer and economically more secure by affiliating with each other. The first several generation of the postwar period - to be inside this order was to be in a political and economic space where their societies could prosper and be protected. This sense was captured in [[Ruggie]] 's notion of 'embedded liberalism'. Trade and economic openness were tendered more or less compatible with economic security, stable employment and advancing living standards.

The ideas of liberal order as a security community has been lost in the narratives of the postwar era, The US and its partners built an order - but they also 'formed a community': one based on common interests, shared values and mutual vulnerability.  This idea of a western security community is hinted at in the concept of 'risk society' put forward [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Ulrich Beck]]. Their argument is that the rise of modernity has generated growing awareness of and responses to 'risk' ... A risk society is, as Beck defines it, "a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by modernization itself." The Cold War intensified this sense of risk, and out of a growing sense of shared economic and security vulnerabilities, the western liberal democracies forged a security community. (p, 20).

The sense of security community was undermined:
1. Rapid expansion in the number and variety of states in the order
2. The liberal order lost its identity as a western security community
3. The result was an increasing divergence of views across the order about its members, their place in the world, their historical legacies, and grievances.

## Conclusion

Liberal internationalism has been embedded in the postwar American hegemonic order. It is an order that has been marked by economic openness and security cooperation as well as collective efforts to keep the peace, promoted the rule of law, and sustain an array of international institution organized to manage the modern problems of interdependence.

Today this American-led era of liberal internationalism looks increasingly beleaguered - to bet on the future of the global liberal order is a little bit like a second marriage... Travelling through crisis and disaster.

Two questions:
1. Can the US and other liberal democracies recapture their progressive political orientation?
2. Can the US and its old allies expand and rebuild a wider coalition of states willing to cooperate within a reformed liberal global order. 

There is no grand ideological alternative to a liberal international order - China, not, Russia, no
