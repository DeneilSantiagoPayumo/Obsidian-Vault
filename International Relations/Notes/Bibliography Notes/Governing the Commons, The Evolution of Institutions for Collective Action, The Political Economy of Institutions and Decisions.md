GPR - common pool resources

[[Governing the global commons]]
## Reflection on the commons

"The political scientist Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012) received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2009) for her work on the governance of the commons. Her work shows that Hardin’s ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ is incorrect, as local communities often govern and manage ‘common pool resources’ efficiently and sustainably, emphasizing the role of institutions such as cultural norms for coordinating collective action."

### INTRODUCTION:
Issues of how best to govern natural resources are disputed:
- Tragedy of the commons - state control natural resources
- Others, privatization.
- Neither the state or the market is useful in enabling individuals to sustain long-term use of natural resource systems.

### MODELS:

**Tragedy of the Commons** - degradation of the environment expected when individuals use a scarce resource in common. (Garrett Hardin 1968)
Sahelian famine, firewood crisis, acid rain, organization of the Mormon Church, urban crime... 

**Prisoner's dilemma game** - noncooperative game in which all players possess complete information, communication forbidden, dominant strategy is an equilibrium that is third-best result (nash equilbrium) versus pareto-optimal through cooperation

**Logic of collective action** - "unless the number of individuals is quite small, or unless there is coercion or some other special device to make individuals act in their common interest, rational, self-interested individuals will not act to achieve their common or group interest"

Premise of Olson's argument (logic): one cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good once the good is produced has little incentive to contribute to the provision of that good.

Theme - to free ride on the efforts of others, reducing collective benefit.

### PRESCRIPTIONS:

**Leviathan**: [[Thomas Hobbes]] - central governments to control natural resource systems, centralise control. 

*Error:* incomplete information on what is 'right', defections...

**Privatization**: private property rights, reduce inefficiency (divide the meadows in half, game against nature rather than terrain).

*Error:* what about water, land, marine rights, resource system will still be used in common.

Rather: many solutions to different people, 'getting the institutions right', the capacity of individuals to extricate themselves from dilemma situations varies from situation to situation.

What about...

**Self-financed contract-enforcement game** - private party takes on the role of an external enforcer, allows participants to exercise greater control ... arbitrator helps parties find methods to resolve disputes that arise within the set of working rules

Error: herders overestimate or underestimate the carrying capacity of the meadow, monitoring system breaks down, other problems

**Empirical methods** - (Alanya, Turkey) experiment with the fishery, spacing out the fishers far enough that production capabilities at each site are optimized, system for self-regulation

```ad-quote
collapse: closed
Cheating on the system will be observed by the very fishers who have rights to be in the best spots and will be willing to defend their rights using physical means if necessary. Their rights will be supported by everyone else in the system. The others will want to ensure that their own rights will not be usurped on the days when they are assigned good sites.
```

Author notes: some people have broken out, some people have not (out of the trap). What factors are internal to a group?

The difference is the factors outside the domain - whether participants have autonomy, whether external changes sweep quickly enough that participants are unable to notice, perverse incentive systems

It is not a catch-all: privatizing medical services tend to be more efficient than airlines, but it is really a metaphor, relying on metaphors can lead to substantively different results (nationalizing the ownership of forests in Third World countries, regulations, lack of force to regulate, bribes...)

## An institutional approach to the study of self-organization and self-governance in CPR situations

What is meant by CPRs?
Examine the general problem facing individuals in CPR situations.

CPR - natural or man-made resource system large enough to make it costly to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining benefits from its use.

Resource system - stock variables that are capable of producing a maximum quantity of a flow variable without harming the stock or the resource system itself (fishing grounds, groundwater basins, grazing areas)

Flow - harvest of flow units

Access to a CPR can be limited to a single individual or firm at the same time - resource system of "appropriation", withdraw such units called "appropriators." (Following Plott and Meyer (1975))

Producer - anyone who constructs, repairs, and takes actions to ensure the long-term sustenance of the resource system itself.

Resource system jointly produced by more than one person or firm - undertaken by multiple appropriators simultaneously or sequentially. Resource system is subject to joint use, but units are not jointly used (fish harvested by one boat).

Trial-and-error methods allow appropriators to gain a more accurate understanding of the physical world and what to expect from the behaviours of others ... Incentivized to find better solutions.

Collective-action problems extend over time - time horizons, discounts rates (in accordance to uncertainty). "If a CPR can be destroyed by the actions of others, no matter what local appropriators do, even those who have constrained their harvesting from a CPR for many years will begin to heavily discount future returns, as contrasted with present returns."

Norms of behaviours affect how alternatives are perceived and weighed: 

The most important impact that the type and extent of shared norms will have on the strategies available to individuals has to do with the level of opportunistic behaviour that appropriators can expect from other appropriators.

This general conception is one way of fulfilling Popper's advice to make the rationality principle "an almost empty principle" (Popper 1967). It places the primary weight of theoretical analysis on specifying rigorously and fully the models of the situations in which individuals find themselves. It accepts Popper's methodological advice to emphasize the way we describe the situations in which individuals find themselves so that we can use observable variables to reject our theories, rather than internal, in-the-mind, subjective variables, which are far more difficult to measure.

When multiple appropriators are dependent on a given CPR as a source of economic activity, they are jointly affected by almost everything they do. Each individual must take into account the choices of others when assessing personal choices.

Problem facing CPR appropriators is one of organizing: how to change the situation from one in which appropriators act independently to one in which they adopt coordinated strategies to obtain higher joint benefits or reduce their joint harm.

Theory of the firm - increase return, efficiency!
Theory of the state - the 'wise' ruler.

This is not enough for solving:

1. The problem of supplying a new set of institutions - prefer a set of rules that will give them the most advantageous outcome, symmetric principals facing a collective dilemma that would all benefit from a change in rules / symmetric principals facing a collective dilemma in which all would benefit from a change in rules / incentive to free-ride would undermine incentives to organise a solution
2. The problem of making credible commitments -  how to obtain long-term collective benefits, problem of commitment / effort at supply would be pointless unless appropriators could commit themselves to follow the rule
3. The problem of mutual monitoring - dilemmas inside dilemmas, without monitoring no credible commitment, no reason to propose new rules.

Appropriation problem - how to allocate a fixed, time-independent quantity of resource unit, assignment of spatial or temporal access to the resource, provision problems focus on the time-dependent nature of investment in the resource itself ... construction of the resource itself and its maintenance.

What about institutions in a set of working rules (monitored and enforced, that everyone knows, common knowledge)

Henever one addresses questions about institutional change, as contrasted to action within institutional constraints, it is essential to recognize the following:
1. Changes in the rules used to order action at one level occur within a currently "fixed" set of rules at a deeper level.
2. Changes in deeper-level rules usually are more difficult and more costly to accomplish, thus increasing the stability of mutual expectations among individuals interacting according to a set of rules.
