### Introduction
The ageing Emperor Qianlong wrote a poem after receiving Lord Macartney's mission in 1793, alluding to three ideas.

```ad-question
title: The three questions:
collapse: closed
First, the Qing Imperium was a Chinese world order presided over by Imperial China and its Son of Heaven, while also being open to the participation of non-Chinese people and states.

Second, one of the central institutional constructs of the *Pax Sinica* was the tribute system, which regulated and made possible such participation.

Third, that Europe and in the first instance Portugal came to participate in this *Pax Sinica* as one of the tribute-bearing states.
```

The emperor could not foretell is the symbolic significance of the value that the Macartney Mission represented and its importance in shaping the history of Imperial China's relations with Britain and with an expanding European international society.

Emperor Qianlong's rejection of the Macartney Mission is (James Hevia), symbolic of the "Qing's Court's refusal to allow British penetration of China in British terms".

(page 56)

This signalled a beginning of an end of historical patterns where the term of China's international engagement were dictated by the expanding European international society. China's international relations started with the Opium war, when the West brought international to the Chinese world. Traditional China had foreign relations, not international relations: conveniently consigned to the history of intellectual and cultural exchange - rarely featuring in any meaningful way in IR literature.

What underlines this problem is Eurocentrism in the interpretation of world history. This is true of even international theories, such as the grand historical narratives about the expansion of European society made by scholars Bull and Watson 1984 . In these narratives, European expansion into East Asia becomes meaningful only  when European society globalized the Westphalian system of sovereign states in East Asia and when the European standard of 'civilization' was imposed on China after 1842 and Japan after 1853.

It is silent about the historical relationship between Europe and East Asia before the West established its global domination, when it was the Chinese and other non-European actors that dictated terms of engagement.

For nearly three centuries after the first group of Portuguese traders waded on Imperial China, the interactions between the two were significant. 

(page 57)

Europeans sought to participate in *Pax Sinica* with determination, diligence and enthusiasm. This took place on terms of equality, but more often inferiority within the social structure of the Chinese order. The penetration of exotic Chinese goods and diffusion of images and ideas of China stand as testimony.

```ad-abstract
title: What this chapter will follow
This chapter will provide an account of the experience of three groups of Europeans - Jesuits, warriors and merchants, and embassies and diplomats and their encoutners and participation in the Chinese Imperium.

More specifically, the period between 1513 and 1793 (when the first Portuguese reached the Chinese shore and when Lord Macartney returned to London after his embassy)

Three arguments:
First, the European expansion into China in the 16th century was accompanied by mediations and negotiations between their world view with both sides coexisting, only isolated instances of violence.
Second, there is no historical evidence to suggest that the European society of states made any effort to draw Imperial China into the international order of its own construction with European states and non-state agents instead participating with local interests, institutions and agendas, reproducing the social structure of the Chinese world order.
Third, that political, cultural and commercial participation is contingent upon the Europeans accomodating, adapting to and/or accepting norms, values, rules and institutions.

(page 58)
In this light, the Macartney mission can be regarded as the last attempts by the Europeans to seek their participation in the institutional order - a contrast to the pattern of engagement and conflict between China and European International society in the post-Macartney period.

### Pioneering Jesuits

The Jesuits provided Europe with its first information about Chinese culture and society and also introduced European science learning into China. 

They succeeded through their attempts to participate in the socio-political and religious order through accommodation, adaptation and integration before beginning their Christian mission of conversion.

The genesis of the Jesuit policy can be traced back to St Francis Xavier, one of the founding members of the Jesuit order in 1549-52, convincing him of the need of the Jesuits to learn the culture.

```ad-quote

collapse: closed
"It is self-evident, what we want here are powerful intellects, practised in dialects, gifted with a popular eloquence, quick to follow error in its shifting ... to show the incoherence and mutual contradiction of false doctrine."

```

(Page 59)

Similarly, Alesandro Valigano advocated a strategy of penetrating China by "a confrontation with the intellectual aristocracy on its own level of language."

The key formulation of this approach was the assessment that Imperial China was in many ways equal and even superior to Europe both intellectually and materially. 

```ad-quote
title: D.E. Mungello (2005: 81-82) writes:
[The Jesuits] [r]ecognized that the Chinese ... could not be conerted by overawing them by European might. Rather, the Chinese needed to be approached as intellectual equals and shown through sophisticated arguments that Christianity was in harmony with some of their more fundamental beliefs.
```

Matteo Ricci is said to be China's first immigrant from Europe and was regarded as the pioneer in formulating and practising the Jesuits' accommodative approach to Imperial China. In practice, Ricci's compromise with the local culture started with him taking a Chinese name, dressing in silk robes, hiring domestic servants and even letting his beard grow. He even learned how to master Confucian classics, wrote classical Chinese, the crucial social group he thought was the key to success of converting them to Christianity.

He called himself a Xi Ru (a Confucian scholar from the West), and helped develop the Jesuits' accommodative approach in close collaboration with the Chinese literati.

His approach had several more sophisticated thrusts. He made good use of his knowledge of European science for the benefit of the Jesuits' missionary.

(page 60)

Using European cartography, he produced the first map of the world with all place names given in Chinese. He even placed China near the centre of the map - and produced translated works in Chinese on Western geography, astronomy and mathematics.

Ricci took another approach to choosing Chinese characters to be used in his translation of the Christian monotheistic God, convinced that the two Chinese characters could be retained conceptually and literally. He also came up with a new term, Lord of Heaven, to be used by missionaries and their Chinese converts "to avoid cultural overlays of Shangdi".

Taking advantage of the relative intellectual openness in the unusual social, cultural and political contexts, Ricci and other Jesuit pioneers embarked on an effort to create a Confucian-Christian synthesis. The main purpose was to engage these literati in philosophical discussions, adapting passages from Confucian classics to explain how those and Christianity were complementary to one another.

The use of Shangdi would be entangled in the so-called Chinese Rites Controversy. The central issue thereof concerns rituals that Chinese performed in honour of their ancestors, arguing that whilst these certain rites were superstitious, that they did not violate the monotheistic nature of the Christian God. This led to Pope Clement XI's Constitution of Prohibitions on the Chinese Rites in 1704.

Ricci's biggest achievement is seen as him obtaining the permission of the Imperial court of the Ming Dynasty for the establishment of the first European missionary residence ever in the capital of Beijing in 1601. 

(page 61)

Ricci never secured an audience although he was given freedom of movement. A more lasting achievement was that his accommodative approach provided a benchmark against which Jesuits would be accepted. This benchmark survived the collapse of the Ming Dynasty, and persisted when cultural conditions in China became less fertile for Christianity in the period leading to the final showdown of the Chinese Rites Controversy in the early eighteenth century (Minamiki 1985).

Emperor Kangxi issued decrees in which missionaries in China were urged to follow the practice of Ricci to obtain imperial protection (a basic attitude of respect for Chinese civilization and culture).

It must be acknowledged that the Jesuit were also tolerated because of their services - Jesuit missionaries remained dominant in the Imperial Bureau of Astronomy for 150 years after 1629 (movement of Ming to Qing dynasty) as their knowledge of mathematics and astronomy was exploited by imperial rulers to make calendars and enhance the legitimacy of their rule.

Court Jesuits (Jesuits who served in the imperial court) provided services for the Summer Palace: military engineers, court painters, court interpreters and so on.

(Page 62)

### Warriors and merchants.

The Jesuit's encounters with the Chinese Imperium in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have been preceded and were accompanied by activities engaged by two other groups of Europeans, warriors and merchants.

As Geoffrey Hudson writes, "when the Portuguese first reached China from Malacca" there was no thought except for material commerce and for an arrangement with the Ming emperor to secure this."

Unlike the Jesuits, their first-hand experience was not with the cultural and intellectual stalwarts of traditional China, but the greatest single economy in the world in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: an elaborate regional trading network in maritime Asia.

As the earliest European traders, the Portuguese had sought to participate in an elaborate existing regional trading system in maritime Asia rather than attempting to reinvent one.

(page 63)

The early attempts by the Portuguese to participate were full of drama and not free from violent military conflicts. Appearing at the mouth of Pearl Harbour unannounced, these Portuguese were "allowed to trade" but not to proceed to Canton (Wan 2001; Zhang 2005)

their attempts were doomed to fail from the beginning due to their mutual misperceptions as well as the Ming court's displeasure about the Portuguese capture of Malacca and the reckless behaviour of the Portuguese sailors and soldiers.

As Simao Peres d'Andrade writes, these Ports "refused to pay the Chinese the usual customs duties, administered justice according his whims, and began building fortifications in the teeth of opposition."

After 1522, the Portuguese were officially banned from trading with China.

Few military clashes occurred between Imperial China and maritime European powers over the next three centuries until the Anglo-Chinese Opium War in 1839 while the European powers fought each other for China's trade.

(page 64)

Europeans took part in imperial Chinese order in a different capacity, as warriors of another nature.

The first relates to the court Jesuits. In 1622, when Macao was under attack by the Dutch, Father Adam Schall provided tactical and technological assistance to its defenders.

The second case involves the return of Portuguese warriors in the twilight years of the Ming Dynasty, 100 years after their defeat in the sea battles. The difference is that this time the Portuguese soldiers defended the Ming. Between 1621 and 1647, they were in a number of expeditions at the request of the Ming court to assist the Ming in their military contest with the Manchu forces (Dong and Huang 2009).

The third case concerns the Dutch military cooperation with the Qing government. They believed that they could make profit by inserting themselves into existing systems of trade and taxes (Keene 2002: 76). They used force and high-handed approaches. The Dutch government offered Dutch military cooperation and naval assistance to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), hopefully done to secure trade concessions in carrying out its China trade.

They had participated in a battle against Zheng and his fleet, allying themselves with the Qing government, giving them permission to enter negotiations for trading privileges. 

The sustained endeavour of the VOC had an ambitious goal to secure Dutch trading privileges in China from the Qing government. It failed as European traders were confronted by heavily guarded trade regimes.

(page 66)

The Chinese also exercised their authority in forbidding the Portuguese from fortifying Macao. Only limited fortification of Macao was allowed by the Chinese would could revoke such concessions at will.

(page 67)

Drastic restrictions of freedom of movement were placed when in 1573, a wall and a gate, the *Porta do Cerco* was manned by guards and the Prots and other foreigners were forbidden to go beyond it without permission.

They acquiesced with these regulations for two reasons: even during years where such drastic restrictions were made, China trade carried out by the Ports prospered - "of peace and prosperity" (Will 1979: 213). Second, the government of Macao clearly knew that as the Portuguese enclave off the Chinese coast, Macao was at the mercy of the Chinese state.

(page 68)

As in the case of constructing Macao as a Port enclave, the Imperial Chinese state established the Canton system as an attempt to control European trade with Imperial China - an imperial decree in 1579 explicitly ordering that Canton be made the only port opened to foreign commerce. Five Regulations for Dealing with Foreigners in 1760 was expanded into New Eight Regulations for Dealing with Foreigners in 1835.


### Embassies and diplomats

European trade with China was carried out again by Geoffrey Hudson (1965: 235), "unofficially and not by treaty", subject to "harassing restrictions."

(page 69)

In contrast to the Jesuits, European diplomatic ventures into Imperial China were not as determined and persistent. Diplomatic contacts were not only limited but also tentative and intermittent. These European embassies met the well-entrenched tribute system with an intricate ceremonial complex and a time-honoured diplomatic tradition as part of Imperial China's statecraft.

The first Port embassy to open up arrive in Canton in 1517 but it wasn't till January 1520 that Tome Pires obtained permission to travel to Beijing. It failed due to reckless Port soldiers in Canton.

(page 70)

A cluster of European diplomatic overtures to Imperial China took place in the second half of the seventeenth century. None of these embassies challenged the supremacy of the Son of Heaven, kowtowed not only to the emperor but also at the Board of Rites.

These European envoys enjoyed relaxed receptions.

(page 71)

Such a European approach (circling back to VOC, in gaining negotiations in and access to Imperial China and meeting the emperor directly) in gaining trade was frustrated because of its incompatibility with Imperial China's statecraft of managing missions.

Perhaps the biggest pit-fall of these embassies is that "the court did not ordinarily make substantive decisions about foreign affairs except on the recommendation of the provincial officials involved."

Wills (1968: 248-49) noted of the muted conflict in diplomatic encounters, that "these values" of Sino-Dutch negotiations, "did not come into explicit conflict but remained implicit in assumptions about the rational means to achieve limited practical ends", that "there was no indication that Chinese acceptance of international law was a conscious goal of Dutch policy."

### Conclusion

(page 73)

To obtain this exotic land for cultural enrichment and wealth, Europeans became participants in the longstanding order principally.

Imperial China ... unilaterally dictated the terms of engagement. It is also clear that the diplomatic dimension of these "curious and exotic encounters" was the beginning of cross-cultural exchanges between two international societies - Chinese and European. Yet the Europeans did not challenge these beliefs.

This order came to an end only when the European society of states began to impose its own type of international society on East Asia.
