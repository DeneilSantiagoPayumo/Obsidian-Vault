## Article Introduction

>[!abstract]
>Why have states stopped issuing declarations of war? Declaring war was a norm of international politics for millennia, but now appears to have exited states’ behavioural repertoires. I argue that the proliferation of codified _jus in bello_, the law of war governing belligerent conduct, has created disincentives for states to issue formal declarations of war. The increasing number of codified international laws that govern belligerent conduct during warfare has made complying with the laws of war extremely costly. One way for states to limit these costs is to avoid admitting they are in a formal state of war by refraining from declaring war. I test this claim, as well as others, using an original data set. I also discuss several cases of nineteenth and twentieth century wars that illustrate the logic of this argument.

```ad-tldr
title: 558

I argue that states have all but stopped issuing formal declarations of war because the rise of the codified law of war governing belligerent conduct (*jus in bello*) have generated significant costs for states that declare war. As states take on increasing obligations to comply with *jus in bello* - also sometimes called international humanitarian law (IHL) - they find themelves in a quandry. Strict compliance with IHL eliminates specific strategies and weapons froms tate arsenals and requires massive investment in military training - investment that is not directed toward battlefield success. At the same time, there may be costs to noncompliance. States that violate *jus in bello* when they are indisputably obliged to comply may see their leaders and soldiers tried for war crimes, their elected officials punished by voters at the ballot box, and their reputation for being a solid citizen of the international community tarnished. One way to limit these costs is to avoid labeling a given conflict "war". Thus, the incentives to declare war decline in tandem with the proliferation of codified *jus in bello*.

Seven parts:
1. Why does declaring war matter?
2. Empirical premise - *declarations of war are increasingly rare tools in international politics*
3. The proliferation of codified *jus in bello* has made declaring war costly.
4. Several hypothesises try to explain this shift in behaviour
5. Key variables are discussed
6. Results from a series of regressions that test the hypothesis are presented
7. Conclusion.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The central premise

```ad-quote
title: 564
"State parties to war would prefer not to be held to their obligations to comply with *jus in bello* because achieving compliance has become increasingly costly. One way of avoiding liability is to create ambiguity as to whether they are in a state of war." 
```

Cost of compliances can be resided in two dimensions:

**BUREAUCRATIC COSTS**
The cost of training their military to observe the rules of law.
The author uses the war against Iraq for example - being ordered to provide laundry facilities, respect prisoner's dietary needs and more. All aerial targeting decisions were vetted - no targeting civilians, medical institutions, cultural property and more.

**STRATEGIC COSTS**
One strategic costs - certain categories of weapons are no longer permitted (gas, projectiles, expanding bullets, mines and more)
Another - the protection of cultural property.
Another - treatment of civilians, distinguishing between civilians and combatants.
Lives lost: by deploying soldiers in an suboptimal way, force protection becomes challenging.

**BENEFITS OF COMPLIANCE**
Domestic liability
Those fighting would prefer to have rules governing the treatment of prisoners.

The costs of noncompliance can be located in several dimensions:

**LIABILITY COSTS**
Even without being subject to the statute (Rome Statute that created the International Criminal Court) states are considered to be subject to the court's jurisdiction. This leaves belligerents concerned about issues of culpability for war crime with little options. National military codes also contain provisions for violations of this law.

**DOMESTIC POLITICAL COSTS**
[[Michael Tomz]] and [[Geoffrey Wallace]] finds that respondents were less supportive of policies that violated international law as compared with policies that were in compliance with international law.

**REPUTATIONAL COSTS**
A declaration of war followed by violations of *jus in bello* will find severe reputational costs - for example, India's behaviour after its 1971 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh's independence.

Indians were clearly noncompliant with the Geneva convention for treatment of prisoners - refusing to repatriate tens of thousands of Pakistani prisoners. India quick concession in the face of a trial at the ICJ was the outcome. The Bangladesh war had been an opportunity for Indians to take the moral high ground. That said, exposing India's noncompliance with *jus in bello* in a forum such as the ICJ would have eroded this high ground.

The rise of NGOs makes it difficult to hide instances of noncompliance.

**HYPOTHESIS**: "As states take on more obligations to comply with *jus in bello*, their likelihood of formally declaring war will decline." (572) *See Sino-Japanese War*
**HYPOTHESIS:** "Statues issuing declarations of war will be more likely to observe *jus in bello* than states not issuing declarations of war." (572) *See Rape of Nanking*

By declaring war, belligerents cross a bright line that leaves them without any legal wiggle room with respect to the applicability of the laws of war. (573)
