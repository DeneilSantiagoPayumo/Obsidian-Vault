## Article Introduction

>[!abstract]
>Why have states stopped issuing declarations of war? Declaring war was a norm of international politics for millennia, but now appears to have exited states’ behavioural repertoires. I argue that the proliferation of codified _jus in bello_, the law of war governing belligerent conduct, has created disincentives for states to issue formal declarations of war. The increasing number of codified international laws that govern belligerent conduct during warfare has made complying with the laws of war extremely costly. One way for states to limit these costs is to avoid admitting they are in a formal state of war by refraining from declaring war. I test this claim, as well as others, using an original data set. I also discuss several cases of nineteenth and twentieth century wars that illustrate the logic of this argument.

```ad-tldr
title: 558

I argue that states have all but stopped issuing formal declarations of war because the rise of the codified law of war governing belligerent conduct (*jus in bello*) have generated significant costs for states that declare war. As states take on increasing obligations to comply with *jus in bello* - also sometimes called international humanitarian law (IHL) - they find themelves in a quandry. Strict compliance with IHL eliminates specific strategies and weapons from state arsenals and requires massive investment in military training - investment that is not directed toward battlefield success. At the same time, there may be costs to noncompliance. States that violate *jus in bello* when they are indisputably obliged to comply may see their leaders and soldiers tried for war crimes, their elected officials punished by voters at the ballot box, and their reputation for being a solid citizen of the international community tarnished. One way to limit these costs is to avoid labeling a given conflict "war". Thus, the incentives to declare war decline in tandem with the proliferation of codified *jus in bello*.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The central premise

```ad-quote
title: 564
"State parties to war would prefer not to be held to their obligations to comply with *jus in bello* because achieving compliance has become increasingly costly. One way of avoiding liability is to create ambiguity as to whether they are in a state of war." 
```

Cost of compliances can be resided in two dimensions:

**BUREAUCRATIC COSTS**
The cost of training their military to observe the rules of law.
The author uses the war against Iraq for example - being ordered to provide laundry facilities, respect prisoner's dietary needs and more. All aerial targeting decisions were vetted - no targeting civilians, medical institutions, cultural property and more.

**STRATEGIC COSTS**
One strategic costs - certain categories of weapons are no longer permitted (gas, projectiles, expanding bullets, mines and more)
Another - the protection of cultural property.
Another - treatment of civilians, distinguishing between civilians and combatants.
Lives lost: by deploying soldiers in an suboptimal way, force protection becomes challenging.

**BENEFITS OF COMPLIANCE**
Domestic liability
Those fighting would prefer to have rules governing the treatment of prisoners.

The costs of noncompliance can be located in several dimensions:

**LIABILITY COSTS**
Even without being subject to the statute (Rome Statute that created the International Criminal Court) states are considered to be subject to the court's jurisdiction. This leaves belligerents concerned about issues of culpability for war crime with little options. National military codes also contain provisions for violations of this law.

**DOMESTIC POLITICAL COSTS**
[[Michael Tomz]] and [[Geoffrey Wallace]] finds that respondents were less supportive of policies that violated international law as compared with policies that were in compliance with international law.

**REPUTATIONAL COSTS**
A declaration of war followed by violations of *jus in bello* will find severe reputational costs - for example, India's behaviour after its 1971 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh's independence.

Indians were clearly noncompliant with the Geneva convention for treatment of prisoners - refusing to repatriate tens of thousands of Pakistani prisoners. India quick concession in the face of a trial at the ICJ was the outcome. The Bangladesh war had been an opportunity for Indians to take the moral high ground. That said, exposing India's noncompliance with *jus in bello* in a forum such as the ICJ would have eroded this high ground.

The rise of NGOs makes it difficult to hide instances of noncompliance.

**HYPOTHESIS**: "As states take on more obligations to comply with *jus in bello*, their likelihood of formally declaring war will decline." (572) *See Sino-Japanese War*

**HYPOTHESIS:** "Statues issuing declarations of war will be more likely to observe *jus in bello* than states not issuing declarations of war." (572) *See Rape of Nanking*

By declaring war, belligerents cross a bright line that leaves them without any legal wiggle room with respect to the applicability of the laws of war. In the rare cases where we see declarations of war in eras of high levels of codification of *jus in bello*, we should expect that the declaring state has good reason to believe that it can and will be highly compliant with international humanitarian law. (573)

One of the criticisms that can be levelled against this argument is that *jus in bello* can apply to undeclared wars. There is mbiguity under that,

"The absence of a clear definition of undeclared war or armed conflict persists today. The most recent word on the subject is contained in the Final Report on the Meaning of Armed Conflict in International Law, produced by the International Law Association in 2010. The report offers a very thin definition of armed conflict, arguing that “a situation of armed conflict depends on the satisfaction of two essential minimum criteria, namely: a) the existence of organized armed groups, and b) engaged in fighting of some intensity." (574)

"Put another way, from a purely legal perspective, the obligation to comply with jus in bello ought not hinge on whether war is declared. But smart political actors can and do take a different approach by avoiding stepping over the bright line of declaring war that would unequivocally bind them to comply. Even though they are engaged in conflicts that meet most ordinary language (and even social scientific) definitions of “war,” ordinary language and legal strategy frequently diverge. Thus, we often see very large conflicts labelled as “police actions,” “counterterrorism,” or “incidents” precisely because political actors want to avoid the legal ramifications of calling their conflicts “war." (574)


### ADDITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS

The UN and the Prohibition of War.

A common refrain among international lawyers is that the prohibition of war through treaties such as (indeed, especially) the United Nations Charter accounts for the decline in formal declaration of war.

This logic suggests that membership in any organisation or treaty that limits the circumstance under which states can go to war - moreover, among UN members in particular, initiators may be much less likely to may be much less likely to issue declarations of war as compared to targets.

575

**Hypothesis** 2 (H2). Members of the United Nations are less likely to issue formal declarations of war than are non members of the UN.

**Hypothesis** 2a (H2a). Victims of aggressive war and non-aggressors coming to the aid of victims of aggressive war (in compliance with article 51of the UN Charter) will be more likely to issue formal declarations of war than will aggressors. 

**Hypothesis** 2b (H2b). Members of the League of Nations and signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact will be less likely to issue formal declaration of war than non parties to the League Covenant and Kellogg-Briand Pact

576

This relates to the power of the executive - providing a legal route for the transfer of power.

**Hypothesis** 4 (H4). Democracies will be more likely to issue formal declarations of war than non-democracies.

"On one hand, counterinsurgents actively should prefer to avoid harming civilians in any way. On the other hand, the nature of Guerrilla warfare is such that it is sometimes virtually impossible to distinguish combatant from non-combatant. On balance, we might expect counter-insurgents to be less likely to issue declarations of war, as compared to belligerents fighting a conventional war, for two reasons. First, the counter insurgent power may not view their guerrilla opponent as legitimate by virtue of the opponent’s strategy and tactics. And second, insofar as states are indeed reluctant to engage the formalities of war because they want to create." (577)

**Hypothesis** 5 (H5). Belligerents that begin a war conducting a counterinsurgency will be less likely to declare war than belligerents not conducting a counterinsurgency, or those that face insurgents later in a war.

577

Not all nineteenth and early twentieth-century wars were declared. The laws of war developed in continental Europe and were not necessarily meant to apply to opponents perceived as illegitimate.

**Hypothesis** 6 (H6). Particularly in the period of low codification of jus in bello, states fighting a war against opponents they perceive as illegitimate will be especially unlikely to issue declarations of war against those states.

**Hypothesis** 7 (H7). Belligerents will be more likely to issue declarations of war if their opponents issue declarations of war

**Hypothesis** 8 (H8). Great powers will be more likely to declare war on other great powers than on non-great powers.

"The finding that the proliferation of codified jus in bello decreases the probability that states begin wars with formal declarations suggests a change in the balance of costs and benefits of employing the formalities of war. Declaring war was part and parcel of honourable behaviour in past eras." (591)

"Greater legalization in the realm of jus in bello creates incentives for states to try to exempt themselves from the laws of war."
