### Greed

Stalin made out like a bandit - getting artillery, tanks, naval cruiser, chemical warfare and more. But this reeked of miscalculation and pettiness.

Hitler took Stalin's Baltic annexations badly. The secret protocols of the pact delimited "spheres of influence" but did not specify the actions permitted or forbidden within the respective spheres. There was not a word in the Pact about Soviet occupation of any countries, let alone implanting clone regimes. (772)

Stalin needed to reckon with the circumstance that his own value to Hitler was declining in relative terms. German-annexed Silesia and the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia were major industrial centres ... the combined population of Greater Germany ... was not 290 million ... acquired an actual fifth column on Soviet territory: resolute anti-Soviet saboteurs in the newly annexed territories of western Ukraine, western Belorussia and the Baltic Republics (774-5)

Sir Stafford Cripps came in to negotiate with the USSR. The British government wanted the Soviet Union to not increase its largesse towards Nazi Germany and wanted to attain Soviet exports to Britain. Cripps believed that it was possible to get Britain and the USSR to join forces. Unfortunately, the USSR believed this was a ploy to get the USSR into the war, allowing Britain to escape.

Churchill aimed to stop an escalation in Soviet support of Germany but at the same time realised that a replacement international order would require a place for the Communist Soviet Union, and Church disliked this annexation of white people. He wanted to prevail in the war without empowering the Soviets to Europe in this bargain.

Stalin's view on Britain bordered on incoherence - dismissed the British as a "supposed "nation of shopkeepers"" (780).

Stalin's orders to mete out punishments for even minor infractions clashed with his directives to meet production targets at all costs. (782)

Hitler, in his secret July 1940 order to expand Germany's military, cut back on shipments behind contractual obligations. The Soviet Union conveyed that the Soviets would be cutting back from all deliveries, including oil.

Germany, confident, moved their troops to Finland. Stalin found 1.5 billion reichsmarks in aid from Germany to Finland, reducing their economic dependency on Finland.

Cripps: recognise Soviet authority in Baltic states, treat the USSR on part with the US by consulting with Moscow about a post-war order, will not enter an alliance against them, supply the USSR with goods necessary for its defence as long as Moscow is benevolently neutral towards Britain.

Stalin - silence.

Soviet Insiders continued to exhibit confidence bordering on arrogance.
Stalin's bold seizure and Sovietization of Romanian territory had ensured that these territories would never fall in Hitler's hands.

Most fundamentally, Stalin had failed to follow his own advice on taking the initiative to balance German power, and his growing mistrust in British-Soviet relations

Slow economic growth, bungling military budgets.
