## What does this passage cover?:

This passage covers Japan's reaction to the U.S policy, starting with the occupation of the French Indochina (September 22 1940 -> September 26 1940)

Japanese leaders believed there was no immediate crisis with the occupation of southern Indochina. That said, Roosevelt decoded the plan within a week. He was wary of Japan's willingness to risk war with Britain and the United States by going south.

Japanese leaders acted as though diplomacy with the United States were of secondary importance - US tone was considered condescending, attacking the nation's feeling of inadequacy as an upstart, non-white power. **Yosuke Matsuoka** (minister of foreign affairs of the empire of Japan) argued that Washington's response was provocative.

**Hajime Sugiyama** (field leader) protested that "one can not afford making an enemy out of the united states." Home minister **Hiranuma Kiichiro** who was a Japanese chauvinist also agreed with this idea - we cannot wage war with the United States. Matsuoka was forced to be amenable to negotiations.

Military leaders seemingly contradicted the latest imperial conference decision not to refrain from war with Britain and the United States - he called Tojo wimps, boneheads and argued that men in uniform should stop meddling in diplomacy. The conservative elements of the leadership pleaded with him to calm down, but Matsuoka "envisioned a Japanese attack on Singapore as a quick, targeted deterrence gesture, whereas the Indochinese occupation plan risked a bigger war in order, paradoxically, to be able to fight one." (167)

Japan's leaders continued to reveal their superficial understanding of the outside world - Sugiyama recommended that Japan should delay conversing with Washington until the takeover of southern Indochina was complete. Giving a chance for the US to embrace French Indochina may be a mistake. Washington may not take action over a 'peaceful' transition.

The leaders' thinking went hand in hand with Japan's norms - high moral ideals, the superiority of their spirit, wishing to 'liberate' Asia from Western colonialism, and wishing a peaceful resolution of the diplomatic and economic stalemate. "None of these were conflicting aims in their minds - as long as they remained abstract. They created the illusion of ideological and uniformity in Japan's leadership." (168)

On July 14th, Matsuoka drafted Japan's second response to the US. It announced that Japan did not admit to weakness in the wake of the collapse of the alliance between Japan, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union. They also did not want to abandon the Tripartite Pact. It asked the United States with urging Chiang Kai-shek to make peace with Japan and not interfere in the negotiation. He also wished to end informal discussions - Hull's oral statement. On July 15th Matsuoka sent the draft of Japan's response to Germany for approval.

Matsuoka was then dismissed later. They felt at a loss: the self-confident and efficient manner had impressed and captivated them. Some citizens suspected that his removal signalled a war with the Soviet Union.

"In just twelve months in office, Matsuoka had managed to entrench Japan in the very crisis with the United States that he claimed to know how to avoid." (170)

Thus, came in Admiral Toyoda Teijiro. The author claim he "had no diplomatic experience. He did, however, have the necessary connections in the military, including Ambassador Nomura, a navy veteran." (171) He claimed to his colleagues that going to the war in the pacific would be inadvisable.

Nomura hoped that there was a shift in Japanese policy. Washington, by July 18th, realised that there would be no change in Japan's policy - the new foreign policy was already coercing the Vichy government to hand over its southern Indochinese possessions.

Two days later, Roosevelt froze Japanese assets in the US with the Dutch East Indies, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the Philippines following. Somehow, they believed that the United States would not be angry with the occupation. Roosevelt threatened, after freezing the assets, of further sanctions and war if Japan tried to seize oil by force in the Dutch East Indies.

Washington laid a conciliatory proposal - if the Japanese government withdraw forces, the President would obtain from China, Britain, Netherlands and the US a declaration to regard Indochina as a neutralized country. "It reflected the strategic importance of French Indochina" which provided resources, and disassociated Japan from Hitler's regime - peace had to be secured.

**Joseph Grew**, Nomura's U.S counterpart in Tokyo had connections, studied at Harvard and understood the meaning of neutralizing French Indochina. To his astonishment, the foreign minister had no idea what Nomura was talking about. It may be incompetence or obstruction of information by pro-Axis elements.

Toyoda believed that public opinion had already changed. Grew tried to convey the importance but he had misjudged the foreign minister - he preferred to play it safe.

Konoe tried to act on Roosevelt's proposal - blamed Nomura for not communicating the importance and tried to accept it - but no illuminating record of such efforts existed.

On July 28, Japan occupied southern Indochina, putting Singapore within Japan's reach. Nagano wanted to avoid any further war, but suggested that there was no choice but to strike since they would lose their petroleum.
