## Immigration and 'the diplomacy of saving face'

The Paris Peace conference provided the ideal occasion for 'the second coming' of the Foreign Ministry, and for it to reclaim its lost ground. This pro-Western attitude placed pressure on the ministry to succeed on the immigration front.

However, this pro-Western attitude was mainly in the minority of the rest of the nation, which remained instinctively pan-Asian.

There was much at stake with the 'faces' that Japan needed to save: one being the bureaucratic reputation of Japan as a 'Western' great power and another as Japan's image as the leader of Asia. Immigration signalled the fact that Japan had not attained the great power status it had.

### The Foreign Ministry's agenda at Paris.

The ministry seized the opportunity to resolve the issue of Japanese immigration into the Anglo-Saxon territories at the Paris Peace Conference.

Let us examine the moment of the birth of the racial equality proposal at Paris: it's beginnings at the peace conference can be traced back to an incident between the Japanese plenipotentiaries and President Wilson on 22 January 1919 which exposed how out of touch the Japanese government had been about the League of Nations.

The Japanese government worked on the assumption there was still the choice of not creating the league. The Gara government's directive did not specify the wording of the so-called racial equality proposal - **Makino** and **Chinda** had to base their draft on the only relevant peace proposal that "the Japanese Government cannot remain isolated outside the League... make efforts to secure suitable guarantees against the disadvantages to Japan which would arise as aforesaid out of racial prejudice."

The proposal later sounded like it was to better treat Japanese immigrants in the member countries of the League. It was demonstrated that the linkage between the racial equality proposal and immigration was perceived by the Foreign ministry. Makino himself argued one of the issues in Japanese diplomacy was the anti-Japanese immigration legislation enacted.

On the 2 December 1918 meeting of the Diplomatic Advisory Council, Makino voiced concern that the American council should reassess the problem of racial discrimination - he referred it to as 'the race problem.'

The entire negotiations over the racial equality proposal can be understood from Makino and Chinda's determined perspectives - explaining why the Japanese broached the subject with the Americans who were considered to be the biggest stumbling block because of problems with Japanese immigration, and the painstaking attempts made by them to negotiate with the British dominions.

They rejected the overture made by Hughes on 31 March 919 to accept a formula to exempt immigration but Tokyo deemed it crucial to have some racial equality proposal. 

"In the end, the position of Makino and Chinda became untenable because of the increasing pressure placed on them both from the Anglo-Saxon powers and from Tokyo to make the proposal into a more universal, abstract one, thereby pushing it farther away from the original intention of resolving immigration issues." (92).

Equating racial equality with immigration was not the official line taken by the whole government - there was a problem with a lack of a clearly-defined notion as to what racial equality proposal entailed due to the great haste of the Hara government.

The fundamental problem made Japanese negotiations ineffective. There was no discussion in the Diplomatic Advisory council or anything.

It left a perception in the US and British Dominions that the Japanese proposal was genuinely about immigration.

The failure of the Japanese delegates to secure the proposal was attributed to the bureaucratic ineptitude of the Foreign ministry as the delegation was composed of Foreign Ministry Officials - they were placed under pressure to succeed on the racial equality proposal and the failure became a matter of ministerial reputation. The government and the Foreign Ministry were 'out of touch with the reality of national opinions' as the pro-Western policy was not representative of national opinion.

In summary: the draft proposal was representative of the tension to face this immigration problem. It was shown that the conviction held by Makino and Chinda was representative minority of pro-Western liberals in the government, showing a lack of consensus.

## Japan's status as a great power

The argument is as follows: Japan had insecurities regarding its status among other great powers that were all Western in origin. It derived from the cumulative result of Japan's historical experience of foreign relations with the Western powers - Japan felt it was not treated equally.

Japan sought to demand recognition of the racial equality of Japanese - challenging the status quo by arguing that great power status should include the racial equality of great power.

### The definition of 'great power.'

A definition on Martin Wight and Hedley Bull on international society: military strength, 'general interests' and being recognised as a great power.

These criteria, applied by Western great powers, were set by and for European powers. This definition was based on the concept of power and power hierarchy and assumed equality. It assumed that all shared a common heritage of Western civilisation but naturally Japan missed that.

### Japan's rise as the non-white great power

**The East-West debate in foreign policy**

However consensual Japan might have appeared to the outside world, it was riven with contradictory intellectual forces. There are two perspectives which existed in the period: there developed a tendency of pan-Asian and escape-Asia. The former (aija shugi) saw Japan's place as being in Asia and the latter (datsu-A ron) saw it being in the West.

We can see this informing Japan's reaction to China: Japan sought to align in China as their shared cultural background made China a natural ally, but Japan sought to reform China to help it become modernised and to counter the Western threat. Reform China and reform Asia tried to find a framework for cooperation but was abandoned when it was being perceived that Japan was being disadvantaged by association with backward countries like China and Korea, and was going to be confused.

Too much reliance on aija sugi versus datsu-A ron as an explanation is problematic for various reasons: it is historically inaccurate to see these as perspectives as they were 'expressions' of 'understanding' of 'reality'. Additionally, escape Asia was a "well camouflaged justification of why Japan gave up temporarily its interest in Korea having witnessed the impressive strength of Chinese forces." (99)

"Basically, these two expressions catered to the need, felt by the Meji leaders, to find justifications for Japan's newly found continential expansionist tendency" (99)

There was a shift in the thinking of those in the public who supposed pan-Asia type of policy towards China after Japanese victory in the Sino-Japanese War that reflected public dissatisfaction with the government's pro-Western approach to foreign policy.

The existence of these two competing intellectual and political currents indicate the complexity of dealing with the whole question of Japan's identity as it was projected internationally. There was no clear mandate if Japan should consider itself an Asian or Western power

### The rise of *jinshuron* in foreign policy debates

The rise of *jinshuron* (racial discourse) is important and relevant - one of the reasons for the public uproar over the fate of the racial equality proposal because it hit at a culturally sensitive nerve.

It is necessary to distinguish between *jinshuron* and *bummeiron* (discourse on civilisation).

Japan's sensitivity to race can be traced back to the Sino-Japanese War. The newly emergent imperialist Japan was perceived to be a threat to Western imperialism because Japan was incompatible to great powers. Kaiser's term - 'Yellow Peril' was racial and cultural in connotation.

In foreign policy debates, there was concern over racial confrontation - there was a recommendation that Japan should coalesce with the Eastern race to face this threat, an alarmist response to the government's pro-Western attitude. Solidarity with China was important as its impossible for Japan to fight a cultural battlefield alone.

*Bummeiron* represents an Escape Asia point of view - arguing the distinctiveness of the Japanese race not on the basis of race but of civilisation and culture. Okuma Shigenobu presented a *bummeiron* argument by arguing that 'Yellow Peril' was a result of national misunderstandings, leading to increased tension based on jealousy and rivalry.

For the Japanese (after their victory over Russia) the war was a war of the two civilisation in which Japan had demonstrated its capacity to belong to Western civilisation by becoming a 'civilised nation.'

### Western challenges to Japan's great power status

Through the Western definition, Japan easily progressed to a 'super nation'. However there are three challenges posed by the West to China:

1. The Triple Intervention of 1895
2. The 'yellow Peril' as seen in light of Japanese victory versus Russia
3. The Californian Alien Land Law of 1913.

Japan's status was tested by the West constantly.

The Sino-Japanese war of 1895 and the Triple intervention of 23 April 1895 respectively

- Reversed the balance of power that existed between Japan and China whereby Japan became the 'leader' of East Asia, implying that Western powers could not operate in the East Asian arena without taking Japan's interests into consideration. (103)
- China acknowledged the independence of Korea, which meant that Japan had control over Korea
- The acquisition of Formosa strengthened Japan's position relative to China

- Exposed Japan's isolated position internationally
- Humiliated by being robbed of a fruit of victory, to a 'loss of faith'
- Japan failed to obtain assistance from Britain and the United States because of its political isolation

This was submerged under the anger that "Japan had been the victim of 'bullying' by the West ... As the nation expressed outrage at the Western behaviour, anti-foreign sentiment reached such a heigh that it could only be quelled by a special decree from the Meiji Emperor." (104)

Two lessons:
- It needed to build up its military rapidly in order to strengthen its standing among Western great powers
- It should never again be isolated internationally from other great powers - should not operate unilaterally

"Henceforth, the government consciously tried to cooperate with the West and operate within the Western great power framework; that is, Western imperialism." (104-104)

The Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 was one positive indirect outcome - one way for Japan to counter the Russian threat was to form an alliance with another Western power, hence Britain becoming an object of Japan's policy towards cooperation.

However the Russo-Japanese War of 1905:
- Created anxiety that victory would lead to the resurgence of the 'Yellow Peril' that led the government to send public relations envoys to the US and Europe to prevent the alienation of Japan
- Did not ease the sense of international isolation - the victory had established Japan's status as great power in East Asia thereby making Japan perceived as a credible threat to Western imperial interests. A sense of insecurity was developing despite Japan developing (Escape-Asia) policies.

There was a number of reasons for Japan's uneasiness:
- Japan's position in East Asia became more complicated due to the involvement of more powers in its security arrangement
- There emerged the problem of Japan's China policy which created tension in the West as Japan's imperialistic ambitions became difficult for the West to contain

This period was marked with *jinshuron* as a feature of Japan's identity.

The Californian Alien Land Law of 1913:
One of the most serious challenges posed by the West to Japan in terms of undermining Japan's international status at the basic level of race. "It inflicted inordinate humiliation on the Japanese government because it was specifically targeted towards Japanese immigrants." (107)

The Japanese were concerned about being discriminated as 'inferior people' and were humiliated as "it was unable to convince the Americans that the Japanese were not a race inferior to White Americans."

### The impact of the first world war

1. Britain's changing perception of Japan as an alliance partner.

This deteriorated for several reasons: (109, paraphrased)
- The way that Japan had grabbed the opportunity to enter the war ... delivering an ultimatum to Germany without first consulting Britain even though this was done in response to Britain's request for Japanese protection of British vessels in the Pacific.
- Japan's alleged reluctance to assist the European war effort. Japan's limited conception of war aims means that military assistance did not extend beyond East Asia. British requests for military assistance on the Western front, Mediterranean and Baltic sea in September and November 1914 were refused.

British Foreign Office did not have friendly sentiments towards Japan. The British also sensed that the Japanese were losing confidence in Britain's ability to persevere to victory.

2. Conflicting policies towards China (111, paraphrased)

American perception of Japan was negatively influenced by the conflicting policies each country adopted towards China. China had always been Japan's principal preoccupation in foreign policy but the US wanted to act as China's moral tutor by encouraging its democratic nationalist movement and shielding it from other great powers.

Americans were critical of Japan's interventionist policy. (112, paraphrased)
The notification of the Twenty-One demands on 18 January 1914, including the notorious group five of demands which was designed to bring China halfway under Japan's control by stipulating the appointment of influential Japanese as political, financial and military advisers to the Chinese government. It was very imperialistic.

The Americans and the British responded very negatively - their distrust exemplified.

3. The problem of Siberian Troop Deployment

In January 1918, the British government asked the Japanese government to send troops to Vladivostok to protect armaments.

The British government had to show restraint despite its inclination to support Japanese intervention as it did not want to earn the ire of the US.

The basic positions of the Americans was to oppose the French and British requests for Japanese troops on the basis that Japanese forces might permanently occupy Siberia. They were opposed as Russians might misunderstand Allied intentions in sending troops and push them towards Germany, and also because this deployment might arouse opposition in the US due to anti-Japanese sentiment.

The first sentiment was not convincing - military expediency overshadowed political sensibilities. Really, they were more concerned over American domestic opinion (114, paraphrased).

This divided the Terauchi cabinet into two caps: Foreign Minister Motono, Army Minister Tanaka and Privy Councillor Ito Miyoji who supported the intervention and the majority who opposed it, Yamagata, Prime Minister Terauchi, leader of the opposition Hara Kei and Ambassador Uchida in Russia. Hara was concerned over attacking the relationships with the US.

America decided to consider joint troop deployment which eased tensions - then there was a debate whether to restrict the number of troops to 7m000 or to go for a general deployment. In the end, the government decided on general deployment but with modifications - deploying 73,000 troops in three provinces of Russia.

(115) It may be added that the Siberian troop deployment demonstrated not only the extent of American distrust of Japan, the changing allegiance of Britain from Japan to the United States as a future partner in the Pacific, but also the emergence of Hara, who was convinced that Japan should not be isolated internationally more than it had already been and should pursue a more *obei kyocho* (pro-Western, internationalist) approach in foreign policy.
