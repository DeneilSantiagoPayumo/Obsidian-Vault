# Evidence for Hope, Making Human Rights Work in the 21st Century

### Introduction: Anger, Hope, and the Belief You Can Make a Difference
#### What were the key points of this chapter?

##### Do human rights work?

Pessimism about human rights progress is widespread. Everyone believes that human rights abuses are getting worse. One can look at Syria, South Sudan, Burundi and other human rights hots spots around the world.

This book will address two main types of criticism and pessimism - the legitimacy and effectiveness of human rights law, institutions and movements.

Four main types of actors with quite different positions and rationales articulate these types of critiques. (p, 8-9)
1. The first are the governments with poor human rights records that criticise human rights because they don't want to be held accountable.
2. The second are members of the general public who fear that the world is on fire and that human rights isn't doing enough to help.
3. The third includes various academics from different disciplines
4. The fourth include human rights activists who worry about the lack of progress - resenting the high-handedness of large NGOs based in the Global North and the indifference of some staff in institutions.

Each of the four critiques work but can be blurred in practice. Change is happening today. We hear about the failure of the Arab Spring in Egypt or Syria, but not its successful outcome in Tunisia, or the struggle for democracy in Gambia.

Governments are not the main character in these regions. Human rights history is a contentious history.

##### The legitimacy of human rights law, institutions and movements (10-11)

Governments and scholars attack the legitimacy of human rights law by portraying them as foreign or antinational. They are portrayed as motivated by foreign ideas.

We will argue that recent historical research and surveys show that human rights law has origins in the Global South as well as in the Global north. Countries in the Global South (Africa and Latin America) has created regional institutions to protect human rights while enforcing these rights through national court decisions. National courts in Brazil, South Africa, and India have made innovative decisions about enforcing difficult economic rights such as the right to water, food, health and shelter.

##### The effectiveness of human rights law, institutions, and movements (13-14)

We will see that while there are some human rights issues that are worsening (migrants displaced by war or economic inequality) there are areas in which the situation is improving like a decline in genocide.

If human right laws and institutions have been effective, why do people believe it is getting worse? "The short answer is that we think the world is worse off because we care more and know more about human rights than ever before. The human rights movement has succeeded in drawing attention to an increasingly wide range of rights violations around the world."

##### Ethics and human rights (14-15)

We will call on authors to be more transparent about their ethical stance. International human rights law now represents an "overlapping international political consensus" - it does not mean there is no conflict, it just means that there is considerable consensus and support.

**Chapter 1 and 2** - introduction
**Chapter 3** - addressing the legitimacy of human rights.

### Response to the Critics: How to Evaluate the Legitimacy and Effectiveness of Human Rights.
#### What were the key points of this chapter?
#####  Legitimacy and human rights (26-31)

An argument against [[Samuel Moyn]].

(28) One of the biggest challenges to the legitimacy of human rights movement and law is the argument is that human rights ideas originate in the Global North and are imposed coercively on the Global South.

- It does not understand what grassroots activists learned in the 1970 s, that the UN and Organization of American States (OAS) human rights treaties and institutions set up in response to the human rights commitments in their charters were crucial resources for later mobilization.
- Not strictly about Carter - "The important human rights policies of the Carter administration helped activate and eventually consolidate, but did not initiate, the institutional development that had been underway in the Americas for thirty years. To credit Carter with the change ignores these intellectual and institutional developments." (28)
- In reality, the US and the UK were obstacles to advancement of human rights - at times US policy has supported human rights, other times they have not. (29)
- The belief that human rights ideas come only from the Global North flattens differences and disagreements about human rights within countries.

#####  legitimacy and effectiveness as matters of comparison

```ad-quote
title: 31
"The single biggest unrecognized and unnamed source of disagreement among human rights scholars and within human rights movement is a matter of measurement: the difference between those making empirical comparisons and those making comparisons to an ideal ... A comparison to the ideal involves contrasting what has actually happened with what should happen in an ideal world, whereas empirical comparison contrasts what is actually happening to what has happened in the same country in the past or to what is happening in other countries at the same time." (31)

"The distinction between ideal and non-ideal theory relates to one that Amartya Sen makes in his book, The Idea of Justice, between the optimum approach and the maximum approach to justice. Sen’s theory is about the optimum, that is, the best alternative compared to other existing alternatives within the realm of the possible, as opposed to the maximum ideal of justice, which is what perfect justice would look like in an ideal world. " (31)

```

This book will consider **maximalist** theories of justice, while empirical comparisons are connected to the optimum approach or alternatives.

##### Empirical comparison vs comparison to the ideal for measuring effectiveness

Conceptualizes movement across a "compliance continuum" for human rights.

```ad-example
title: Data for hungry people (34)
Using comparison to the ideal (a world without hunger), we are 800 million people short of our goal—a clearly negative result. But, using the same source of data, we can make an empirical comparison from 1990 to 2015, which reveals progress. Between 1990 and 2015 we have witnessed a decline in the absolute number of hungry people in the world, as well as hungry people as a percentage of the total world population. The developing regions, home to the largest percentage of hungry people, saw a forty- two percent reduction in the prevalence of undernourished people between 1990–92 and 2012. About one in eight people remained chronically undernourished in these regions in 2012–14, but that is down from one quarter of the population in 1990–92. Some critics will attribute this decrease entirely to China, which has indeed brought down hunger substantially. But it turns out that Latin America is the most successful developing region in decreasing hunger; it witnessed a decrease in the absolute number of hungry people as well as in the prevalence of hunger from fifteen percent to five percent. Sub-Saharan Africa has been the least successful—the prevalence of undernourishment declined ten percent between 1990–92 and 2014–16, though the absolute number of undernourished people increased.35 The diverging measurements of progress in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa— percentage versus absolute numbers—should also serve as a reminder that empirical comparison is not simple, and should be done with care and precision.
```

Demonstrating that the number of hungry people is down by 42% since 1990 and then trying to explain the difference between a percentage decline and a decline in absolute numbers might make people's eyes glaze over.

##### The use of implicit vs explicit comparison to the ideal to evaluate legitimacy and effectiveness

The question is - to what? To what is the human rights tradition narrow to? To what is it minimalist to? Powerless against inequality to what? To what for a ceiling for inequality? This is in response to [[Samuel Moyn]].

Moyn never provides any detail about policies he advocates. He finds human rights policies to be minimal and powerless against an unclear ideal. How can we move forward if we only have critique?


##### Neoliberalism and human rights

"Hidden causal statements take the form of an insider hint that the author, for example, knows the "root causes" of the problem, but then doesn't reveal them." (37-38)

The debate over the complicity of human rights with neoliberalism often involves the use of implicit comparison to the ideal with hidden causal statements. The hidden causal statement is the idea that human rights policies somehow lead to neo-liberal policies.

Conceptually the human rights movement and neoliberal economics view the individual completely differently - one that individual human rights should take precedence over policy matters, and the other as a self-interested individual.

"In the area of social and economic rights, human rights advocates constantly urge governments to expand educational opportunities, health services, and social security. Neoliberalism, on the other hand, often urges the state to cut back its services." (39)

"In actuality the rise of norms, laws, and institutions for the international protection of human rights predates the use of the term neoliberalism by decades." (40)

```ad-example
title: 40, example of neoliberalism and rights
collapse: closed
When neoliberalism emerged in the late twentieth century, human rights actors in some parts of the world began fighting in opposition to neo-liberal policies, not in complicity with them. Early human rights activists in Latin America, for example, were often protesting human rights violations by authoritarian anti-communist regimes that were simultaneously implementing neo-liberal economic policies. Therefore, those who insinuate that neoliberalism somehow “caused” human rights activism or vice versa are guilty of ahistoricism as well as erroneous causal inferences.

The three historical strands that converged in the 1970s to create the modern human rights movement included anti-apartheid activists in Africa, Latin American activists against neo-liberal authoritarian regimes, and activists from the Soviet Union(USSR) and the Eastern bloc against the practices of autocratic communist regimes. Many of the activists from the former USSR initially supported the introduction of market reforms, whereas activists from Latin America and the anti-apartheid struggle were more likely to oppose market fundamentalism. Just because one group of human rights activists from communist countries advocated market reforms does not mean that one can confuse human rights and neoliberalism.
```

```ad-quote
title: 41, why did they focus on 'neoliberalism'.
collapse: closed
Many human rights activists in the 1970s and 1980s focused on civil and political rights, not because of the influence of neoliberalism as some critics have claimed, but because of the nature of repression during those decades. Throughout Latin America, governments were murdering, disappearing, and imprisoning human rights activists by the thousands. It is not surprising that the human rights groups in those countries first demanded an end to executions, disappearances, and the holding of political prisoners. Across the globe, dissidents in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe mainly lacked political rights and civil liberties, not social and economic rights, and so they made civil and political rights the center-piece of their demands.54 Finally, the global demand for the end of apartheid aimed at ending harsh legal discrimination and political exclusions. These movements demanded the civil and political rights that were their most pressing concern at the moment, while at the same time believing that economic and social rights were an essential part of the human rights agenda. They realized that gaining, or regaining, civil and political rights would not be the endpoint of their struggles.
```

One big problem with comparison to an implicit ideal and hidden argument is that authors using these techniques free themselves from the obligation of providing evidence.

"Those doing comparison to the ideal, I believe, have the obligation to tell us their method, as is the standard practice for any scholarly work ... If I am using quantitative methods, I have to explain why I am using one model instead of another."

Human rights activist often use that comparison to the ideal - "When many activists, scholars, and members of the general public think about progress, they correctly point to all the ways in which our practices fall short of the ideals embodied in human rights law. Activists use the gap between the codified rights and actual practice as a tool to mobilize for change." (48)

### The Diverse Political Origins of Human Rights

This chapter, therefore, is the continuation of my response that I want to share with that student, as well as with the many otherwise well-informed students, activists, and scholars who believe that the powerful states of the Global North proposed the idea of the International protection of human rights, wrote human rights laws, and imposed them on the weak states of the Global South against their will.

This book is about international protection of rights - the belief that if your government fails to protect your rights, you have somewhere else to turn for recourse.

#### What were the key points of this chapter?
##### Human rights: a more complex and diverse origin story / Latin American contributions to the international protection of rights and democracy

National protections naturally have a longer history than international ones and originated in Western countries (57). However, these actions fall short of an international action to standardize and protect a broad set of human rights.

"The UDHR, however, was not the first time that an inter-governmental organization had adopted a detailed enumeration of rights. That distinction belongs to the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man approved unanimously ... Eight months before the UDHR." (57). This was from Latin American diplomats.

A lot of human rights discourse completely ignores Latin American contributions - contribution from the developing world. Human rights scholars, pundits and practitioners continue to argue that the idea of human rights comes from the Global North and is imposed upon by the South.

Latin American jurors and lawyers like Calvo saw themselves as being defence for human rights.

"The doctrine of popular sovereignty, however, gave a tool to many early Latin American advocates of rights because it declared that sovereignty ultimately rested with the people." (61) ... Such popular sovereignty arguments form the basis for some of today's doctrines such as the responsibility to protect, which redefines sovereignty as creating the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens. (62)

##### The Interwar Period And Post-World War II Developments for Human Rights and Democracy

Although work by lawyer such as Calvo provided important support for international law in the region, it was not until the period between World War 1 and World War II that lawyer-diplomats first introduced and promoted the idea of internationally recognized human rights. (62)

"A Latin America jurist proposed an international legal idea, which attracted the attention of European scholars, who elaborated upon it further. By 1917 Álvarez was already participating in transnational judicial networks of experts bridging, At least, the Americas and Europe. This circulation of ideas is very different from the crude understanding of some scholars today, who claim that human rights ideas all started in the Global North and were imposed upon the Global South." (63)

"At times, protecting minorities was indistinguishable from protecting individuals protecting a minority group as a whole could often result in the protection of the group’s individual members. Yet this emphasis on collective rights created new problems as well. Although they can be seen as a stepping-stone to individual rights, such approaches were also used as a justification for the forced deportations and the genocides of minority populations, done in order to form a pure nation-state, that is, a state that contained only a single national group. This also reinforced the language of colonialism as some nationalities were seen as not yet prepared to have their own autonomous state." (63-64)

"Near the end of World War II a global consensus began to emerge that human rights and democracy would need to be an essential part of the postwar order. No individual scholar or government led this global consensus; instead, ideas that had been circulating in the Interwar period and during World War II converged." (65)

Increasing support for human rights also was extended to new leaders in India. The atrocities of WW2 called into question the doctrines of sovereignty and non-intervention as well as the flaws of absolute sovereignty.

##### Dumbarton oaks and the Great Powers

Great powers stressed human rights in their war aims but were more hesitant to endorse the international protection of human rights through international law and institutions.

The US was concerned with the implications of having international protection for human rights on segregation and Jim Crow laws in the southern states. The US and UK governments were both deeply divided about including human rights in the postwar order.

"The reluctance of the great powers to include references to human rights in the UN Charter calls into question both a realist and a critical theory explanation for the origins of human rights norms. If human rights discourse emerged primarily from the goals and needs of powerful states, as realists claim, then why did these powerful states not include human rights language in the Dumbarton Oaks draft? Only China, the weakest of the four, pressed for the inclusion of an explicit statement against racial discrimination" (67)

##### The Latin American Response

"The exclusion of human rights language from the Dumbarton Oaks draft mobilized both the NGO community and a group of less powerful states, primarily in Latin America, but also the Philippines, Lebanon, New Zealand, and Australia. These countries were disappointed because they were not consulted about the Dumbarton Oaks plans for a postwar organization, and also because the draft for the UN Charter did not incorporate a number of ideals they supported, including human rights. To voice their concerns and formulate a collective policy, Latin American countries called an extraordinary meeting at the Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City in February 1945—the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace—which ended just weeks before the opening of the San Francisco Conference to finalize the UN Charter.

##### The San Francisco Conference

"Latin American countries were not alone in grappling with how to balance human rights and sovereignty. Almost as soon as the UN was set up, debates began to emerge about the conflicts between sovereignty and human rights that were embedded in the language of the Charter. In some of the early meetings of the UN, even before the UDHR was drafted, the Indian delegate, Madame Pandit, raised the issue of human rights violations in South Africa, where a large population of men and women from India faced legal discrimination. South Africa had been a training ground for Gandhi’s activism, o it held a special place in the minds of the new Indian leadership. In a General Assembly debate on the issue of sovereignty and human rights, India carried the day with the argument that the human rights of Indians in South Africa were not a matter only under the domestic jurisdiction of South Africa. South Africa had argued that this was an issue covered by Article 2 (67) of the Charter, which said, “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.”78 Pandit persuaded the General Assembly that the human rights violations of Indians in South Africa were not solely within the jurisdiction of the South African State; rather, these human rights abuses were an issue that the UN could and should investigate. This move by India made the UN clarify, for the very first time, that violations of human rights were not protected by the doctrine of sovereignty. Nehru, writing to Einstein about this struggle, said that when India fought against policies in South Africa, it “stood on the broader plane of human rights for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.” (72-73)

##### The American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man and the UDHR

"The UN Charter called on the new international organization to play a role in promoting respect for human rights, but no intergovernmental enumeration of such rights yet existed." (74)

##### The Bogota Meeting

"Latin America’s greatest contribution to human rights was an attempt “to combine and balance the individual and the communal aspect of human rights. Latin Americans did this by incorporatIng attention to human duties as well as language on human rights; they also combined attention to civil and political and economic and Social rights.  In doing so, Latin American jurists and diplomats drew on socialist, liberal, and catholic traditions to navigate between models of liberal capitalism and socialist collectivism.” (75)

"Mexicans began to worry that the international protection of human rights could lead to more, not less, intervention. The Mexican government instructed its delegates to Bogotá to change directions. They were to support only a declaration of human rights, not a legally binding treaty, and to support national protection of human rights rather than international protection. For this reason, it would be important to change the title of the new declaration, tentatively titled “The Declaration of the International Rights and Duties of Man,” by removing “international,” thus leaving its purpose more ambiguous." (76)

....


## Conclusion
### What are therefore the main arguments of this book?

```ad-quote
title: 88
The post-World War II history of the human rights movement illustrates how the less powerful embraced the idea of the international protection of human rights in attempts to restrain the more powerful, not vice versa. These less powerful groups, however, were more likely to succeed when they had allies within powerful states. In the case of the UN Charter and the UDHR, the protagonists were Latin American states, other small states, and NGOs that took leadership roles in incorporating human rights into postwar institutions and eventually were able to persuade the United States to support them, not the other way around.
