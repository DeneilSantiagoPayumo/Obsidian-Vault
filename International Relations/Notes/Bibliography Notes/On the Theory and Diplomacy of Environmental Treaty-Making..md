## Introduction
Two ways: as a process, and as an outcome. How can the process of treaty-making affect treaty outcomes? How can treaty design change the rules of the game?

Efforts to sustain cooperation manifest in international agreements: treaties, conventions, protocols, charters and acts.

Severe constraint: having to obey it, the parties may not be able to sustain every outcome.

IEA (International environmental agreements) helps us understand the outcomes we observe.

We will view international cooperation not as a process but as an outcome.

How are treaties made? What do they do? What are the specific things that it requires?

### How are treaties made?

1. Pre-negotiation: cheap-talk, random discussion on what is 'right'. Very little impact on the game. That said, the incentive to behave strategically can be eliminated by historical baseline.
2. Negotiation: complicated affairs, reducing transaction costs (how to proceed?), treaty design, stages, protocols
3. Ratification: representative at negotiations to assign in, IEAs technically only become binding after being ratified. International negotiation, the decision from domestic parties to ratify - that is the game that proceeds. Montreal Protocol - U.S drafted legislation calling for trade restrictions to be imposed against nations not accepting their responsibility (implications on foreign government, threats, signatory to an agreement?)
4. Implementation: passing of domestic legislation, reporting data to obligations, small administrative body, monitoring will be important, payoff depends if other countries are also complying. The payoff to one country depends if another is also complying with it. Cooperation, if not, will unravel. Treaties are specific - setting up regimes for managing a resource, details of what a party is supposed to do.
5. Re-negotiation: adjusted, self-enforcing, may be triggered by unforeseen changes, or calculations, or amended to all original parties.

### The Outcome of Treaty-Making

1. Participation Restriction - not given, strip countries of their ability and desire to act (trade restriction, equilibrium - signatories had nothing to gain from submitting additional members, entry deferred, third parties could not gain - North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty, however participation in Montreal protocol is restricted to parties in Vienna Convention and is open to all countries, the ozone layer is a global public good.)
2. Entry into force and minimum participation: additional requirements before becoming legally binding, countries named before it becomes ratified - bound by obligation.
3. Treaty reservation - to opt out of certain provisions, loop hole?
4. Free-rider deterrence - some countries may act will not be parties. Some treaties demand so little of signatories that free-riding can't weaken them. However, if the threat to do free-riding is not credible, they would not negotiate an agreement requiring it to be deterred: that agreement would thus be improved, process, step-by-step to reduce free riding. Perhaps, sanctions.
5. Compliance - compliance is the norm. Non-compliance can be just as deadly, restrictions on whaling, countries only sign theories that they know they can comply with.
