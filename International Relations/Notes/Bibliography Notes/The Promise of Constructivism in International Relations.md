[[Constructivist Theory]]

In this article, Hopf will: clarify constructivism's claims, outline difference the differences between "conventional" and "critical" constructivism and suggest a research agenda that provides alternative understandings of mainstream international relations puzzles, offering a few examples of what constructivism can bring.

Such as:
- alternative understanding of the meanings of anarchy, state identity, prospect for change.

## Conventional Constructivism and Issues  in Mainstream International Relations Theory

#### Actors and Structures are Mutually Constituted

Meaningful behaviour or action is possible only within an intersubjective social context - actors develop their relations through the media of norms and practices. in the absence of norms, exercise of power, or actions, would be devoid of meaning. Constitutive norms define an identity by specifying the actions that will cause Others to recognize that identity and respond to it appropriately.

Determining the outcome (as realist theorists do) will require knowing about context - culture, norms, institutions, procedures, rules, and social practices that constitute the actor and the structure alike.

#### Anarchy as an Imagined community 174

Anarchy is structural and thus must be mutually constituted by actors employing constitutive rules and social practices - anarchy is as indeterminate as Arnold Wolfers's fire. [[Anarchy is What States Make of It, The Social construction of Power Politics|Wendt]] has offered a critique of this theory, and this move opens the idea of anarchy as having multiple meanings for different actors based on their own communities of intersubjective understanding.

Self-help is a structurally determined behaviour of an actor only to the extent that a single particular understanding of anarchy prevails - if the implications are not constant, then a continuum of anarchies is possible. Where there are consequences for not being able to rely on one's own capacity, neorealist theories of anarchy are apt.

#### Identities and Interests in World Politics

Identities are necessary in IR and domestic society to ensure a minimal level of predictability and order - durable expectations between states require intersubjective identities that are stable to ensure predictable patterns of behaviour.

Identities perform three necessary functions in a society: they tell you and others who you are, and they tell you who others are. These identities strongly imply a particular set of interests or preferences with respect to choices of action.

The identity of a state implies its preferences and consequent actions - a state understands others according to the identity it attributes to them, while reproducing its own identity through daily social practice. The intersubjective structure is the final arbiter of meaning.

Neorealism assumes that all units in global politics have only one meaningful identity, that of self-interested states. Constructivism stresses that this proposition exempts from theorization the  fundamentals of political life - that of actors. State meanings depend on historical, cultural, political, and social context.

By making interests a central variable, constructivism explores how interests come to be and how interest do not - they theorize about the meaning of absent interests.

The consequence oof this work as follows: states have a far wider array of potential choices of actions than is assumed by neorealism and these choices will be constrained by social structures that are mutually created by states and structures via social practices. They have agency, but that agency is constrained by the webs of understanding of the practices, identities, and interests of other actors that prevail in particular historical context.

#### The Power of Practice 177

Neorealism and neoliberal institutionalism assume that material power is the most important source of influence in global politics whereas Constructivism argues that material and discursive power are necessary for a complete understanding.

This is linked to [[Michel Foucault]]'s articulation of the power/knowledge nexus, [[Gramsci]]'s understanding of ideological hegemony and [[Max Weber]]'s differentiation of coercion from authority are all precursors to Constructivism. We concentrate on the discursive side.

The power of social practice lies in their capacity to reproduce the intersubjective meanings that constitute social structures and actors alike - for example, the U.S military intervention in Vietnam was consistent with a number of U.S. identities - great power, imperialist, enemy, ally and so on. A most important power of practice is its ability to produce predictability: social practices reduce uncertainty among actors within a socially structured community, increasing confidence that what action one will take will be followed by others.

Actors but recognize the legitimacy of an action. The power of practice additionally is its ability to produce intersubjective meaning within a social structure.

State actions in the foreign policy realm are constrained and empowered by prevailing social practices at home and abroad - foreign policy choice is a kind of social practice that empowers the states, secures the boundaries that differentiate the economic and political spheres of practice and the appropriate domains in which actors may secure recognition. Foreign policy practice depends on the existence of intersubjective precedents and shared symbolic materials.

#### Change in World Politics 180

Constructivism is agnostic - it does not offer any more hope for change in world politics than neorealism. They review that there are many understandings of anarchy in the world, but this is an observation of an already-existing reality, still rooted in social structures, maintained by the power of practice and impervious to change. Constructivism namely offers an account of how and where change may occur.

One aspect of constructivist power is the power to reproduce, discipline and police - change in world politics is very hard when such power is realized. Constructivism conceives of the politics of identity as a continual contest for control over the power necessary to produce meaning in a social group - so long as there is difference, there is potential to change.

Constructivism appreciates the power of structure as it assumes that actors reproduce daily their own constraints through ordinary practice.

Constructivism assumes that actors and structures mutually constitute each other; anarchy must be interpreted to have meaning, state identities are part of the process of identity construction, power is both material and discursive; and change in world politics is both possible and difficult.

#### Constructivism: Conventional and Critical 181

Conventional constructivism - a collection of principles distilled from critical social theory but without the latter's more consistent theoretical or epistemological follow-through.

Conventional and critical constructivism share the same fundamentals - they deem to 'denaturalize' the social world and discover the institutions that people take as natural are actually the product of human agency. Both believe that intersubjective reality and meanings are critical data for understanding the social world. Both insists that data must be contextualized. Both accept the nexus between power and knowledge. Both accept the restoration of agency to human individuals. Both stress the reflexivity of the self and society, the constitution of actor and structure.

For conventional constructivists, authors are careful to stress that they do not depart from normal science and do not use interpretivist methodology. On the other hand, critical theory is more interpretivist.

Conventional constructivism assumes that it can specify a set of conditions under which one can expect to see one identity or another. Critical theory rejects the possibility of foundationalism. They'd argue conventional theorists participate in the naturalization of what is being observed and risks hiding the patterns of domination that may be revealed if closure could only be deferred.

Conventional constructivists wish to discover identities and their associated reproductive social practices and then offer an account of how those identities imply certain actions. Critical theorists aim to surface identities and elaborate how people come to believe in a single version of truth - exploring the myths associated with identity formation whereas conventional constructivists wish to treat those identities as causes of actions.

They also realize that the actor and observer can never be separated. Critical theorists are quite reflexive.

Conventional constructivists accommodates a cognitive account for identity whereas critical constructivists see a form of alienation driving the need for identity. They use critical social theory to specify some understandings of the origin of identity.

Critical theory's approach is rooted in assumptions about power - power is exercised in every social exchange and there is always a dominant actor. They assume that all social relations are instances of hierarchy, subordination, or domination (which ironically appears similar to expectations of realists about world agendas). Whereas conventional constructivism is aimed at the production of new knowledge and insights based on novel understandings, critical theory analyses social constraints and cultural understandings from an interest in emancipation.

## A Constructivist Research Agenda

Three sections - constructivism offers competing understandings of key puzzles, suggests what new puzzles constructivism promises to raise, point out its own weaknesses.

### Mainstream Puzzles, Constructivist Solution

**BALANCE OF THREAT**: states don't ally against power but threats. Distribution of power can't explain why the United States wasn't balanced against, instead the Soviet Union. Neoliberalists would argue that the Soviet Union was believed to be an objective threat whereas a constructivist account identifies of Western Europe, the US and the USSR rooted in sociocultural milieu.

If the latter is to be taken, it tells us that the US understood itself as the anti-communist protector. Second, how the US constructed the Soviet threat needs to be understood in how others understood that - in particular, whereas the US saw the third world as an arena for battling communism, Europeans rarely understood it in those terms, instead Europeans regarded third world states as economic actors or as former colonies.


### Security Dilemmas

Security dilemmas are the product of presumed uncertainty - they are assumed to be commonplace in world politics because states cannot know the intentions of others. That said, we don't see much evidence of security dilemmas among many pairs of states - in the study of world politics, uncertainty might be best treated as a variable, not a constant - Constructivism can provide an understanding of what happens most of the time in relations between states. Nothing at all. By providing meaning, identities reduce uncertainty.


### Neoliberal Cooperation

Neoliberalism offers compelling arguments about how states can achieve cooperation among themselves. Simple iterative interaction among states may lead to cooperative outcomes - the conditions necessary for such actions involve transparency of action, capacity to monitor any noncooperative behaviour and punish the same in a predictable fashion.

International institutions provide the conditions for this cooperation - by having rules, institutions help increase thee confidence of each state that it will not be exploited.

Constructivism may investigate how states understand their interests within a particular issue area. The distribution of identities and interests of the relevant state would account for whether cooperation is possible.

Sitting down to negotiate a trade agreement among friends affects a state's willingness to lead with a cooperative move - it might see itself as a partner in pursuit of some value other than narrow strategic interest.

A constructivist might ask: is it not likely that the level of certainty is a variable associated with identity and practice?

One of the most important components of discursive power is the capacity to reproduce order and predictability in understandings and expectations - identities are a congealed expectation - the closest one can get in social life to confidently expect the same actions from another actor.

A constructivist hypothesis would be that if the identities being reproduces by the social practices constituting that institution have gone beyond the strategic game-playing self-regarding units posited by neoliberals, and have developed an understanding of each other as partners in common enterprise, then the institution will persist even if apparently underlying power have shifted.

### The Democratic peace

The observation that democratic states have not fought each other is an empirical regularity in search of a theory. Constructivism is perfectly suited to the task of revising this peace: apprehending how the social practices and norms of states construct the identities of the same - it can also provide an account of the more general account of zones of peace.

### Constructivist Puzzles

Constructivism offers an account on the politics of identity - understanding how nationalism, ethnicity, race, gender, religion, sexuality and other communities are involved in an account of global accounts. Constructivism assumes that identities are part of the constitutive practices of the state and so productive of its actions at home and abroad.

We can understand how states view each other or if they view a state as a state as a state - if they view another state as a ally, friend, enemy, co-guarantor, threat, a democracy and so on.

It understands the differences between states, and offer and understanding of a state's nature, motives, interests, probable actions and role.

Constructivism's expectation of multiple identities for actors in world politics rests on an openness to local historical context - this opens the study of world politics to different units altogether.

A third promise is to return culture and politics to international relations theory - to the extent that constructivism is ontologically agnostic.

A last promise: a heterogamous research approach, combining with different fields and disciplines - media studies, postmodern theory and so on.

## Constructivist Problems

No theory of culture can substitute a theory of politics - there is no causal theory of identity construction.

Constructivism is an approach not a theory - and if it is a theory, a theory of process. Constructivism must adopt theories of politics to make it work. Critical theory tries to do it but it lacks empirical ness.

The conventional theory is accused of under specification - does not specify the existence, the precise nature or value of its elements. Instead, it specifies how these elements are situated vis-a-vis with each other.

The more conventional constructivism moves to furnish such a causal theory, the more it loses the possibility of maintaining an ontological openness that its interpretivist methods afford: conventional constructivists can ad do specify their theoretical elements in advance in practice.

Constructivism can make theories but the main constraint is how durable they believe the social structures that they have demonstrated will resist.

One obstacle to the development of a causal model of identity is conventional constructivism's silence on the issue of intentionality. They miss the decision based on the identity. The answer may lie in trying to marry constructivist process to psychological process.

Also we need mountains of empirical data. The evidence... is a lot.

---

A conventional constructivist reading is based on implications of its assumptions - identity reduces uncertainty so the security dilemma is less important.

A conventional constructivist account of politics rejects the mainstream presumption that world politics is so homogenous that universally valid generalizations can be expected to come of theorizing about it. It denies critical theory's idea that we should look for only the most unique.

Mainstream theory views world politics as an integrated whole. Critical theory regards world politics as an array of fragments that can never add to a whole. Conventional constructivism sees the world as a complicated array of domains that will never be coherent, but a failure to account for them will be unsatisfactory.
