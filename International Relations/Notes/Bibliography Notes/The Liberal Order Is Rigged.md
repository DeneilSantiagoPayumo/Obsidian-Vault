# The Liberal Order Is Rigged: Fix It Now or Watch It Wither
## Article Introduction

Today's foreign policy challenges arise less from problem between countries than from domestic politics within them. That is one lesson of the sudden and surprising return of populism.

What is populism? The identifying mark is the belief that each country has an authentic people who are held back by the collusion of foreign forces - it comes in a range of ideological flavours. Left-wing want to 'soak the rich' and ring-wing populists want to remove constraints on wealth in the name of growth.

"Populism is therefore defined not by a particular view of economic distribution but by a faith in strong leaders and a dislike of limits on sovereignty and of powerful institutions." (36)

Essentially, institutions have become disconnected from publics ... the effects of a neoliberal economic agenda have eroded the social contract that had previously ensured crucial political support for the order.

## A collection of key ideas from the article

### The Boats That Didn't Rise 37

"The Brexit and Trump phenomena reflect a breakdown in the social contract at the core of liberal democracy: those who do well in a market-based society promise to make sure that those disadvantaged by market forces do not fall too far behind. But fall behind they have." (38)

"As political scientists such as Robert [[Putnam]] and Margaret [[Weir]]", trends have led to different sets of Americans living in separate worlds. The well-off do not live near the poor or interact with them in public institutions as much as they used to. This self-segregation has sapped a sense of solidarity from American civic life: even as communications technology has connected people as never before, different social classes have drifted further apart, becoming almost alien to one another. And since cosmopolitan elites were doing so well, many came to the conclusion - often without realising it - that solidarity just wasn't that important for a well-functioning democracy." (38)

Elites have taken advantage of the global liberal ... to capture most of the income and wealth gain in recent decades, and they have no shared much with the middle and lower classes. Wealthier, better-educated Americans have pushed for or accepted regressive tax policies, trade and investment agreements that encouraged corporate outsourcing and the underfunding of public and higher education." (38)

The bill for that broken social contract came due in 2016 on both sides of the Atlantic ... but the fact is that politicians respond to electoral incentives even when those incentives diverge considerably from their country's long-term interests.

Moreover, business leaders and stock market, which might have been expected to serve as a brake on populist fervour, have instead mostly rewarded proposal for lower taxes with no accompanying reduction in government spending.

###  Careful What You Wish For 39-42

Some of the blame for the liberal order's woes lies with its advocates.
Policymakers - path of action, but done through a biased way. Financial firms and major corporations enjoyed privileged status within the order's institutions, which paid little attention to the interest of workers. WTO emphasize openness and failed to encourage measures that would cushion globalization's effects on those disadvantaged by it, especially workers in the tradition manufacturing sectors in developed countries.

Working-class Americans didn't understand the details of global trade deals, but they saw elite Americans and people in China and other developing countries becoming rapidly wealthier while their own incomes stagnated or declined.

Less attention has been paid to two contributing factors that stemmed from the international order itself. (42)
1. The first was a loss of national solidarity brought on by the end of the Cold War. The Soviet threat generated a strong shared sense of attachment not only to Washington's allies but also to multilateral institution. The end of the Cold War generated particular political difficulties for the Republic Party, which had long been a bastion of anticommunism. With the Soviets gone, Washington elites gradually replaced Communists as the Republican's bogeymen. Trumpism is the logical extension of that development. In Europe, the end of the Cold War was consequential for a related reason. During the Cold War, leaders in Western Europe constantly sought to stave off the domestic appeal of communism and socialism ... Without the spectre of communist-style authoritarianism haunting their societies, eastern Europeans have become more susceptible to populism and other forms of illiberalism
2. The second force stirring discontent with the liberal order can be called "multilateral overreach." Interdependence requires countries to curb their autonomy so that institutions such as the UN and the World Bank can facilitate cooperation and solve mutual problems. But the natural tendency of institutions, their leaders, and the bureaucracies that carry out of their work is to expand their authority.

### System Update (42-44)

Derigging the liberal order will require attention to substance but also to perceptions. The US has made feeble attempts to sustain something like Ruggie's embedded liberalism.

To that end, Washington should be guided by three principles.
1. First, global integration must be accompanied by a set of domestic policies that will allow all economic and social classes to share the gains from globalisation that is highly visible to voters.
2. International cooperation must be balanced with national interests to prevent overreach, especially when it comes to use of military force.
3. Washington should nurture a uniquely American social identity and national narrative - othering authoritarian and illiberal.
 
Developing policies that satisfy those principles will require innovation and creativity.

"Like it or not, global populism has a clear, marketable ideology, defined by toughness, nationalism, and nativism: "America first" is a powerful slogan. To respond, proponents of an open liberal order must offer a similarly clear, coherent alternative, and it must address, rather than dismiss, the problems felt keenly by working classes. For Democrats, "the party of jobs" would be a better brand than "the party of Increasing aggregate welfare while compensating the losers from trade." (44)
