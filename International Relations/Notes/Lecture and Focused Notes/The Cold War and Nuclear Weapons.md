## Topic one

1925 - in some sense the Cold War began in Europe and the divison in Europe with the divison into Western and Eastern parts of Europe.

It didn't stay European for long - it became a global confrontation and the international system became defined as being bipolar.

It extended into a series of proxy wars into what was called the "Third World" - a politically incorrect term now. We had the first world which were us, the second world of the Soviet Union and the Third World of the residual states. Now, we call them the global south but... eh.

The Cold War was defined as an ideological confrontation and not in terms of WW3 (as we would be dead). Importantly, each of these individual conflicts are not seen in their own terms but seen as minor episodes in an overarching global struggle - we've got the coincidence of the cold-war handling at the same time as decolonization (subject of the next lecture).

These two trends are the defining trends of the second half of the twentieth century but they've got an uneven degree of attention: IR is occupied with the Cold War and decolonization perhaps had actually got very little attention from IR at the time. There was a tendency to see things that were now related to decolonization related to residual struggles of the Cold War, as in the Vietnam war - a theatre in the struggle between East and West and not colonization.

The Cold War was an opposition between two different ways of organizing ideological systems - a total confrontation. It was an arms race, it was a geographic division of Europe and a series of proxies. It was more than this as there are different ways that opponents organised societies - even every facet of international politics was subsumed in the lens of this general struggle.

From scientific advancements, to Olympic awards and more was seen in zero-sum terms. 

The Communist way of organizing societies seem very peculiar to us, but about a 1/3 of the world's population lived under a communist regime. It seemed that for large parts of its history, Communism worked pretty well.

It seemed that for many in the West that Communism was going to win the model, and for a while the model seemed that it generated fast rates of growth (whereas Capitalism fell into instability) and many people saw Communist societies as ideologically attractive and fairer.

In a weird way, the Cold War seems to be written out of the collective memory of international relations - the cold war as a metaphor is used in either Russia or China. IR as a scholarly pursuit has a habit of taking historical analogies so we can judge the plausibility and implausibility of these metaphors

## Nuclear Weapons and the Cold War

The Cold War was intrinsically linked with the idea of nuclear confrontation - the danger was that we would turn the cold war into a violent war into a nuclear weapon war.

The stakes were about as high as you could get, and this gave a special character (not only in the policy significant) but also in the ways in which the cold war was studied. In 1945, the US started off with a monopoly on nuclear weapons and the USSR broke the monopoly in 1949 and we had a series of advancements: from atomic bombs to hydrogen bombs and the means of delivering weapons evolved from dropping them onto cities, to putting them into ICBM and more.

There was the idea of 'smaller' nuclear weapons designed to be used on the battlefield.

Yadda yadda yadda ... MAD.

Declining risk of nuclear war. There's been a massive nuclear disarmament (but still enough to destroy the world!). 


## International Security Studies (ISS) and the Cold War

The field of IR is a creation of the Cold War - the US, to a lesser extent Western governments - people believed IR was a thing that was necessary to get right due to the Communist camp and the link with nuclear weapons. 

The question: how close should academics be close to the US government? Should we academics be expanding the national interest or not? There are arguments on both sides in isolation. How close is too close? Nobody really knows.

One of the puzzles of the Cold War: was superpower peace the result of bipolarity or the result of nuclear weapons? Nobody really predicted the end of the cold war. People thought that the Cold War was going to go on forever.

Why didn't it escalate? People were pessimistic in the arms race. 

Two answers: first the answer of authority preview, MAD - the balance of terror and that any war will escalate into a nuclear war and that a nuclear war will result in the destruction of everyone. It suggests that nuclear weapons change the character of international politics in the sense that it makes great power war unfightable. Great power wars happened with some regularity in the past but if nuclear weapons are a great changer than we are in a new world. 

Perhaps the second reason is due to the distribution of power and the idea of bipolarity - from the idea of the Kremlin and White House, the world was viewed as a zero-sum game and divided into two camps, all encompassing, a struggle that was played out in every single region of the world. Arguably bipolar systems are more stable than multipolar systems. If we have two powers facing off it is a more stable relationship than 5-6 powers.

More room for passing the buck - Britain and France hoped that Nazi Germany would invade the USSR and the USSR hoped that Britain and France would be invaded by Nazi Germany. "I don't want to do it - you should do it." Balancing is more complicated.

What sort of opponents were the Soviets? Some assume rational. Some assume they were determined irrational ideological opponents. Theories about MAD and more depended on the ability of leaders to control their armed forces, and their crisis before it had become nuclear.

Bay of pigs, Cuban missile crisis and more - when tensions racketed up, it bore very little in reality to the way that things actually happened.

## The Cold War as a Security Dilemma and the Balance of Power

3rd image (systemic) perspectives from realism, indifferent to types of states (2nd image) and types of people (1st image).

This is the prime example of two countries locked into an action-reaction pattern where two or more countries steadily escalate their spending on military and threaten the other countries. Promises can't be trusted, treaties are just scraps of nature and more.

Jervis scopes this and wants to find out if the Cold War was part of this - instead of the Cold War being explained out of a 3rd image of anarchy, it is a 2nd image explanation of the political and ideological makeup of the Soviet Union and also of the United States and the West as well.

Jervis says that the situation was: if you really knew the Soviet Union, you knew that they were at to get the US and vice versa. Why? Because ideological, the idea of a Communist state inevitably Capitalist powers were seen as hostile - supposedly, inevitably, Capitalist powers *had* to fall. Jervis thinks this was mirror imaged in the US.

The 3rd image would state that if you take any other two great powers and made them the subject of the cold war, it would play out in the exact same way.
