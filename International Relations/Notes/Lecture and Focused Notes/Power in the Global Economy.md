## Three Considerations of Power in the Global Economy

A long and varied interest in the relationship between wealth and power, in explaining how international politics is affected or determined by economics

1. Marxist-inspired theories of International Political Economy, Lenin to Dependency Theory

2. The problem of globalization: the borderless global economy vs. Fragmented state authority

3. Farrell & Newman: The New Interdependence Approach, globalization as rule overlap 


### Marxist-Inspired Theories of Power in the Global Economy

Marxism: politics as a product of economics, base and superstructure

Lenin: Imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism, capitalism and war

Dependency Theory: the global haves and have-nots, core and periphery

The structural nature of Marxism: Historical forces, false consciousness

The decline of Marxist theory: the fall of the Communism, the rise of 
(capitalist) China



### Globalization, States and Capital

The globalization problem: a unified global economy, fragmented state authority

Globalization from the 1980s thanks to technological advance and policy choices 

A shift of power from states to corporations and capital? Globalization as mobile capital, state dependence on capital, the structural power of capital exit

Competition between states for capital, a “race to the bottom”?

A skeptical view of globalization: the continuing power of states, the regulatory race to the top


### Milner on Globalization and Democracy

The previous view that democracy and capitalism/globalization enhance, reinforce and perhaps even require each other vs. Contemporary doubts

Globalization undermines liberal democracy by accelerating and accentuating the general effects of capitalism in promoting populism three mechanisms:

1. Rise of inequality of wealth and income, a system rigged by and for the elite

2. Rise of insecurity: accelerated creative destruction, China shock, manufacturing decline, gig economy, AI 

3. Rise of interdependence: “There is no alternative”, forced neoliberal consensus, democratic deficit

#### Problems with Milner's arguments

The fastest increases in democratization occurred during the fastest periods of globalization, exactly the opposite of what we’d expect if globalization undermined democracy.

Where’s the crisis of democracy? 50% of countries are democracies vs 25% in 1984. Populists [sic] routinely lose elections.

Inequality: greatest reduction in absolute poverty in human history since 1978

Insecurity: unemployment rates lower than anytime in last 50 years, more spending on pensions, health, social security than ever, massive payments for Covid and energy crisis, bigger state than ever before

Interdependence: if electorates cannot influence globalizing economic policy, what was Brexit? Trump? 



#### Farrell and Newman: Globalization as Rule Overlap

The New Interdependence Approach: globalization as rule overlap, not anarchy, too many rules not too few

An example of rule overlap: Cambridge email in UK, US and EU law

Political opportunity structures: a plurality of actors, many opportunities and transnational alliances

The uneven distribution of opportunity: power and transnational quiet politics, a democratic deficit?

The limits of Farrell and Newman’s argument: So 2015? What if globalization is over?


#### Conclusions

Different takes on the relationship between economics and power in international politics

Marxism: economic structure and class relations, from imperialism to post-colonial dependency

Globalization as the competition for mobile capital, corporations vs. States, racing to the bottom or top?

Globalization as the enemy of democracy, and reasons for skepticism

Globalization and the New Interdependence Approach: Rule overlap, political opportunities, power
