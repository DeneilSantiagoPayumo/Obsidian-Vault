## Lecture notes:

## Topic one: presumptions about African International Politics

To what extent are international politics different in Africa?
What about state-building? Does that work differently in Africa?
Complications - we may use the term 'polity' including states and self-governing units like villages that may not be well-captured.

To the extent Africa is studied, there is this presumption still that the reason we look at African history is to wonder... what went wrong? Seeing the story of Africa is one of the slave trade, colonization, independence around the 1960s and the successive problems of fraud, failing states and so on. There's a bias of what went wrong in Africa.

Worth noting - the same question can be asked of China. What went wrong with China, that it is the way it is today? Remember that Africa is richer than China. Now, we see a complete change in East Asian history. Now, we ask... what went right?

Let's not be so biased.

Let's examine our biases as Africa being exploited, dominated, passive.

## Topic two: Herbst: Land, People and Political Power in Pre-colonial Africa.

One big difference between Africa on one hand and Europe is that historically people have been scarce relative to land. Most of the population grew in the 21st century.

Part of this implication: people are mobile, there was low fixed investment in farming and people migrated to fertile land. This makes life very difficult to rulers as it makes it difficult to accrue political power, it is easier to rule a large number of people in a small place than vice versa.

It makes it expensive and difficult to rule. If you try to control people as a ruler, then the people may simply leave. They can vote with their feet.

Herbst says that it was very difficult to build political power.

Another implication: people's loyalties in times of familial and political were low-level, in small communities: the extended family, to the land. Again, this made it tough as the ruler as people would simply reject the community they're *not* part of. They tend to be **composite**.

Political power therein is difficult to hold on to. Things just kept falling apart...

Property rights thereof were incredibly different. In Africa there were more developed property rights than people - people owned people. Africans owned Africans.

Polities tend to be small: stateless societies and composite states.

## Topic three: The Precolonial African International System

In Africa, we didn't have sharp borders towards polities. We had fuzzy frontiers, overlapping sovereignty.

The state is optional - states aren't something we have in European societies. Tilly and Spruyt and Hobbes talked that there are no alternatives to the state - it had to happen everywhere... but it didn't have to happen. Between half to a quarter of the population in the 19th century did not live in the state. The state is optional and there are other ways of getting along,

Maybe what happened in Europe didn't need to happen?
Speaking of Tilly, obviously there's a sense of war in Europe and Africa, but war was fought for people. You don't fight for things that are not valuable like territory - you want to fight over things that are scarce like people. There were wars of enslavement and property was expressed in terms of people not land the idea was to forcibly gather the population into somewhere where you can control it.

Wars of enslavement were a super big deal, the equivalent of wars for territorial conquest in Europe.

One of the weird things about Europe is how maritime. They *love* long distance maritime trade, an occasion uncommon in the East and Africa. There are comparatively little African maritime trade and very little urbanisation. Instead, they focused on territorial policies.

European colonialisation only really happened at the end of the 19th century - otherwise, Africa was mainly ruled by Africans. European colonialisation was only a short period, but they were in contact with the 1440s.


## Four Centuries of Pre-colonial African-European Relations.

There was four hundred years of relations between Europe and Africa that is nearly ignored by international relations theorists. Instead, there's misleading stereotypes and wrong presumptions - Europe was *not* in charge for most of Africa's history.

If that's the wrong story then what is the right story?

Well, both in the military and commercial states, for these 400 and 50 odd years, especially in Atlantic Africa, both militarily and commercially, Africa was superior and Europeans were inferior.

Partly European technology wasn't decisive, guns didn't make a huge difference. Europeans were keen on selling guns to Africa. Secondly, there was a disease problem for Europeans. When Europeans went to America, America citizens died because of no immunities ... and for Africa, the opposite happened. Europeans died. This meant that the numbers of Europeans in Africa was very, very small. Europeans were either too busy dying or being sick or getting super drunk.

There were exchanges and things went two ways. Africa was also more likely to grab things from Islam.

Hold on, wasn't the slave trade the complete disconfirmation of this story? Firstly, there were three important slave trades involving Africa: one of which that get the attention, and two not-so-much. The first is the Atlantic slave trade where a couple million Africans were taken to the Americas ... requiring constant replenishment of slaves and a high death rate.

Just like there was a big trade to the west, there was an equally big trade in the East. Although the figures are less good, about 10-12 million Africans were taken across the ocean to the middle East or America. This far exceeded the Atlantic slave trade.

There was a very big internal slave trade in Africa. Why was there a slave *trade* than a forcible extraction of people from Africa? They had to pay African rulers to get African slaves. Why didn't they smash and grab and kidnap people? It certainly wasn't moral compulsions ... they just weren't powerful enough to do so. The technology and numbers wasn't decisive that they couldn't just grab it.

```ad-quote
title: The Slave Trade:
Thornton 1998: p.125: "African participation in the slave trade was voluntary and under the control of African decision makers ... Europeans possessed no means, either military or economic, to compel African leaders to sell slaves."

Northrup 2014: p.63 "African kings and merchants not only took the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade in their stride but actually increased their degrees of control and the share of the trade's financial records."
```

The number of slaves in Arica kept going up, not down. There were more slaves in Africa than there actually ever was in the Americas.

The plantations that existed in the Americas, in the 1800s, sprung up and multiplied in Africa.
There is this common conception: you don't enslave your own, you enslave anyone else. But this difference doesn't have to be racial - it could be religious: those who are *not* Muslim could be fair game by Islamic countries. There were plenty of Europeans enslaved by Islamic countries.

The biggest business is people.. whether if you were looking at trade or migration, the biggest flow were connected with slavery. What matters for migration matters for relations, ideas of progress and so on. Slavery was common in Africa, but wasn't unique to Africa. Slavery was a thing in East-Anglia as well! Slavery peaked in 1870s and 1880s, then a strange thing happened: slavery went out of fashion. By the 1920s, slavery became rare.

By the 1970s, slavery became nearly extinct but now there's no more slavery. In historical terms, we live in a better world.

What about human trafficking and modern slavery? Wrong category - kidnapping someone is illegal. Human trafficking in crime is not slavery. People in labour conditions are not slaves but are forced to work. There are other forms of exploitation. Get the categories right ... you dunce.

Are you pro-colonialism, or pro-slavery. Looking at history prompts very difficult question. This undermines normal questions.

## Conclusion:

Think about the differences and contrasts between Africa and Europe.
The abundance of land and scarcity of people - sovereignty didn't mean sharp borders.

Difficulties for things to fall apart.

War for people, not war for land.

Africans weren't subordinate victims to the 400 years with European's first encounters and the colonial experience that came late and was relatively short. It's ... complex. Rather than being an exception to this, the Atlantic slave trade reinforces this picture of African dominance and European subordination.
