title: Introduction of the paper
The core readings are vital - you must do all of it, with questions and answers for the supervision essays.
The exams are handwritten.

Really, there is no 'starting point' as humans have been living in organised groups for a very long time. However, there are some areas to start:
1. Relations between groups, China and Rome, Indian Ocean, Polynesians, the Silk Road and the Vikings
2. 1500 a a starting point for global politics: European voyages of West and East, 1492, 1498 and all that
3. The birth of a globally interconnected system: exchange of goods, ideas and disease
4. Age of discovery or European villains and Asian, African and American victims? Old and new eurocentricism?
5. First encounters: how do groups that have never been in contact before manage relations?

A question: how do you do relations between two groups that are total, and completely, alien to one another.

### Asian-European Relations: Age of Partnership or Contained Conflict?

The Portuguese Estado da India, a protection racket from East Africa to China from 1600s Dutch, English, French.

They were a protection racket heavily interested in the seas. What they found in the 1500s and 100 years later with the Dutch, English and French was these huge Asian empires - Chinese, Mughlai India and Japan. These empires were vastly more stronger, more wealthier than these European ones. These Asians were just as technologically advanced as these European states, if not more - especially with their guns.

For three centuries after they had got to Asia, the Europeans were inferior and couldn't get away with it (with the Asians).

Furthermore, the Europeans had an economic problem with trade. They found Asia and all these stuff they wanted: spice, silk, porcelain but the Asians didn't want much that they had. This is a problem: the Europeans could not grab anything from the Asians and could not sell anything aside from silver or gold. Therefore, they were at a disadvantage.

In regards to mistaken identities: in 1517, when the Ports get to China, these translators said that the port monarchs were the same level of the Chinese empire and got presumably beheaded.

Similarly, when the Ports got to India in the early 1500s they found this Hindu temples and didn't know what Hinduism was: they knew these temples weren't Jewish, Christian or Muslim so therefore Hindu temples *must* be churches. Hindus looked at the Ports and thought that they were Muslims as they believed in one god.

When you encounter something strange for the first time, you tend to try and interpret the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar. They tended to use categories that they would understand.

In terms of rituals and etiquette, the Dutch was humiliated by the locals, forced to spit and trample on ducks or learn Mandarin to make themselves useful to the Chinese ports, and gain any sort of cohort with them. Asians didn't think much of the Europeans: Europeans couldn't think of why Asians wash so much and Asians though the Euros smelt bad.

"Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders. There is therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce."

### The New World: Americans and Europeans

This is the idea: very small groups of Europeans getting across the Atlantic and doing a great job of smashing up local empires.

Whilst Europeans did a good job of smashing up the Aztecs and the Incas, but there is still a big difference between the relations of the Asians and Americans: 
First off, Europeans did really have superior military technology compared to these Asian people. In contrast, when they went to America they found no guns or weapons so locals were in danger.
Secondly, there was a few hundred Europeans but tens and thousands of local allies that even the Europeans themselves regarded the Americans themselves as a marginal fringe presence.
(Possible misreading?)
Third, there was the exchange of disease - things like smallpox, common cold or measles were incredibly dangerous to populations in America that had zero exposure to these ideas before. Up to 90 percent of the local population died because of diseases brought to the new world and thusly had no immunity to these diseases. Europeans got syphilis.
There was also animals not seen that were exchanged: horses, cattle, pigs, crops, sugar, bananas.
This was something known as the Columbia exchange.

There was a figure named [[Lockhart]] who said one of the bad habits we have is reading history backwards: Europeans (mainly the Ports) won in the end so therefore they must've won from the beginning, with the Americans losing. This is a deeply wrong idea as for a long time (at least 100 years or longer) Europeans were pretty marginal and most of the population of the America went in regards to their business as before.


Even if European monarchs said: "I'm in charge" and such, that doesn't make it so: that these aspirations were delusional boasts for decades and over a century after the point they were made.

What really governed the relationship was mutual misunderstanding: they regarded themselves as 'in charge' of the overlords, that the Americans subordinate to us belong to the Spanish. The Spanish thought that the Americans thought that too, which was completely wrong - but the locals thought they were in charge: their leaders were in charge and things carried on pretty much as they had before.

The Americans thought that the Spanish knew and understand this and that they respected it. Because each side thought each side was wrong, they got on well... aside from the Europeans using genocide and enslavement to destroy populations in the Caribbean islands.

Lockheart argues that despite the violence, there was a lot of compromise, a lot of negotiation in this 'new world.' In this way, Europeans found it easier to use violence against societies that looked like them; societies that were stationery, hierarchal, based in agriculture compared to people who don't stay in the same place who were less lucrative targets.

For the first 350 years after the Europeans reached the Americans, it was not the process of the Europeanisation of the Americans but the Africanisations of the Americans, a lot of people crossed over to the Americans were Africans as slaves in mines or plantation economy. Europeans had to have a lot of labour. Locals died, between 10 and 12 million African slaves across the pacific for the European project.

They were, demographically, the 3rd most important person.

Don't be seduced of the old Eurocentrism, or the new one as Europeans in charge and doing awful things, Europeans did not do this in Asia (as they were going to get destroyed) for at least for the first three hundred years, a story of Europeans having to adapt to Asian ways of doing things.

The Americans are a different story as the Europeans *could* do a horrible story but a story of sudden conquest and rupture is wrong: a slow and incremental story of negotiation, compromise (and a whole lot of Africanisation).

The world recognizably became one place within the 1500s to 1600s created this transplant and exchange on the basis of mutual misunderstanding and miscomprehension, trading with each other.

Lastly, people get on best when they can't understand each other: this is not always the case and that at least in these early modern encounters of people between these cultural backgrounds, misunderstandings would've been best. The real violence came when Europeans forced people to understand European ideas and these international relations were carried on the basis of local rules became reinterpreted as European ways of understanding things.

This is the subject of a different lecture.
