Theory helps to simplify a complex reality beyond stereotypes and prejudice.
There are many terms for this theory: rational institutionalism, rationalism, liberalism, neo-liberal institutionalism, neo-liberal.

Theories can't be taken in dialogue: there must be dialogue among them.

Even if we start from a pessimistic start for international relations, we can move on to happy outcomes. In an environment of anarchy where states are selfish, we can still have good things happen in international politics and liberal institutionalism helps make the magic happen.

Liberal Institutionalism tends to say that most of the stuff we're studying are about international economic relations, political economy, stuff like global trade, cross border investment.

They're a big fan of this analogy with states and firms: with Spruyt, there's this assumption that states are rational and that states are selfish, they're egotistical, rational.

For him, a rational action means a state calculates the action with the most benefits and the least costs. Separated means and ends.

It's interested in the systemic operation.

## [[Keohane]]'s *After Hegemony*, 1984

It's main analysis is that the US as a hegemony is in decline, and tackles the question how will we have cooperation? Here, the assumption is that a leader is needed.

We're going to lose our leader and states aren't altruistic. What next? There's a very plausible chance that the US has lost its interest in leading security, environmental or otherwise initiative.

There are many problems of cooperation. Even if we have a situation where all states are rational, they still won't cooperate.

In explaining why its difficult for rational individuals, Keohane starts with a simple thought experiment - the prisoners dilemma (yeah, say it with me... ugh).

### The Prisoner's Dilemma

Sharman begins talking about the prisoner's dilemma. We apply this to international relations.

The more people and actors we have involved, as long as they are rational and selfish, the tougher cooperation gets. The best choice always depends on what others do, a dominant strategy.

Let's consider the tragedy of the commons and the free-rider problem.

The UK has lower carbon emissions and do this by moving the energy sector to alternative sources of energy. There are national costs but global benefits.

Climate change is either stable globally or not. Britain's contribution is only 2 percent and will only reap 2 percent of the benefits... but has to bear all of the cost in Britain to cleaner sources of energy. But most of the benefits are gained elsewhere, making global climate stability. The British government has a choice: we want climate stability but these costs are eye-watering. Let's think it through: what are other countries going to do? If everybody shifts to renewable energy, then Britain doesn't need to transition to clean energy. But if Britain shifts to clean energy, and nobody else will, then it will futile and expensive. Therefore, whatever other countries should do, Britain should not transition.

This applies to all other governments. Because of this, we get into situations where countries fail to transition to climate change.

Despite that, the nature of repeated games changes: the more time it is repeated, the greater the benefits get. The balance in the longer term starts to tilt. The more we play, the longer the benefits of cooperation. In this term, as we look and project into the future, we begin to collaborate.

### The role of institutions

Institutions perform this knowledge function - they organize parties and information, organized by hundreds and hundreds of parties.

States ally because they find the calculation of short term betrayal, of being shut out of future international reputation.

But then why haven't we solved climate change?

Well, the value of cooperation isn't clear - the records of people's behaviour has to be clear. We have to pay back a specified amount of money in a specified time. Unfortunately, the Paris agreement are in fact written in a vague sense so it's hard to discern because the phrasing is that 'states should make ambitious efforts' ... what is an ambitious effort? How can you tell an ambitious effort from a non-ambitious effort?

Reputations don't form when you can't categorize behaviour by cooperative and non-cooperative. Why didn't they think of that?! Well, they did think of this... they didn't want to be held accountable too closely. They wanted to score. It is slightly disingenious.

## Conclusions on Liberal Institutionalism and Co-operation

Cooperation is useful but hard to get. In International Politics we don't have a leviathan or a world state. We're in a bind. Cooperation in international politics is going to be difficult.

Leaves us with an idea that we can start from these pessimistic assumptions and that all is not lost but given that we have institutions that work in a selfish state, even if those states are in it for themselves, the power of reputations means that they can be induced to cooperate.

Selfishness is an assumption, not a statement of fact.
