Too large for Europe but too small for the world?
US was in the ascendancy, home to many German immigrants
Surrounded by hostile powers
1890s attempt for improved commerce; either we export goods or we export people
1900s attempt to create an empire comparable to that of Britain or France
Belated attempts to create their own navy or create a Central European bloc
Tensions build for a while but explode in the First World War
War understood principally as an Anglo-German clash also understood as a racial clash

Needed to circumvent naval blockade; decisions made on GDP, but this is based on peacetime assumptions of the economy
In war, economics are very different; no guarantee you can get food
German GDP in fact lower after the war, in stark contrast to their enemies, which were still plugged into the German system
Treaty of Versailles 1919; Germany loses all overseas colonies
Alsace-Lorraine lost; territory lost to Denmark and Poland, and a vast reparations bill
Hunger in Berlin, 1919. Hitler argues that Germany is a colony of the allies and international finance capitalism. Germany is a ‘plantation’

Germany no longer Aryan, and also no longer running the world. A ‘have-not’ power
Blames this on divisions rising from Westphalia many centuries ago
Jewish people synonymous with international capitalism, and agitate nations that reject this e.g. Bolsheviks

Desire for Lebensraum
Colonies no good as the British will simply cut them off. Instead, Lebensraum has to be contiguous
Greater living standard; idea of a German dream to mimic the United States
Underlining this is a racial conception: antisemitism; purification of ‘German racial strands’

Introduces “gradual” exclusionary policies
Initial idea of evolutionary change in Germany
Balance of power necessary for peace according to the Germans

FDR makes a speech saying that Fascism must be crushed; Hitler feels targeted and feels the international tools of power are turning against him
Hitler begins to regard Jewish people as hostages in exchange for the good behaviour of the United States
Spring of 1941: Hitler controls much of mainland Europe, and still is on good terms with Stalin.
Still seems possible that there could be a global anti-American alliance.

However, Hitler finds himself in a quandary as he had failed to subdue the British or convince the Soviets to do so
Americans continue to supply the British with military aid
Purpose to attack the Soviets not even really to destroy them, but rather for Lebensraum, and to provide enough resources to outlast a blockade

Dec 1941: attack on Pearl Harbour, so Hitler decides to declare war on the United States was a window of opportunity
Hostages now to be killed
