## Governing the global commons

The term **global commons** refers to areas and resources that are not subject to the actions of several nations and states.

Implications of sovereignty:
1. States do not recognise any superior authority
2. Authority is organised on the bases of mutually exclusive jurisdiction

Free-ride problem: cooperation is beneficial but hard to combine. Game theory is an analytical approach that examines strategic interactions among rational decision makers.

Game theories and the arguments it is based on is based on theoretical approaches to explain international projects often described as liberal internationalism - the idea of rationality in game theory is different from rationality in liberalism

Certain outcomes, how to get there, trying to optimise the results. This model on utility maximisation has been expanded over time - two quick examples, one by introducing assumptions of human behaviour. Are we a utility maximiser or utility satisfier? Sometimes, life happens, we're busy - we've got shit to write so we write 'good enough' essays.

An extension of this model is to do these things, getting to an aim that is acceptable. Often liberals will draw on these examples for how these institutions may cooperate. The other very important distinction is liberalism at the end as a normative core - liberals believe that everyone is equal, should be equal, should guarantee human freedom. Game theory is more neutral on what the values actually are.

Game theoretical models assume that international institution (law, organisations, etc.) change the context in which actors make decisions:
1. Institutions reduce transaction costs, facilitate repeat interactions and allow for issue linkages.
2. States create and design institutions to advance their interests. Institutions only work well if they solve the underlying **collective action problem** which depends on the number (heterogeneity of actors) and the type of good involved, among other things.


In most real world scenarios, participants engage in what resemble mixed-motive games where players have conflicting and cooperative interests:
1. Non-cooperation games: players do not communicate and face incentives to defect from collaboration with any agreement being self-enforcing
2. Coordination or assurance games - players can communicate, have an incentive to collaborate (battle of the sexes, stag hunt)

Non-cooperative games - prisoners dilemma. The optimum point, people are collectively worse off. The dominant strategy is individually rational but collectively undesirable

Battle of sexes, Nash equilibrium are Pareto equilibrium - battle of the sexes (term).

Coordination game: the Montreal Protocol.
1. Signatory states agree to limit the trade of ozone depleting substances exclusively to parties. Parties commit to phasing down the consumption and production of ODSs, with distinct timetables for developing and developed countries
2. The Montreal Protocol, along with its subsequent modifications, is generally considered a success, contributing to the recovery of the Earth's ozone layer.

## Common Pool Resources

The political scientist Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012) received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2009) for her work on the governance of the commons. Her work shows that Hardin’s ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ is incorrect, as local communities often govern and manage ‘common pool resources’ efficiently and sustainably, emphasizing the role of institutions such as cultural norms for coordinating collective action.

```ad-quote
title: In Mare Liberum (1609), Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) argued for the freedom of the high seas in defense of Dutch privateering and trade interests in Southeast Asia.
‘The first [reason] is, **that that which cannot be occupied, or which never has been occupied**, **cannot be the property of any one, because all property has arisen from occupation**. The second is, that all that which has been so constituted by nature that although serving some one person it still suffices for the common use of all other persons, is today and ought in perpetuity to remain in the same condition as when it was first created by nature…**All things which can be used without loss to anyone else come under this category**’.

```

```ad-example
title: Are the high seas really a public good? States have different conceptions about the law of the seas...
The United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982) established a regime of differentiated state authority over coastal waters, including the Exclusive Economic Zone that extends 200 nautical miles from the baseline.

The Antarctic treaty (1959) ‘freezes’ states’ territorial claims, restricting land use to peaceful purposes (mainly science).


## Conclusions
1. Collective action problems are common in international politics
2. Game theoretical models suggest that institutions (organisations, treaties, norms) help solve collective action problems
3. The nature of a collective problem depends, among other things, on actors' preferences and the type of good involved. Common-pool resources are difficult (but not impossible) to govern.
4. Critique: 'problem solving' without actually addressing the source of the problem?
