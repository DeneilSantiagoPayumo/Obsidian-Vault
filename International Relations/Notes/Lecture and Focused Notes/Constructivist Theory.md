## Introducing Constructivist Theory in International Relations

Liberal Institutionalism starts with the same premise as Realism, only that they reach a much more optimistic conclusion.

Constructivism is different. It is much more inspired from theories of Sociology or Social Anthropology, and is quite different from economic logic of the prior two theories. 

According to Realism, there is a presumption of sameness. Anarchy is the backbone of international politics. There is a critique - anarchy can have different phases. Even if international politics is hierarchal, it can be highly differentiated across time, historical context or even place. For Constructivists, there is an emptiness to Anarchy. You could have a 'lock-in' anarchy where states are competitors but not violent ones, you could even have a 'Kantian' anarchy where all the states are friends and the dynamics are completely different.

So, we move onto new theories then.

Most of the mileage about discussing international politics is identity and interests. Behaviour is derivative, second down the chain and less important. We want to explain who actors are and what they want.

How do we explain identity and interests?

Identity is relational - they start with this thought experiment about the 'encounters of the first time': they say that identities are relational because in international politics a lot of the relationships you have are either as a friend, ally, enemy, arrival, superior, subordinate and so on. 

For the Constructivist theorists, interaction comes before identity and interests - they say, let's look at the idea of friend and friendship. In a place where there are no actors, or just one, there can be no friends. Here, there is more than one state and more than one person: imagine you encounter someone for the first time, there will be no police and no guarantee that the other person will kill you.

Constructivists would argue that is ridiculous and paranoid to assume that from the get-go. If you interact with a stranger on friendly terms, you may eventually become friends - and it becomes a part of an identity. For the first encounter, this could go well or it could go wrong. The main part is that we just don't know, we don't know anything about the character of this relationship.

Under this idea of inter-subjectivity, there must this idea of collectivist - thoughts of sharing something beyond one person.

So far so contrived.

To be a sovereign you must be recognised as a sovereign. National identity must have a collective - not something in the contents of one person's head, but something more. Look at borders. Passports, national identity, borders. All of these are based on social facts.


## Applications of Constructivism

Look at two countries that have nuclear weapons - Britain and North Korea - and their relationships with the US.

Why would the US be concerned about North Korean weapons if they can't reach the US whereas they're relaxed about Britain? The answer is obvious to everyone except Realists - Britain and the US are friends, whereas US and North Korea are enemies. The question is not who has how many bombs, it is the relations between these countries. If Realism were true, every set of neighbouring country of the world, we would have this security dilemma between them. Most countries are on reasonable terms with one another.

Identities of friendship - we've got to work out *who* actors are, the product of interaction and the product of identity. According to Realists, we have this pervasive insecurity - the first mistake could be your last, so on and so forth. This describes almost nothing of what we've seen: one of the most notable trends is that there are a lot more states than there just used to be.

Once identities are set, they're sticky and hard to change. They think that the Cold War is an identity formed through interaction that is locked. The US formed their identity as anti-communist. The USSR formed their identity as anti-capitalist. Yet under Gorbachev and the soviet union, they managed to overlook this: doing radical things that helped shape the interactions between the Soviet Union.

It was not the military balance that changed thing. It was just a change of identities through interaction that changed behaviour.

Look at the tributary system in [[China and East Asia]] where the tributary system meant that they could make peaceful relations, instead of security dilemmas or so on. Legitimacy was defined as being faithful and being deferent. 

Look at the slave trade in [[African International Politics]] where the US couldn't overwhelm Africa through material power, and just had to depend on interactions within Africa. Europeans believed it was non-legitimate to enslave Europeans but wanted to enslave non-Europeans.

What transforms history is a changing of identity and a changing of what behaviours was legitimate there.

## Conclusion

Theory is a simplifying lens for a complex world.

Constructivism bets on ideas and culture.

The power of norms.

Making and re-making the world through relations. This is something that can be made and re-made: the world we do have is not the world we will always have.
