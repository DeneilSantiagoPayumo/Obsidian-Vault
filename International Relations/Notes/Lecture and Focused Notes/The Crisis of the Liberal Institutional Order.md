# The Crisis of the Liberal International Order? The West
## Lecture notes

Neoliberalism - improving the world through institutions, rational action, capitalism, international organisations and democracy.

Conflicts can be avoided through changing incentives for actors!

Markets, but interdependence - securities, trade deficits.

IOs but also international law - human rights treaties.

Democratic peace theories.

Origins? League of Nations. Kellogg-Briand pact (1928). Yalta Conference, Bretton Woods conference. NATO vs Warsaw pact.

After Cold War sense of Western victory ... Meanwhile, Tiananmen Square, 1998 financial crisis, 1991 failed coup.

Liberal victors can win the peace by showing "strategic restraint" and building "constitutional orders". Liberal order can survive beyond US hegemony.

But now... Everyone thinks the liberal world order is declining! What happened? (Iraq, Afghanistan, 9/11, War on Terror).

Success seems elusive (Trump, 2016).

# The Crisis of the Liberal International Order? Russia and other Discontents

Trump presidency - Can the Democrats stop Trump! Are we living in Putin's world?
Rising US-China tensions.
China's Communist party toughens Taiwan rhetoric.

What caused the crisis?
(IR) Liberal Optimism - all countries want to join liberal order, increase membership in institutions, decrease barriers to trade, spread democracy, crisis is a surprise, protect human rights -> human intervention.

Why was liberalism ill-equipped?

Congress system / concert of Europe -> league of nations -> liberal international order -> liberal international order (global).

Historical tunnel vision in IR approaches - misattribution of causality, impression that Western order must keep improving and expanding. 

Unforeseen challenges: backlash against Capitalism, free trade, IO, democracy, populism.

Economic grievances - outsourcing, offshoring. Income inequality. Zero hour contracts. Robots replacing jobs.

Socio-political grievances - MAGA, is US in decline, spectre of a rising Japan, financial crisis, back to promises of greatness, cyclical debate?

Material basis? Low appeal. US still high GDP. Now inflation, consumer confidence?

Struggles for recognition - why is there a support for the decline thesis?
Focus on status grievances against the LIO - Core, Semi-Periphery

# The Crisis of the Liberal International Order? China and Alternative Orders

Who are the discontents? Core - voters in the west attached to the existing hierarchy (undermining status), semi-peripheral countries (not delivering status!)

Liberal international order is the common enemy. Neither group is the most disadvantaged.

The merger: why now? Decline of ideology, increase in agency, Russia, ease of communication.

Has Russia’s attack brought NATO closer together?

Is Russia dividing or uniting the West? Can China bring us together?

Difference with China: more of a chance of a continuation of a rules-based order?

Answer: bond between China and Russia, China condemns US veto of call for immediate ceasefire at UN. Chinese research ships in Taiwan. Belt and Road initiative?

More of a worry around Taiwan than Ukraine?

Teleological perspective of liberal internationalism

Historical “tunnel vision”: misattribution of causality; impression that the Western order must keep improving and expanding

Huge underestimation of scale of resentment

Populism, positing a fundamental opposition between “people” and the “elite”; usually a binary division

Outsourcing and offshoring increasing discontent, plus rising income inequality

Socio-political grievances: general concern about an unspecified “decline”

Is the US actually in decline?

Still a military and economic hegemon

Concerns about decline arguably cyclical; similar feelings in the 1970 s

2000 s: “New American Century”, until crisis of 2008

Voters in the West attached to the existing hierarchy and semi-peripheral countries acting against the hierarchy

A group of female alumnae of a Tokyo university whom I interviewed   asserted that the nightlife Japanese men enjoy at company expense is about work, not sex. When I asked them to elaborate, none revealed any knowledge; and they preferred to remain uninformed about the details of their husbands’ nocturnal jaunts. (104)

Although the absent husband/father was mentioned in most of the women's accounts of sarariiman family life, few women expressed such an intense  longing for their husbands. Many are resigned, like Nakamura, to the family’s truncations, attributing their inevitability to Japanese corporate practices. Others speak of their mother-focused families without any mention of  loss, impoverishment, or regret. For these women, the removed husband/ father is a fact of life; for some, it’s even preferred.
