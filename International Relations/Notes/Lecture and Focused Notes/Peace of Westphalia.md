## The Classic View of Westphalia

Classics texts argue that the treaty of Westphalia in 1648 is the idea of the sovereign state and the modern state systems.

The texts in 1648 had alliances with the German emperor and so on. This has led to some important scholars. The German princes here are now allowed to form alliances with the Holy Roman Emperor.

Holsti and Philpott - boundaries of international law originated in Westphalia but not so: now the treaty of Westphalia is a system of conditional and not absolute sovereignty - in this intervention was encouraged, not discouraged.

Powers were given the right to do sovereignty and if not, the system wouldn't work.

To explain this, you must go back 100 years before.

### HRE governing structure:
1. Emperor
2. Seven secular and spiritual prince electors
3. Margraves
4. Dukes
5. Landgraves
6. Burgraves

The Roman empire was a loose confederation made up of many different territories - hundreds of actors in this empire.

This empire is governed in a complex way - the emperor at the top, the seven prince electors next of, some of them secular or spiritual and so on (the others aren't important). The main aforementioned actors are elected, not obtaining it through hereditary means.

This is against a messy and complex backdrop of violence: the Habsburg-Valois conflict, and the Ottoman Turks' advance which involved the defeat of King of Hungary. At the same time, key figures of Calvin and Zwingli inspired the Protestant revolution. In Europe, many of the actors were Catholic.

By the mid-1600 centuries, the map gets even more complex.

We've got two religions camps facing north facing each other.

In Germany, it's even worse.
In Germany, unlike most countries, Germany is split down the middle - a northern and southern Protestant part of Germany, and so on.
(Look at the map above)

Reformations used by political actors as a state making project - used by individual actors to contest against their rulers, consolidate, a monarch would have to take on one religion or the other.

The reformations (for example by England) used were used to advance their own political agenda - reward supporters within the principalities
The Protestant system was used to contest against rulers and systems.

Geopolitical terms - these are new, as ideological affinities now spread across state borders. Germans had liberties for Princes not to be dominated by their Emperor.

## Resolution

How to resolve: 1555 - Treaty of Augsberg: simply means whoever rules is the person who in turn returns the religion of the state. And then the secularisation of Church lands - if you seized the church lands, you can do whatever the hell you want it, and made the Lutheranism and Catholicism equal.

Problems:
1. Did not consider the conversion princes
2. Did not consider succession disputes between Protestant and Catholic claimants
3. As an elective monarchy, the ruler had a huge impact on the fundamental nature of the holy roman empire.
4. No concessions for Calvinists
5. Catholic emperor tried to consolidate power in territories, seeing problems in Bohemia

All this, which is complex and deadly... is further aggravated by geopolitics.
Why? European powers see Germany as a key space in Geopolitics: look at Germany, it's at the heart of Europe - it matters particularly for the Dutch protestants and they supply their armies... the problems is I have a cut off from supplying their troops in the low countries.

Senior Spanish diplomat in 1618: if one loses Germany, they would lose the low countries and Italy.

30 years war erupts in 1618 as Frederick wants to become King of Bohmeia, creating a German civil war.

What is the solution... again?
It has to deal with the problem in three elements:
1. It must address religious and political issues (How to deal with succession, calvinists, for example) *within* territories
2. Settlement must be between the princes, and between the princes and emperor.
3. There must be an agreement of European powers over Germany and how it's run and to ensure Germany must not be solely run by a single state.

This treaty is known as the treaty of Westphalia.

First, there will be tolerations for all three confessions - ending the idea that the ruler determines so on, it goes for alternate rulers, shared spaces, subjects have spare rights to tolerate their religion and these rights are enforced by religious forces. The ruler does not determine state religion.

For religious purposes, you must have a compromise. This is an early modern form of assocations. There are shared religious states

Reichstag would hold court for princely dispute; compromise is necessary as 50/50 assumed no matter the true numbers.

Finally, the meta-level, all of this was to be under international guarantees (Sweden and France) and they guarantee that nothing will happen in Germany that will be against their interests. 

This is a system based on conditional sovereignty and implicit and legally sanctioned interventions.

## Does it work?

The war between France and Spain (and England) lasts another ten years.
The treaty of Westphalia however was not designed to end that war so... yay!

Conflict within the HRE remained.

It was intended to contain geopolitics for Germany.
In geopolitical terms, Germany was domed to be constantly fought over.

It took the Franco-Spanish war and the internal rights of individuals were realized by this treaty.

A catholic ruler would know that if I lead against my subjects, they would turn to the Swedish subjects, making firm the guarantee. Internal rights were guaranteed.

Under this system, arbitrary rulers could be removed, and if became tyrannical could be removed ... an early modern form of power sharing based on intervention than sovereignty.

Detoxified the religious issue; conversions no longer problematic.
## Why does this matter?

Well, it's important to get things right!
It is important in the present day as: somehow, in the course of the 19th and 20th century, the idea that these systems are of sovereignty it encouraged a false assumptions of stability and it was held that the principle of modern intervention led to stability in Germany... but this is not true as intervention led to the pacification

In fact, as we've seen: it was a system of intervention and in the treaty there are many examples for intervention for ideological reasons.
