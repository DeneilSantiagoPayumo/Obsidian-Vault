## The International Human Rights Regime

UN, Global Issues: Human Rights:
	"Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to Work and education, and many more. Everyone is entitled to these rights, without discrimination.â€™"

This regime has been developed through time:
1. The **Universal Declaration of Human Rights** (HR) (UDHR, 1948)
2. 9 core **human rights treaties**
3. **United Nations Human Rights Council (2006)**, the **Office of the High Commissioners for Human Rights** (1993), and the **International Criminal Court** (2002)
4. **Regional human rights systems** (Americas, Africa, and Europe)

## Legitimacy and efficacy

1. **Conventional histories** trace the origins of international human rights to Western political traditions
2. In this view, the **UDHR** (1948) marked the beginning of the modern, international human rights regime; **it was a (US-led) response to the atrocities of the Holocaust and WWII.**
3. The regime then expanded and become increasingly legalised and institutionalised (especially in the 1990s).


```ad-quote
The Rights of Man ... had been defined as "inalienable" because they were supposed to be independent of all governments; but it turned out that **the moment human beings lacked the own government and had to fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect them and no institution was willing to guarantee them."** (*Origins of Totalitarianism*, pp. 291-292, emphasis added)

"For, contrary to the best-intentioned humanitarian attempts to obtain new declarations of human rights from international organizations, it should be understood that this idea transcends the present sphere of international law which still operates in terms of reciprocal agreements and treaties between between sovereign states; and, for the time being, **a sphere that is above the natiions does not exist.**". (ibid, p 298, emphasis added)
```

## Theoretical Critiques

1. **Androcentrism**: human rights are gendered and based on the experience of men (Feminism)
2. **Anthropocentrism***: human rights evolved from a (Western) human-centred point of view that fails to protect and/or legitimises the exploitation of other species and the environment (posthumanism)
3. **Ethnocentrism**: human rights reflect the values and interests of the Western world (postcolonialism)
4. **Neoliberalism**: human rights are a hindrance to social and political justice

[[Kathryn Sikkink]] (Evidence for Hope, 2017):
1. "Comparisons to the ideal" entail unrealistic expectations
2. The international human rights regime developed through '**contentious politics**' and bottom-up pressures for change
3. **Transnational advocacy networks**: Constructivists focus on persuasion, 'naming and shaming', and norm internalization.

## International Human Rights

1. International human rights expanded (and institutionalised) starting with the UNDH in 1948
2. Human rights have a contested history (the *legitimacy* question)
3. The *enforcement* problem is often exaggerated (human rights are not inter- or supranationally enforced)
