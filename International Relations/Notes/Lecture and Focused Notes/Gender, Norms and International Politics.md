## The concept of norms

A shared standard of appropriate behaviour for a given actor in a given context. It is a typically constructivist concept.

Contrast this with rational action - instrumental maximizing means-ends. Norms have logic of appropriateness whereas rational actions have the logic of consequences.

There are many regulative and constitutive norms - gender as a social construct or social fact and people comply with them for many reasons: habit, internal emotion and external peer pressure.

### [[Finnemore and Sikkink's]] Norm Life-Cycle

IR really neglects gender. This constructivist article is quite important thereof.

Norms can change - for instance, consider women's suffrage to slavery to the de-colonization of same-sex marriage.

They argue there is a 3-stage norm life-cycle:
1. Emergence: Norm entrepreneurs and persuasion
2. Cascade: tipping point and the S-Curve, the shift from domestic to international drivers, seeking legitimacy
3. Internalization: socialization, institutionalization and conformity, law and habit.

## Towns: Women in Politics and the Standard of Civilization

A different international perspective: feminist and constructivist. Gender is the classic changing social construct.

Norms change: we debunk the idea of European progressives.

We change the conception of gender: from one sex to two.

IR theory discusses how women are neglected from politics, where did suffrage come from for example.

Let's consider Afghanistan: the crucible of the international politics of women's participation in politics.

Non-compliance with norms on women's rights: largely uncolonized, forced gender equality through Marxism, the Taliban suppressing women's rights, and intervention later...

Now: Afghan women banned from education, restriction on movements. We condemn them. Why non-compliance? Strength or weakness of international norms on women's participation in politics?

# Conclusion

Norms as an alternative rationality

Gender as a changing social construct

The norm life-cycle and the standard of civilization

A difficult choice: universal human rights or refusing to impose Western values on non-Western societies.
