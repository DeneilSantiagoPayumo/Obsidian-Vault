# The Cold War: Origins and the 'end of history'

### Origins of the Cold War (1917-1950)
- October Revolution (1917) ➞ Russian Civil War and Western Intervention ➞ creation of the Union of Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922.
- The USSR became a member of the League of Nations in 1934; they were expelled in 1939 due to aggression against Finland.
- Non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany (Molotov-Ribbentrop or Hitler-Stalin Pact, 1939; its secret protocol became known to the public in 1945).
- The USSR joined the Allies in WWII in 1941. However, the delay in opening a second (Western) front contributed to the deterioration of inter-allied relations. It also strengthened the view in the USSR that its security required a ‘cordon sanitaire’ in Central and Eastern Europe.
- The USSR refused to withdraw from territories they had captured during WWII. Western powers supported anti-communist/Soviet forces (Greece, Iran, Korea, etc.).
1. 1946: Winston Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech
2. 1947: Kennan’s ‘Long Telegram’; Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan; creation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
4. 1948-1949: Soviet-backed coup in Czechoslovakia; Berlin Blockade.
5. 1949: creation of NATO; the USSR detonated its first atomic bomb.
6. 1950: the Korean People’s Army crossed the 38th parallel (Korean War).

### End of the Cold War (1985-1991)
- Breshnev dies in 1982. Mikhail Gorbachev assumes the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party (➞ glasnost and perestroika) in 1985.
- Revolutions of 1989: Pro-democracy demonstrations in Central and Eastern Europe (esp. Poland and Czechoslovakia) and the GDR.
- Fall of the Berlin Wall (1989); restoration of independence in Central and Eastern Europe; abortive soviet intervention in the Baltic states (1991); failed coup and dissolution of the USSR (1991).

### The 'end of history'?
- The end of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy
- 1990s period of decline in quality of life
- Two Plus Four Treaty (1990) allowed for a reunified Germany to remain in NATO. Further NATO expansion ensued. In 1991, the Visegad Group formed (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) seeking EU and NATO membership.
- Vladimir Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as President of the Russian Federation in 2000

### Explanation

*Material explanations* focus on **the cost of superpower competition** and the Soviet Union's inability to keep up economically. Glasnot and Perestroika were attempts to gain 'breathing space'.
Realists - did not transform great power politics

**Decision-making models**, ideas, and ideologies centre on the nature of political leadership, institutions and procedures (miscalculations, biases, heuristic, etc.) 

**Constructivist** explanations centre on the importance of ideas and socially constructed meanings - ideological conflict. Ended with the removal of Communism as an ideological threat or proper alternative.

A **postcolonial** reading of the end of cold war foregrounds local agency, the colonial logics of Soviet rule and the continuation of different forms of domination - criticizing the 'Western' portrayal of Central and Eastern Europe as secondary or marginally European as well as neglect by postcolonial scholars of Russian imperialism.
