## Lecture notes:

Why the state again? 

States are even more important with the end of empires, c.3/4 of the world’s states are post-colonial states, states are the central focus of many IR theories

Looking at the relationship between changes in the international system and changes in the nature of states, Finnemore more the former, Jackson more the latter, but two sides of the same coin

The need to get beyond Eurocentrism in explanations of the state, changes between the early modern period and the 20th and 21st centuries (Tilly and Spruyt)

Connections with previous lectures: state formation, de-colonization, regulating force

### European States and the International System

Recapping Tilly: the reciprocal and recursive relationship between state-making and war

Darwinian international military competition forced rulers to extract more and more resources to fight wars, over time created a standing army, tax and bureaucratic administration

The state then diffused in Europe as the model through learning, emulation and elimination by conquest

Spruyt: competition was more economic than military, states were most successful at generating wealth through facilitating trade and exchange

Diffusion of the state in Europe through learning, emulation, and movement of people and money

### From Europe to the World, From States to Quasi-States?

Tilly: post-colonial states as weak and incapable, their armies focus inwards rather than outwards

Tilly and Jackson: post-colonial weak states created and survive because international system no longer allows wars of conquest and colonisation, no international struggle for survival (Zacher norm of territorial integrity)

Negative and positive sovereignty, quasi-states and states, law and practice

Quasi-states from above: an international safety net for post-colonial states?

The inversion of Hobbes: international politics as law-ruled, domestic politics as anarchical (e.g. Somalia)

Critiques of Jackson: blaming the post-colonial victims? Safety net or neo-colonialism?

### Finnemore and Changing Norms on International Intervention

Like Tilly, Jackson and Zacher, Finnemore sees fundamental change in the international system connected with the decline of war, conquest and colonialism

Constructivism and intervention as a window on the international system and state sovereignty: how has the use of force changed in the international system, what explains these changes?

Why did ‘national interest’ mandate conquering colonies at one time, and then forbid colonies at another?

States’ interests and hence use of force change in line with changes in international norms
A general decline in the international use of force
The rise of peaceful, legal international dispute resolution

Critique: how does the invasion of Ukraine square with norms against conquest?

### Changing Forms of Intervention: From Gunboat Diplomacy to R2P

Changes in form: old interventions disappear, new ones appear

Gunboat diplomacy: the use or threat of force between
States to resolve commercial disputes (loans, property) 

The end of gunboat diplomacy: sovereign equality, norm of non-
Intervention, the rise of international lawyers

Humanitarian intervention and Responsibility to Protect (R2P), 
C19th Ottoman Empire to Libya 2011

Expanding human rights, conditional sovereignty, mixed motives?

### Conclusions

Big changes in the international system have produced big changes in the nature of sovereign states

The end of empires and the decline of war has produced a new type of state that does not face survival pressure, in contrast to older states shaped by war

(Quasi) new states are weaker, with a disconnect between juridical sovereignty and government control, inverting Hobbes

How friendly is this supposedly new international system for post-colonial states? Do new sovereignty and new interventions represent progress? Post-colonial critiques

The realist response: international politics is the same as ever, war just as important as ever
