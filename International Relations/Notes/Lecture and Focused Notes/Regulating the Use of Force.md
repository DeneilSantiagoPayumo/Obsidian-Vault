## Regulating the use of force

The laws of war comprise of two bodies of international law:
1. *Jus ad bellum* refers to the conditions under which States may resort to war or to the use of armed force
2. *Jus in bello* regulates the conduct of parties engaged in armed conditions

### *Jus ad bellum*

- Historically, war was generally permitted under the **just war doctrine**.
- The League of Nations (LON) mandated member states to pursue peaceful conflict resolution and uphold the 'territorial integrity' of member states (Art. 10). **Collective security**: states found in breach were 'deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League" (Art. 16). The LoN Covenant also created the **Permanent Court of International Justice.**'
- Efforts to **outlaw** war during the interwar period,, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 and the Saavedra Lamas Treaty of 1933, failed.
- At the Nuremberg (1945-1946 and Tokyo (1946) trials, German and Japanese leaders were prosecuted for planning an **attack war**, violating the wars and customs of law, and **crimes against humanity**

The UN Charter (1945) contains a **general prohibition of the use of force**:
	Art. 2 (4) : "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."

The UN Charter recognises only **two exceptions**:
1. Individual and collective self-defence (Art. 51)
2. When sanctioned by the UN Security Council in cases of 'threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression' (Chapter VII).


### Jus in bello
1. Starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, humanitarians and governments advocated for the codification of **jus in bello** norms leading to the "Lieber Code" (1864) and, First Geneva Convention (1864), and Hague Conventions (1899, 1907) -> **International Humanitarian Law**
2. International humanitarian law is embodied in the four **Geneva Conventions of 1949**, their additional protocols, and the rules of customary law.

The core principles of IHL are *humanity*, *discrimination proportionality, military necessity.*

## (Why) has war declined?

### Regulating the use of force

"Believe it or not - and I know that most people do not - violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species existence."

#### Explanations:
Realism:
- (US) hegemonic stability
- Alliance politics

Liberal Institutionalist:
- Self-interest; economic and societal interdependence
- Institutions enable states to pursue and realise their interests

Constructivism:
- Norms influence behaviour: territorial integrity, the prohibition of the use of force, etc.
- 'Security communities' and other trust-based relationships between groups of states.

## Conclusions
- Norms (legal or otherwise) regulate the use of force of international politics
- International law distinguishes between *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*,.
- Norms have **regulative, enabling** and **constitutive** function.
