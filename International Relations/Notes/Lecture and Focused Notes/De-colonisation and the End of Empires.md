## Decolonisation as a process and political project

We use the term decolonization in multiple terms:

1. A historical process of dismantling (formal) colonial rule leading to the creation of independent states
2. An ongoing uncompleted emancipatory project that aims to overcome the legacy of colonialism, including its political, economic and cultural forms of domination

Overthrowing and dismantling forms of domination that can very subtle and informal.

## Four waves

1. The independence of the Untied States, Haiti and the Spanish American republics **challenged prevailing notions of legitimate statehood** (popular sovereignty vs dynasticism; de jure versus de facto recognition) 

Popular sovereignty - the rejection of dynasticism, the legitimacy of a state that does not depend on the family ties of the rulers and *de jure versus de facto recognition* - a state exists independent of a state recognising of other states recognising its independence. Diplomatic recognition from Britain and France does not mean that a state is independent, moreover that it simply has been recognised.

Spanish American countries settled their boundaries according to the principle of *uti possidetis juris* (as you possess under law), that became a model for decolonization as newly independent states inherited previous administrative colonial boundaries.

Very little regard of the actual political identities of people heralded on the ground. In part, this was considered a relatively successful module that formed the national consciousness of these countries.

This process was not linear - during the 19th century, European powers, Japan and the US expanded their control over parts of Africa and Asia ('new imperialis, 1885-1914)

Ideologies of progress rationalised colonial expansion ([[Buzan and Lawson]] 2015) Thus, national liberation movements increasingly mobilised against colonialism and the ideas that sustained it. Think thus Evolutionism, Functionalism and more.

2. **The "Big Four" at the Paris Peace Conference** (Britain Italy, France and the US) contributed to this. Wilson's 14-points speech promised an "impartial adjustment of colonial claims" that respected the interest of local populations. **Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh)** in Paris later led Vietnam's struggle for national liberation against Japan, the US and France under the banner of Communism. **Vladimir Lenin was also here.

In the Paris Peace conference, many colonies petitioned for independence (see Ho Chi Minh). Others petitioned in the form of the first African congress (see [[W, E. B. Du Bois]]. The fact that the victors of world war one did certain things  often made more radical solutions like socialism and communism more appealing to them.

What came out of world war 1 was not limited to central and eastern Europe but it sort of institutionalised colonial rule with international oversight in the form of the mandate system that transferred the colonies of the defeated by Britain and France. It distinguished between three types of societies: those able to stand on their own feet, those with the capacity for self government and more.

```ad-quote
title: 22 League of Nations Covenant
"To those colonies and territories ... which are inhabited by **peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world**, there should "be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a **sacred trust of civlisation**, and that securities for this performance of trust should be embodied in this Covenant"

```

This continued after WW2 in several terms before being remedied.

3. International organisations (UN) and fora (Bandung Conference, 1995 -> Non-Alignment Movement, 1961-present) served as important **platforms** for demanding an end to colonial rule. How does a poor economy help poor societies, Bandung brought nationalist leaders from decolonised worlds and aligned them together.
3. In 1960, the UN general assembly approved the **declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples** (resolution 1541), formally recognising colonialism as a human rights violation and a threat to international peace and cooperation.

The argument that any colonised people cannot stand on their own feet is thus an invalid statement.

European imperial powers opposed national liberation movements with extreme force - Algeria, Kenya, Indochina and more. Superpower rivalry provided postcolonial movements with external support and resources, but US and Soviet involvement only served to escalate conflict and violence.

### Post-colonialism as a political project

This starts in the early 60s with **neo-colonialism**, an early frustration with nationalist leaders with how decolonisation is being transformed. If you look at the former French colonies in Africa, you will be able to recognise how France has and can exert political, economic, social, military or technical domination.

This is colonialism *after* the end of empire. States thus must find a path that is not capitalist or socialist. This is the theory of the people being the 'third estate' (Sieyes?) One way third leaders do this is negotiate terms of international economy, thinking about forms of commodities, establishing cartels that control supply (OPEC), 

[[Franz Fanon]] - postcolonial theory that centres on the psychological impact of colonialism, emphasising its dehumanising effects on both the coloniser and colonised. In his book, the *Wretched of the Earth* Fanon argued that violent resistance was a logical consequence of colonial violence and necessary for national liberation.

He advocated for the cultural and intellectual emancipation of postcolonial societies.
