Theory directs us to the very few big important thing about Politics - Kenneth Waltz.

## Realist Starting Points:
Realism's historical pedigree pretends to be older than they really are - in pedigree, it claims that it stretches as far as the ancient Greeks, Hobbes or Machiavelli.

In practice, Realism is a creature of the 20th century.
Let's look at [[Kenneth Waltz]] and [[John Mearsheimer]]

Mearsheimer is against the invasion of Iraq, is critical about the US's relationship with Israel, he regards the Russian invasion of Ukraine as largely the West's fault - NATO expansion.

A few starting points: if IR is concerned about states and actors or whatever, that is difficult for Realists: for IR, they're concerned about the state.

Additionally, they're concerned over the military power, seeing it as the main means of international politics - it's what they use, and it's what states are after.

They're also concerned over anarchy as the main character of international politics. Anarchy displays the most important things about International Politics

### Why do wars happen?

We've got three levels (or what he calls images):

1. First is at the mutual level
2. Second is at the level of the state
3. Third is the level of the system.

The mutual level - well, sure, there are just some really bad people out there. Wars happen as a result of the personal deficiencies of the person who happens to be in charge. It's as though there's something inherent in human nature that people emerge towards domination and achieve said domination through violence.

If you look back at human history, violence has always been among us - because war always has been with us in the past, it will be with us in the future.

Some scepticism - IR is not a theory of violence in general. Their job is not to do this. Also, war is exceptional - for the vast majority of time, war is not commonplace: even in the most violent places of the world, war is not occurring. This exception therein seems odd: war is not the exception, so why pretend it as such?

Can we argue for bad states - states with a high propensity to go to war?

Sometimes this is explained through natural character and political history, but that's pretty racist. Also, some regime types are more prone to war. Democracies, as people claim, tend to be more peaceful whereas dictators are more war-like.

A unit level: domestic and internal politics can explain the external behaviour. The power of the state explains how it is war-like or specific. Look at Capitalism.

The most popular Realist explanation - the third image. This assumes that our IR theory is tragic: even in 'good states' and 'good people' war will always break out. Thereof, it's the system. Anarchy will lead to war.

## Fundamental Principles of Realism

We got to keep things simple - domestic politics is vertical, a theory of hierarchy. International anarchy is a horizontal relationship where all states are sovereign, there are no powers above them. Because of this, we live in an anarchic system.

The most important actors - states, most specifically great powers (since they have most of the guns). It's all about insecurity, war.

The third principle - the distribution of power. How is power distributed among a system? How is it dispersed? Unipolar - post-Cold War, bipolar (Cold War), multipolar (C19th Europe)

Realists see anarchy as a state of nature - there is no world government, no state release - war is a frankly dangerous place. Anarchy doesn't mean states are at war against each other, but they should be worried about war. The only thing we can rely on to survive on in states of anarchy is you.

Power is mainly military power, but they do have a role for economic power. It doesn't matter how rich you are if you're not there to enjoy it. The size of your economy determines how big your army is.

Power is relative - a gain for your opponent is a loss for you. It is a zero-sum competition.

## The Security Dilemma under Anarchy

State A feels threatened and decides to build up its military to increase security.
Neighbouring state B feels threatened and builds up its military in response.
State A in turn responds, sparking a cycle of action and reaction - both A and B have larger militaries but feel less secure.

You always have to be suspicious and on your guard in anarchy.
Even if you have these two countries that get together and promise to never invade, cross your heart and hope to die - there is no way of enforcing this. Promises can't be believed. We're in this self-help system.

How might this apply to NATO? NATO got close to the Russian border, with Ukraine and Georgia applying for NATO's membership - you have this hostile alliance creeping on Russia's border. NATO is getting bigger and this makes us less secure, so we embark on this journey of military domination.

In 2008 it invaded Georgia and it invaded Ukraine twice - 2014, 2022. As a reaction to this invasion, Eastern European states got more concerned and NATO got even larger. Rather than rolling back the alliance of NATO, this alliance has become even more important and valued than ever.

## A Realist Perspective on Ukraine

How might Ukrainian dynamics illustrate the purpose of Realist theory?

Ukraine illustrates this abstract situation: Ukraine becomes independent in 1991.
By accident, Ukraine ends up with a lot of Soviet weapons on its territory.
People are worried and Ukraine had a choice: to get rid of, or to keep the nuclear weapons.

States wanted Ukraine to give back the nuclear weapons to Russia.

We need a reassurance: and thus the 1994 Budapest agreement - we promise to give back the nuclear weapons as long as Russia respects the independence of Ukraine, and to never invade it. To guarantee this, the US, Britain, China and France would back them up.

They weren't super enthusiastic about this agreement, especially with the first invasion of Russia in 2014 - they literally didn't help.

The Realist take: you can't rely on other states, you can't rely on broken promises, this is the essential nature of international politics - you simply can't trust other people. If Ukraine had nuclear weapons, they wouldn't have been invaded.

## A Realist Road to Peace? The Balance of Power

There is a caveat to Realist gloom - we can establish peace through the balance of power.

If arms races can start, then Waltz argues that the only form of regularity is the balance of power - promoting a natural equilibrium that can lead to peace. States that are threatened will merge together to shut down a large state.

There are two ways this balancing can occur: either the state builds up their own military capacity (internal balancing), external balancing - states plot together and form coalitions. These alliances last only as far as the threat lasts.

European history is a successive series of power that is defeated by the balance of power.

Realists assume these mechanisms work across all time and space - that the balance of power and security dilemma work together and at all times. There is a fundamentally unchanging view of international politics. International politics works the same in East Asia, in Europe, in Africa, 100 years time would be the exact same. As long as you have anarchy, these things will happen.

## Conclusion

Theory is a simplifying lens to study a complex world.

The key tenets: anarchy, insecurity, self-help, cheap talk, security dilemmas and miltiary power.
