## The Big Question: Have Things Got Better over History?

Exam revision lecture 10am Wednesday 1 May (the secret of exam success: do the reading) 

Framing the big question about progress: have things in international politics got better?

What counts as “better”? Definitely less war, more peace. Arguably, people living longer, healthier, richer and freer lives (but debates and down-sides)

A lecture of two parts to conclude a paper with two aims: international politics, and the scholarly discipline of International Relations

Previous IR scholarship on progress in international politics, and the historical evidence

## Inventing Progress in International Politics c.1800 to 1939

The historical approach: looking at the big picture over a long time to answer big questions

The idea of progress as an invention of European modernity: from God’s world to a world of our making

Progress in the C19th: reason, science, health, wealth, European civilization and empire?

Cosmopolitan capitalists and nationalist masses: War and conquest as unprofitable

## Institutions of Peace and Progress Denied

The League of Nations, collective security, pacifism, disarmament, international courts

Renouncing war: Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928

The Realist response: Munich, Hitler, the Holocaust and atomic weapons

Peace and progress in the Cold War?


## De-colonization as Progress

De-colonization as glass half-full or half-empty?

Ending European empires and overt international racism, the rise of sovereign equality

The disappointments of de-colonization: neo-colonialism, political and economic instability, from independence heroes to post-independence despots

The continuing life-and-death importance of political independence, alternatives and politics as the art of the possible


## Progress at the End of the Cold War and the End of History

The peaceful and surprising end of the Cold War, in  europe and globally

## Pinker and Norberg Pt1: History was Awful

Two strongly optimistic takes on progress over history in international 
Politics and human society (peace, health, wealth, freedom). 

The awfulness of pre-industrial history
-95% of the population in absolute poverty
-frequent famines and deadly pandemics, no medicine
-life expectancy of 25 (48 for nobles)
-war common and glorified
-universal torture, slavery, domestic violence
-bad food, people smelled bad, no toilets

The big change: the Industrial Revolution

Now:

Pinker on war and violence: the great decline, from spanking to international war

Evidence for the decline of war: absence great power conflict, declining military spending, small unarmed states, delegitimation of war

What explains the decline of war? Democratic peace and liberal peace

What could yet go wrong? Nuclear war and climate change, past solutions as future problems

Norberg on explaining skepticism on progress: the media, availability bias, ahistoricism. The more media people consume and the more education they have, the more likely they are to be wrong on big trends
