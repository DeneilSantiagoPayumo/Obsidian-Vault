Notes given by Finley.

Late 1917: Civil war in Russia
Outside intervention to get rid of the Bolsheviks (to try and get Russia back into the war)
Japanese intervene in Siberia

Solution number 1: Await and encourage further European revolutions
Solution number 2: Gain breathing space after ending the war; consolidate power at home
Developing world seen as a reserve
Official language of the Comintern is German; mindset that Germany was ripe for a revolution

Disaster averted for Bolsheviks by 1922; white army defeated, but the Soviet Union remained massively exposed

French believed that Bolshevism was a contagion that needed a buffer zone
Locarno Pact 1925 - mutually guaranteed peace in Western Europe
Upsets the Poles and the Soviets; seen as a direct threat - common Western challenge?
Even more frustrating that Germany was fully integrated into this treaty, thus rejecting Bolshevism
Germans helped by American financiers

Idea of socialism within the country emerged by 1925; this is seen as a short to medium term strategy, not viable in the long run

Inherent assumption that there was an unstoppable march of progress of the working class
Stalin believed that the Bolsheviks needed to speed up time; industrialisation programme aimed for self-sufficiency to allow the Soviets to go to war

Soviet-Japanese border clashes
Aggressive and opportunistic policy in Europe
Annexations 1939-40, Winter War; takes as much as Hitler

Both defensive and emancipatory in the minds of the Soviets

Stalin neither attacks the British nor breaks from the Third Reich, and is in fact providing them with significant economic support

Breach initiated by Hitler, not Stalin

Soviet success on the Eastern Front partly due to buffer perception

Stalin more successful than Hitler in confrontations with Anglo-America, as he walks forth with substantial territorial gain
