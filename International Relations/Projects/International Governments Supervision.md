Is it more convincing to argue that international politics has historically been the same in different regions of the world or that international politics has been fundamentally different in each regions?

Africa and East Asia.

What does it mean to be the same?
We focus on the term 'fundamental' - it goes to show what underlines the core precepts of theories.

For this, I take to assume international politics follow the same general theories.
Can we subscribe to realist positions? Or can we subscribe to norms?
What do we take as fundamental? Constructivism is best suited as an approach: a "heterogamous research approach ... readily combines with different fields and disciplines."  (pg 196, promise of anarchy) It is best suited as an approach, not an explanation or prediction of how international politics will play out:  "constructivism is an approach, not a theory." (ibid).

To be fundamental means to be innately different and impossible to generalise a theory of politics.

We take then the fundamentals of realist or liberal institutionalist theories. They begin from the same standpoint and branch off in different views.

How can we assume states to be the same in either a realist or liberal institutionalist point of view? No, can we apply the fundamentals of each position to the thing. 

Role of assumptions?

Realist assumptions: all states are deeply afraid, every man for itself. No guarantee to work, just the idea of war being a constant. Even smaller nations can attack bigger nations, self interested actors.

What fundamentals from realist or liberal institutionalist theory can we apply?

#### Addressing Latin America, a realist perspective

The importance of war and military action, the idea of false promises. The anarchy and state of nature.

Latin America, a realist perspective:
"Spain and Spanish America proves proof of the cost of independence: the two regions suffered political chaos, economic decline, economic imperialism and foreign intervention. There was no simple solution for nations whose economies had been destroyed by war." - The Emancipation of America

 A striking feature of the scene is that the sedentary people put up armies that did worse than poorer, less numerous, more mobile people.
 European superiority showed itself in large battles on level ground.
 The sedentary people are not mobile.
 The more mobile people did not have to stand and fight. They could melt away almost at will without losing too much and could easily mount surprise counterattacks of various kinds.
 They were more skilled in war and had better weapons due to their hunting background.
 When conquered, they could not live as before. (Thing of the Indies, 315)

Addressing the argument from the start: military action is uncertain thus the most powerful states that can have control of territory is more important, uncertainty: people can create war for any reason whatsoever - Paraguay, for instance

The political revolution of the Spanish world began with the imperial crisis of 1808 - the collapse of the Spanish Monarchy triggered events that culminated in the establishment of representative government throughout the Spanish world: the first step is the formation of local governing *juntas* which invoked the Spanish legal principles that sovereignty, in absence of the king, reverted to the people.

Events in Spain had massive effects in the new world - not willing to accept French domination, the people opposed the invaders, forming a government of national defence. The Spanish national government could not defeat the French without the aid of its overseas territories. The new regime recognized the equality of the American kingdoms and in 1809 invited them to elect representatives to the Junta Central. (141 - Emancipation of America) 

#### Addressing Japan, a realist perspective:

[[The Company and the Shogun, The Dutch Encounter with Tokugawa Japan]], [[Harmony and War, Confucian Culture and Chinese Power Politics]] 

Page 6: existence of containment, superiority, self-interested nature, page 9 - looking for chinks in one another's argument. Across the region the more common narrative was that of containment, that even weapons can be stripped away from them. These Europeans were forced to rely on negotiation, petition and appeal to carve out a limited space for their operations.

Page 9: Sanjay Subrahmanyam (Chinks in armour)

Europeans only attacked China and dominated it when they had the opportunity to, when their power developed: This order came to an end only when the European society of states began to impose its own type of international society on East Asia. Before, there was only implications of subordination. [[International Orders in the Early Modern World, Before the Rise of the West.]]

Essentially, violence broke out by any time to gain land and power. 

### How are they fundamentally different?

[[International Norm Dynamics and Political Change]]

East Asia: in this approach, the prospect of norms might be important. Norms are different, Confucian values internally determine external international values (look at Confucian values). 

137 Emancipation of America, determined by geography, determines norms? British America, Spanish America, France, split colonies and ideas. Africa, the trade of slaves rather than territory. Westphalia,

Blood and Debt - 167 context is important, physical conditions important, difference between European and other sorts of power? What's the difference, strands of violence? 

Underdevelopment of the state, ethnic populations, lacking a common ancestor and shared trials, Latin American patriotism remained wedded to concrete places and people and did not develop into the institutionalized worship of an abstract identity that is at the heart of nationalism.

Emancipation of America:
Two competing political traditions emerged, emphasizing strong executive power and the other insisting on the pre-eminence of the legislature - they epitomized a fundamental disagreement about the nature of government. New Spain, achieving independence through political compromise, is representative of the civil tradition. there, the Hispanic system evolved.

In contrast, military force liberated northern South America - the men of arms dominated men of law. The three newly independent South American nations established strong centralist governments with powerful chief executives and weak legislatures. The Southern Cone did not fall under the control of military men - there, warfare with royalist forces has been limited and most of the fighting that occurred among provinces that struggled for autonomy from their capital cities. 146 Consent or conflict. Rule under an iron thumb.

Can we attack with Alexis de Tocqueville?

Conclusion:
Constructivism argument, obviously based on assumptions - what creates states, does war build states

Constructivist approach may be more fulfilling than a rational approach, but it is incorrect to generalize sections of international politics to certain time periods: too far, and it is too deterministic, and too short and it is too distinct. Realist theories about the general structure will always measure unsatisfactory if not taken in conjunction with Constructivist approaches. Therefore, this essay is inadequate in exploring how both approaches can be explored to create a unified theory.

In reality, we might need to consider
