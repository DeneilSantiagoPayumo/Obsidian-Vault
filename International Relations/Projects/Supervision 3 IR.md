Will China replace the United States in the twenty-first century as the world’s dominant power? Discuss with reference to one of the three main International Relations theories (Lectures 5, 8, 9, 25)

Although US hegemony is fading away, an eroding of the legitimacy of the LIO (liberal-based international order), that does not necessarily imply that China will supplant it. Instead, scholarly evidence suggests that China, as they will benefit from this LIO, will come to do co-exist with the US. To evidence this, we cannot use a purely realist or purely liberal institutional framework: there are elements of both, conflict and otherwise.

To start, we will write of the evidence that supports the co-existence idea: [[After Liberal Hegemony, The Advent of a Multiplex World Order]] After Liberal Hegemony that suggests that neither China or any BRIC will be able to take advantage of this crisis in the liberal order. In many ways, instead of a bipolar or singular system, we must approach the world conflict in terms of a multiplexity.

This evidence is backed up by [[China and the Liberal International Order, A Pragmatic and Dynamic Approach]] China and the Liberal International Order. They are not revisionist, they are pragmatic, vs liberalism which causes conflict. This article suggests that the fault lies with different norms.

These arguments suggest a liberal international approach, mixed with constructivism - repeated games could help China and the US to exit peacefully.

However, at the same time, it's hard to argue that, if domestic factors in terms of losing legitimacy (evergreen) or otherwise weren't in factor, China will accommodate the international order. There are still vast amounts of conflict that even those two argue. Additionally, with an ideological opposition, it may be hard to imagine two countries such opposed. These articles dismiss domestic sentiments as not affecting the actions of government, but we can see an overall field of ideology against China and the US. They are too far apart in ideology and terms. China calling itself communist already sets itself apart from the US (China calls for ceasefire! China calls for Russian bonds!)

Hard to argue for singularity - now huge amounts o fpower

They are in constant conflict, and [[The World Delhi Wants,, Official Indian Conceptions of International Order, c. 1998–2023.]] suggests the military force. India is afraid to condemn China, uncertain, realist, but the 'frenemy' theory suggests that realist terms have changed. No longer balance of power, but interconnection.

This does not suggest military conflict does not play a key role - balance of power theory is stated to be able to be accomplished through [[Asian Conceptions of International Order, What Asia Wants]]. Other Asian states dislike this. Constructivist approach.

As seen, co-existing is the aim, not 'replace'. As we saw, neither a liberal institutional or realist theory of how states co-exist is applicable: it ignores tension, anarchy and assumes everyone is the same. A constructivist approach is more key here. Perhaps a change of realist theory should be made (frenemy) in order to accommodate these recent changes.

Pick up the insights of realism

To what extent is nationalism > communism.

Aggressive when they afford to be?

Idea of limitation:

What extent is it being tempered by Capitalist practices?

The recognition of rare minerals, but the way in which Chinese corporations act.

To what extent is that in some way China has done well in the international order? It supported the 2008 during the financial crisis, that in many ways it is in terms of trade highly integrated.

Insofar that the transition from Britain to America was relatively smooth even though it took place in both world wars, to what extent can one envision China in establishing the Shanghai organisations, can one envision thinking about a peaceful transition into a less liberal or reformed international order.

You mentioned the BRICs, to what extent is it significant that China is joining forces and consorting with BRICs. 

Is it interesting that they're working with other states of growing economic and growing political significance? With other states of growing economic importance at the same time recognising that one really cannot see this terms of a past-by polarity (China working with India and Brazil) but working with them and being divided from them (India, China, Russia, etc). There are now different sorts of poles in the global system. One hasn't got the Europeans asking Americans to come in and take the lead, that was that. It is no longer a bipolar system that would allow Chinese hegemony and any sort of recognisable sense.

To what extent does that multipolarity show a degree of instability in the system. By this, I keep thinking of Chinese-European relations that are always delicate, some European states have joined the Shanghai organisations. One belt one road creates its own problems for other BRICs. Tensions with Indians over borders, Pakistan, Bangladesh, even tensions with the Russians. Yes, Russia is dependent on China for oil, but Russia in the past and the future have been keen on re-establishing the soviet union but the allegiance of relations. And now we got China through the 1 B 1 R moving towards perhaps some sort of political influence in these stars. So that there might be tensions between Russia and China, and they have border disputes there. There is a sense of instability within that multipolar.

Are the Philippines, they are in alliance with America, in alliance with military dimensions to that. Just that there does do seem to be a growing number of alliances that could easily become much more aggressive. 

To what extent though is that there is further instability in the system in the face of Chinese current economic problems. To what extent is Xi influenced by a nationalist overseas intervention. Taking Hong Kong took Chinese discourse about the end of humiliation. To what extent is he a prisoner of that rhetoric.
