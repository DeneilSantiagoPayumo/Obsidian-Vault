Key talking points:

Violence creates nations - the act of submission, threat and force creates a nation.
Central focus of power

This argument supposes a creation of a state.

This argument revolves around some ideas:
Treaty of Westphalia - what precipitated *was* violence
War making as organized crime - created nations

Perhaps we can look at the East Asian systems?
Wrong again! They weren't much better.

Other avenues of transformation for a state
Of the Thing of the Indies - without violence, the American nation

[[The Sovereign State and Its Competitors]]

Ten points (because we need 10...):

1. What does no nations mean? There has to be a nation, or at least  a series of random nations. What it means really is *sustained* nations. History is full of violence. 
2. Physical violence creates states. History is a series of conflicts over states enforcing their force and military power over others. Physical violence creates uncertainty - it was only *through* violence, that the idea of the sovereign state or nation was created (Link to Westphalia)
3. A link to a Darwinian approach - State making as organized crime
4. A brief explanatory look into the concept of Westphalia, only to realize that even the idea of the modern state supposes violence.
5. Is that really right? Counter-arguments in that Westphalia is only the basis of conditional sovereignty, and didn't provide anything new to the table. Still an incredibly bloody affair
6. Counterpose that argument with ideas of the Eastern tributary system, and how historians believe that this system was superior, kinder, gentle
7. Describe China as a military argument, a standard military force
8. Revolve back to Tilly's state making as organized crime, and counterpose with Henrick's argument about the state, potentially link to China and how even though it was coercion, it was still relatively peaceful
9. Argue that the basis underlying all of this was threat: China was a threatening force, damning others to being subhuman.
10. Conclude with a generalization of my main arguments.
