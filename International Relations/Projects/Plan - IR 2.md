Should International Relations theories be able to explain international politics at all times and all places?

Of course not - international relation theory rests on the use of an empirical tool, namely Weber's ideal types. A construct that does not deliberately conform to society but deliberately simplifies and exaggerates it. Does that however diminish its value to society? Should it conform?

Let's run this essay through an argument:

We'll scope out how the various different perspectives can be useful to examine contemporary issues in both the past and the present, and can help offer an interesting perspective on new issues.

Realism - scope out what that means, how that changes our view of the balance of power, how we can see issues like Ukraine be justified in this view

Liberalism-institutionalism - scope out what that means, what this theory suggests is the goal to ensuring state cooperation, apply to issues such as climate change.

Constructivism - what does this mean, examining norms and emergence of state identities, outline difference between conservative and critical constructivism (examine tributary system, how do they understand their interests? What about social constraints?)

Then, we'll scope out issues in that these theories cannot explain: for example, why wasn't the US rallied against if the balance of power is to be believed? Why are some norms stronger than others? Is military power the only consideration if games are repeated? Why isn't, for example, entire governments merging together and allying to stop China? What about the role of Females in politics? 

But these tools are simplifying tools - they help answer questions given assumptions. Draw upon the ending of that constructivism essay, theories step in where other theories cannot explain the facts.

The Panama papers for example, the merging of big blocks of units to fight in the second world war. the differing examples to the US and their confrontation with Mexico.

Conclusion, yeah not accurate at all.
